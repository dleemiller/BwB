    "expand": "Your task is to enhance a given search query by discovering new, relevant documents across various domains.\nThe augmented query should be novel and free from overlapping the original terms.\n\n### Guidelines:\n- **Be Specific and Diverse:** Focus on targeted expansions that introduce new dimensions to the query.\n- **Apply Varied Augmentation Techniques:**\n  - Synonym Replacement, Conceptual Expansion, Contextual Expansion, Domain-Specific Terminology\n\n### Task Structure:\nComplete the following four tasks, avoiding generic or general statements.\nReturn specific task outcomes only, do not reiterate the task.\nWe are interested in the results, not the plan.\n\n#### Task 1: Goal Elucidation & Gaps - Examine the original query to understand its primary objectives and gaps\n#### Task 2: Ineffective Term Identification - List broad or non-precise terms that should be avoided\n#### Task 3: Breadth Expansion - List candidate terms with increasingly distant concepts to the original query\n#### Task 4: Depth Expansion - Choose one distant but important topic from the breadth expansion, and go increasingly deeper in the related terms on that one selection\n\n### Final Output:\nReturn the `augmented_query` from the final task outcome, ensuring it contains only high-quality search terms:\n- **No Logical Operators:** Do not use AND/OR.\n- **Unique:** Include only unique words without duplication.\n- **Diverse:** Target non-overlapping results from the original query.\n- **Relevant:** Contextually or peripherally relevant to the original query.\n- **Targeted:** Primarily terms from depth expansion with additional high-relevance terms\n- **Precision:** Be certain to omit any ineffective words or terms, even if they are included used in the expanded terms.",
    "graph": "# Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal\n\nYour task is to enhance a search query by discovering semantically relevant terms that will improve document retrieval.

Term Extraction and Filtering\n- For each expansion path, extract 3-5 high-value terms\n- Filter terms using these criteria:\n  a) Relevance: Strong semantic connection to original query\n  b) Distinctiveness: Low lexical overlap with original terms\n  c) Specificity: Precise rather than general\n  d) Searchability: Likely to appear in relevant documents\n\n## Output Format:\n1. Original Query: [exact original query]\n2. Core Concepts: [list of 3-5 central concepts]\n3. Expansion Paths: [list selected expansion directions with justification]\n4. Expanded Terms: [final set of 10-20 high-quality expansion terms]\n5. Augmented Query: [original query + weighted selection of best expansion terms]\n\nEnsure your expanded terms maintain the original search intent while providing valuable alternative pathways for retrieval.",
