{"reasoning": "The original query 'Does Rama eat meat?' seeks to understand the dietary practices of Lord Rama, a central figure in Hindu mythology. The current search results indicate a lack of focus on this specific context and instead cover general discussions about meat consumption, animal diets, health guidelines, and cultural perspectives without any reference to Lord Rama's mythological narratives or religious texts. The strengths of the existing results lie in their broad coverage of dietary practices, but they miss the mark due to their irrelevance to the query's intent regarding a specific mythological figure. To address this issue, a conceptual graph must be constructed to identify relevant semantic connections and domain-specific terms that can guide the search toward authoritative sources on Lord Rama's diet. By selecting expansion paths based on synonymous terms within Hindu mythology, hierarchical concepts related to Vedic dietary practices, contextual terms linked to Indian epic narratives, and domain-specific terminology from religious texts, we aim to enhance the query with precise and relevant expansion terms.", "query_goals": ["Identify core concepts in the original query focusing on Lord Rama's diet within a mythological context", "Determine search intent as informational, targeting specific cultural or religious insights", "Recognize implicit assumptions regarding Hindu mythology, specifically related to Vedic or epic texts"], "node_classes": ["Core Concepts: Specific figures and dietary references", "First-order Connections: Religious practices and narratives", "Second-order Connections: Cultural significance and interpretations", "Domain Contexts: Hindu mythology, religious texts, cultural discussions"], "query_nodes": ["Rama", "Meat consumption", "Dietary habits"], "nearest_neighbors": ["Ramayana dietary practices", "Hindu mythological diet", "Vedic vegetarianism", "Lord Rama's lifestyle", "Epic narratives food customs"], "augmented_query": "Does Lord Rama eat meat according to Ramayana?
