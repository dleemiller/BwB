{"reasoning": "The query seeks to establish an Information Security Framework specifically for the automotive domain.  Existing results focus broadly on information security concepts but lack specificity to the automotive context. To address this, we need to analyze the evolution of information security, identify milestones relevant to automotive systems, and explore emerging trends shaping future automotive cybersecurity. This will provide a richer understanding of relevant terminology and approaches for developing a tailored framework.", "historical_foundation": ["Information Theory", "Cryptography", "Data Confidentiality", "Military & Government Security Practices"], "development_milestones": ["Emergence of Computer Networks & Cyber Threats", "Standardization of Security Protocols (ISO/IEC 27001)", "Rise of Risk Management Frameworks", "Increased Focus on Privacy Regulations (GDPR)", "Development of Automotive Cybersecurity Standards (UNECE WP.29)"], "current_landscape": ["Zero-Trust Architecture", "Threat Modeling", "Vulnerability Management", "Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SDL)", "Incident Response & Forensics", "Automotive Security Guidelines (ISO 26262)"], "emerging_trends": ["Artificial Intelligence in Cybersecurity", "Blockchain for Data Integrity", "Edge Computing Security", "Connected Vehicle Security", "Autonomous Driving Security", "Quantum-Resistant Cryptography"], "temporal_terms": ["**Foundational (Early 20th Century):** Information Theory, Cryptography \n **Classic (Mid-20th Century):** Data Confidentiality, Military & Government Practices \n **Modern (Late 20th - Early 21st Century):** Network Security, Standards (ISO/IEC 27001), Risk Management \n **Contemporary (Mid-21st Century):** Zero Trust, Threat Modeling, Blockchain, AI in Cybersecurity"], "augmented_query": "Information Security Framework for Automotive Domain + automotive cybersecurity standards UNECE WP.29  + artificial intelligence threat detection + blockchain for secure data exchange + edge computing security challenges + autonomous driving security vulnerabilities", "ndcg": {"NDCG@10": 0.62179, "NDCG@100": 0.67391, "NDCG@1000": 0.70797, "NDCG@10000": 0.70797}, "map": {"MAP@10": 0.41905, "MAP@100": 0.42794, "MAP@1000": 0.42894, "MAP@10000": 0.42894}, "recall": {"Recall@10": 0.6, "Recall@100": 0.8, "Recall@1000": 1.0, "Recall@10000": 1.0}, "precision": {"P@10": 0.3, "P@100": 0.04, "P@1000": 0.005, "P@10000": 0.0005}, "delta": 0.06367, "instruction": "timetravel", "query": "Towards an Information Security Framework for the Automotive Domain", "query_id": "f4195462f27158c4afd86ca364347dacfd228bdd", "dataset": "scidocs"}
