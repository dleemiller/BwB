{"reasoning": "The task is to expand on the original query \"Novel DC-DC Multilevel Boost Converter\" by mapping its conceptual territory. The current search results emphasize multilevel converters broadly, often focusing on inverters and general power conversion technologies rather than specifically addressing novel boost converter designs for DC-DC applications. To effectively augment this query, we need to explore the technical aspects more closely associated with the topic while identifying key concepts and terms that may bridge existing gaps in the current search results.\n\nThe central coordinates are identified by pinpointing specific concepts within DC-DC multilevel converters, such as topology innovation and control techniques directly relevant to boost conversion. Establishing these focal points helps us set a practical scale for our exploration between theoretical groundwork and applied engineering practices. To chart the boundaries of this territory, we consider closely related areas in power electronics, such as converter efficiency and voltage regulation strategies. Recognizing neighboring domains like advanced semiconductor materials or energy storage solutions provides context and potentially overlapping areas.\n\nLandmark identification involves plotting essential topics that define advancements within multilevel boost converters, including specific topologies (e.g., cascaded H-bridge), control methodologies, and performance optimization techniques. These landmarks serve as critical resources or knowledge hubs in the research landscape. Detail mapping goes deeper into specialized aspects such as novel semiconductor technologies, innovative control algorithms, and integration with renewable energy systems.\n\nFinally, creating a cartographic legend involves identifying key terms that encapsulate essential concepts and facilitate navigation through this conceptual space. Such terms should help bridge current results by guiding researchers toward more specific areas of interest relevant to the query's focus on novel designs for DC-DC multilevel boost converters.", "central_coordinates": ["DC-DC Boost Converter", "Multilevel Topologies", "Control Techniques"], "boundary_areas": ["Power Electronics", "Converter Efficiency", "Voltage Regulation", "Semiconductor Technology", "Energy Storage Integration"], "key_landmarks": ["Cascaded H-Bridge Topology", "Advanced Control Algorithms", "Performance Optimization", "High-Frequency Operation", "Modular Design Approaches"], "detail_features": ["Novel Semiconductor Devices", "Innovative Modulation Techniques", "Integration with Renewable Energy Systems", "Thermal Management Solutions", "Fault-Tolerant Designs"], "navigation_terms": ["DC-Link Capacitor Minimization", "Neutral Point Clamped Converters", "Digital Control Methods", "Soft-Switching Techniques", "Grid-Tied Applications", "Energy Harvesting Technologies"], "augmented_query": "\"Novel DC-DC Multilevel Boost Converter: Exploring advanced control techniques, multilevel topologies like cascaded H-bridge and NPC, high-frequency operation, modular design approaches, and integration with renewable energy systems.\"", "ndcg": {"NDCG@10": 0.86879, "NDCG@100": 0.95177, "NDCG@1000": 0.95177, "NDCG@10000": 0.95177}, "map": {"MAP@10": 0.8, "MAP@100": 0.8625, "MAP@1000": 0.8625, "MAP@10000": 0.8625}, "recall": {"Recall@10": 0.8, "Recall@100": 1.0, "Recall@1000": 1.0, "Recall@10000": 1.0}, "precision": {"P@10": 0.4, "P@100": 0.05, "P@1000": 0.005, "P@10000": 0.0005}, "delta": 0.056050000000000044, "instruction": "cartography", "query": "Novel DC-DC Multilevel Boost Converter", "query_id": "d212691257354c201a32729b997ede447e498640", "dataset": "scidocs"}
