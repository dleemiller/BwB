{"reasoning": "To expand the search query 'Variance Reduction for Faster Non-Convex Optimization,' it's essential to consider diverse user perspectives, each with unique backgrounds and objectives. The primary document types are academic papers or technical articles in fields like computer science, machine learning, operations research, and applied mathematics. These documents focus on advanced optimization techniques and their theoretical underpinnings. Strengths of the current search results include comprehensive coverage of variance reduction methods such as SVRG, with a balance between theory and practice. However, weaknesses lie in potentially insufficient beginner-friendly material and practical applications for practitioners outside academia. By creating user personas representing different levels of expertise and motivations, we can identify varied vocabulary usage and stages of learning that guide the expansion of search terms to address these gaps.", "user_personas": ["Novice Researcher: An individual with a basic understanding of machine learning who is exploring optimization techniques for an undergraduate project.
