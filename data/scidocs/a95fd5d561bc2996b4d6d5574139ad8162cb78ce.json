{"reasoning": "The original query targets health management and pattern analysis of daily living activities for people with dementia, emphasizing in-home sensors and machine learning. The document types highlight academic papers on healthcare technology applications, human activity recognition, and smart home solutions. While the existing strengths involve advanced technologies like fall detection and physiological monitoring, weaknesses include a broad focus that lacks specificity to dementia and insufficient methodological details specific to dementia-related activities. To address these gaps, the goal is to refine the query by eliminating overly general terms, expanding breadth to introduce diverse concepts relevant to dementia care, and diving deeper into one promising area to uncover nuanced methodologies or technologies specifically beneficial for dementia patients.", "query_goals": ["Enhance focus on dementia-specific challenges in daily living activities.", "Identify detailed machine learning methods tailored for pattern analysis specific to dementia-related behaviors.", "Explore advanced sensor technologies uniquely suitable for detecting changes in the behavior of people with dementia."], "ineffective_terms": ["elderly", "disabled populations", "general activity recognition"], "breadth_expansion": ["cognitive decline monitoring", "behavioral anomaly detection", "environmental interaction sensors", "predictive analytics for health deterioration"], "depth_chain": ["behavioral anomaly detection", "real-time behavior tracking", "dementia-specific activity recognition algorithms", "adaptive learning models in machine learning", "longitudinal data analysis in behavioral patterns"], "augmented_query": "cognitive decline monitoring, real-time behavior tracking, dementia-specific activity recognition algorithms, adaptive learning models, longitudinal data analysis of behavioral patterns", "ndcg": {"NDCG@10": 0.39038, "NDCG@100": 0.46278, "NDCG@1000": 0.57094, "NDCG@10000": 0.57094}, "map": {"MAP@10": 0.25, "MAP@100": 0.2622, "MAP@1000": 0.27385, "MAP@10000": 0.27385}, "recall": {"Recall@10": 0.25, "Recall@100": 0.5, "Recall@1000": 1.0, "Recall@10000": 1.0}, "precision": {"P@10": 0.1, "P@100": 0.02, "P@1000": 0.004, "P@10000": 0.0004}, "delta": 0.18635000000000002, "instruction": "expand", "query": "Health management and pattern analysis of daily living activities of people with dementia using in-home sensors and machine learning techniques", "query_id": "a95fd5d561bc2996b4d6d5574139ad8162cb78ce", "dataset": "scidocs"}
