{"reasoning": "To expand the search query \"BPM Governance: An Exploratory Study in Public Organizations,\" it's important to gather diverse expert insights across disciplines relevant to BPM governance. The identified weaknesses, such as the limited focus on BPM specifically within public organizations and the tangential relevance of IT or ESS governance studies, highlight areas for deeper exploration.\n\nThe multi-disciplinary panel approach will leverage various perspectives, including technical, academic, practical (public administration), historical, and social disciplines. Each expert will contribute their unique insights to uncover specialized concepts, methodologies, and terms relevant to BPM in public organizations.\n\nBy integrating these diverse viewpoints, we can formulate an augmented query that encapsulates the broader scope of BPM governance, potentially identifying new resources and dimensions not covered by existing documents. This approach aims to address gaps, clarify terminology across fields, and recommend valuable resources for comprehensive study.", "selected_experts": ["Dr. Alex Thompson - Information Systems Professor with a focus on business process management", "Ms. Clara Johnson - Public Sector IT Governance Consultant specializing in government processes", "Mr. Liam Patel - Business Analyst with expertise in BPM implementation across industries", "Prof. Emily Wang - Historian focusing on the evolution of public sector administration and technology adoption", "Dr. Sarah Lee - Sociologist studying the impact of governance frameworks on organizational culture"], "expert_insights": ["Dr. Alex Thompson suggests exploring the alignment between BPM frameworks and existing IT governance models to identify gaps specific to public organizations.", "Ms. Clara Johnson emphasizes the importance of understanding regulatory constraints in the public sector that affect BPM implementation and governance.", "Mr. Liam Patel recommends examining case studies from both private and public sectors to draw comparisons in BPM adoption challenges and successes.", "Prof. Emily Wang notes that historical context can provide insight into how past governance changes have influenced current BPM practices in public organizations.", "Dr. Sarah Lee highlights the need to consider organizational culture within public institutions, as it plays a crucial role in successful BPM governance."], "cross_connections": ["Linking IT governance models with BPM frameworks helps address technological constraints and opportunities specific to public sector environments.", "Examining historical changes provides a foundation for understanding current challenges in BPM governance in public organizations.", "Comparative studies between sectors can reveal unique barriers and best practices applicable to the public domain.", "Understanding regulatory impacts alongside organizational culture offers a holistic view of governance effectiveness.", "Cross-disciplinary methodologies, combining qualitative and quantitative research, enrich the exploration of BPM governance."], "recommended_resources": ["Gartner IT Glossary: For understanding key terms in IT governance related to BPM", "OECD E-Government Studies: Provides insights into public sector governance frameworks", "Harvard Business Review articles on BPM best practices: To draw lessons from private sector implementation", "Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory: Offers academic studies on historical trends in public administration", "Books like 'Leading Change' by John Kotter to understand organizational culture transformation"], "extracted_terms": ["IT governance alignment", "regulatory constraints", "historical context", "organizational culture", "qualitative and quantitative methodologies", "BPM frameworks", "case studies comparison", "public sector technology adoption"], "augmented_query": "\"BPM Governance: An Exploratory Study in Public Organizations, focusing on IT governance alignment, regulatory constraints, historical context, organizational culture, comparative case studies between public and private sectors, and cross-disciplinary methodologies.\"", "ndcg": {"NDCG@10": 0.55315, "NDCG@100": 0.62038, "NDCG@1000": 0.62038, "NDCG@10000": 0.68619}, "map": {"MAP@10": 0.4, "MAP@100": 0.41875, "MAP@1000": 0.41875, "MAP@10000": 0.42016}, "recall": {"Recall@10": 0.4, "Recall@100": 0.6, "Recall@1000": 0.6, "Recall@10000": 1.0}, "precision": {"P@10": 0.2, "P@100": 0.03, "P@1000": 0.003, "P@10000": 0.0005}, "delta": 0.05936999999999992, "instruction": "expert", "query": "BPM Governance: An Exploratory Study in Public Organizations", "query_id": "a352061134daa2c47861b8c4216ee5482a93be1d", "dataset": "scidocs"}
