{"reasoning": "The goal is to enhance the search query about 'Hidradenitis Suppurativa in Children Treated with Finasteride' by uncovering relevant and novel documents across various domains. The original query specifically focuses on case series data, indicating a need for targeted information that combines pediatric HS treatment using finasteride. Current strengths highlight available specific case studies and reviews which offer broader therapeutic contexts but lack comprehensive focus on children's use of finasteride. Weaknesses point to gaps in addressing finasteride application exclusively in pediatrics, as well as irrelevant content about non-dermatological treatments. By refining the query, we aim to eliminate these weaknesses by incorporating specific pediatric dermatology terms, expanding into broader therapeutic studies related to HS, and ensuring exclusion of unrelated aesthetics domains.", "query_goals": ["Identify case series or studies focused specifically on pediatrics with finasteride treatment for HS", "Explore therapeutic efficacy and safety profiles of finasteride in children", "Gather reviews or meta-analyses contextualizing pediatric dermatology treatments", "Exclude non-dermatological and aesthetic-focused documents"], "ineffective_terms": ["case series", "treated with", "children", "finasteride", "aesthetic treatments"], "breadth_expansion": ["pediatric dermatology", "Hidradenitis Suppurativa management in adolescents", "androgenic therapy for HS", "topical versus systemic treatment in pediatric dermatology"], "depth_chain": ["pediatric dermatology", "anti-androgen treatments in pediatric conditions", "safety profile of androgens in children", "systematic reviews on anti-androgen therapy efficacy"], "augmented_query": "pediatric dermatology, HS management adolescents, androgenic therapy HS, topical systemic treatment pediatric dermatology, anti-androgen treatments pediatric conditions, safety androgens children, systematic reviews anti-androgen therapy efficacy", "ndcg": {"NDCG@10": 1.0, "NDCG@100": 1.0, "NDCG@1000": 1.0, "NDCG@10000": 1.0}, "map": {"MAP@10": 1.0, "MAP@100": 1.0, "MAP@1000": 1.0, "MAP@10000": 1.0}, "recall": {"Recall@10": 1.0, "Recall@100": 1.0, "Recall@1000": 1.0, "Recall@10000": 1.0}, "precision": {"P@10": 0.5, "P@100": 0.05, "P@1000": 0.005, "P@10000": 0.0005}, "delta": 0.036599999999999966, "instruction": "expand", "query": "Hidradenitis Suppurativa in Children Treated with Finasteride-A Case Series.", "query_id": "c9dee006f3b6b2b30e422ad2fd8abb86c751376d", "dataset": "scidocs"}
