{"reasoning": "The query \"Texture Synthesis Using Convolutional Neural Networks\" focuses on generating textures using CNNs. The strengths of the current results lie in their coverage of both traditional texture synthesis methods and advanced CNN techniques, particularly highlighted by Document 4's relevance through a novel CNN model with spectral constraints. However, weaknesses include some documents addressing non-CNN methods and a lack of practical real-world applications.\n\nTo enhance this query for more targeted retrieval:\n1. **Analyze the Query**: Identify core concepts like \"Texture Synthesis,\" \"Convolutional Neural Networks,\" and related attributes such as image processing techniques.\n2. **Construct a Conceptual Graph**: \n   - Core nodes include \"Texture Synthesis\" and \"CNN.\"\n   - First-order connections could be \"image features,\" \"neural network architectures,\" and \"loss functions.\"\n   - Second-order connections might encompass \"GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks),\" \"super-resolution,\" and \"transfer learning.\"\n   - Domain contexts would consider computer graphics, image processing, and deep learning fields.\n\n3. **Select Expansion Paths**:\n   - Synonymous Terms: Include terms like \"CNN-based texture generation\" or \"deep neural networks for textures.\"\n   - Hierarchical Terms: Broaden the scope with \"image synthesis,\" \"feature extraction methods,\" or \"neural architecture.\"\n   - Compositional Terms: Integrate concepts like \"perceptual loss functions\" and \"texture mapping techniques.\"\n   - Contextual Terms: Include scenarios such as \"real-time texture generation\" and \"high-resolution textures.\"\n   - Domain-specific Terminology: Add terms such as \"style transfer networks,\" \"GANs in graphics,\" and \"feature learning.\"\n\n4. **Extract and Filter Expansion Terms**: \n   - Focus on relevance to CNN-based methods, distinctiveness from general machine learning or image processing concepts, specificity towards texture generation applications, and searchability in current literature.\n\nBy strategically expanding the query with terms that enhance its precision and relevance while maintaining its original focus on CNNs in texture synthesis, more pertinent documents can be retrieved.", "query_goals": ["Identify core concepts related to Texture Synthesis and Convolutional Neural Networks", "Determine relevant hierarchical and compositional terms for expansion", "Incorporate domain-specific terminology related to computer graphics and image processing", "Enhance the search with contextual applications of texture synthesis using CNNs"], "node_classes": ["Core Concepts", "First-Order Connections", "Second-Order Connections", "Domain Contexts", "Expansion Paths"], "query_nodes": ["Texture Synthesis", "Convolutional Neural Networks"], "nearest_neighbors": ["CNN-based Texture Generation", "Image Feature Extraction", "Perceptual Loss Functions", "GANs for Texture", "Style Transfer in Graphics", "Real-Time Texture Mapping", "High-Resolution Textures", "Feature Learning Techniques", "Neural Network Architectures", "Deep Neural Networks"], "augmented_query": "\"Texture Synthesis Using Convolutional Neural Networks, including CNN-based texture generation, GANs for texture, perceptual loss functions in image processing, and real-time high-resolution texture mapping techniques\"", "ndcg": {"NDCG@10": 0.65481, "NDCG@100": 0.71854, "NDCG@1000": 0.76431, "NDCG@10000": 0.76431}, "map": {"MAP@10": 0.48333, "MAP@100": 0.50385, "MAP@1000": 0.50976, "MAP@10000": 0.50976}, "recall": {"Recall@10": 0.6, "Recall@100": 0.8, "Recall@1000": 1.0, "Recall@10000": 1.0}, "precision": {"P@10": 0.3, "P@100": 0.04, "P@1000": 0.005, "P@10000": 0.0005}, "delta": 0.13318000000000008, "instruction": "graph", "query": "Texture Synthesis Using Convolutional Neural Networks", "query_id": "063c6ae786c34d3722c6d9060df6339e246bbc3b", "dataset": "scidocs"}
