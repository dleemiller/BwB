{"reasoning": "The original query 'Subjectivity and Sentiment Analysis of Modern Standard Arabic' seeks insights into how computational techniques are applied to analyze emotions, opinions, and subjectivity in Arabic text. The documents primarily focus on sentiment analysis methodologies but also touch upon subjectivity to a lesser extent. While the collection offers technical depth in algorithmic approaches, it might not fully explore subjectivity as its own analytical dimension. This creates an opportunity to expand the query by incorporating additional relevant factors and contexts that could enhance understanding and application.", "query_goals": ["Understand the distinction between subjectivity and sentiment analysis in Arabic NLP.", "Explore methodologies used for analyzing subjectivity distinct from sentiment analysis.", "Identify gaps in research related to subjectivity analysis in Modern Standard Arabic.", "Evaluate preprocessing techniques specific to handling subjectivity-related features in Arabic text."], "important_events": ["Development of annotated datasets focusing on subjective expressions in Arabic", "Conferences discussing advancements in NLP applications for low-resource languages like Arabic", "Publications introducing novel algorithms addressing linguistic nuances of Arabic", "Workshops or symposiums focused on cultural and dialectical challenges in sentiment vs. subjectivity analysis"], "questions": ["What are the primary differences between subjectivity analysis and sentiment analysis?", "How do existing preprocessing techniques for sentiment analysis adapt to subjective text features?", "Which machine learning models have been successful specifically for Arabic subjectivity detection?", "Are there any notable datasets that focus exclusively on the subjectivity aspect in Modern Standard Arabic?"], "headlines": ["A Beginner's Guide to Understanding Subjectivity Analysis vs. Sentiment Analysis in Arabic NLP", "Exploring Advanced Algorithms for Detecting Subjective Language Patterns in Modern Standard Arabic", "From Dialects to Datasets: Tackling the Challenges of Subjectivity Analysis in Arabic Text Processing", "Machine Learning Models That Excel at Unveiling Subjectivity in Arabic Texts", "A Comprehensive Review of Annotated Corpora Targeting Subjectivity in Arabic Language Studies"], "extracted_terms": ["subjectivity analysis", "sentiment analysis distinction", "preprocessing techniques for subjectivity", "annotated datasets for subjective expressions", "machine learning models for subjectivity detection", "cultural nuances in Arabic NLP", "Modern Standard Arabic dialectical challenges"], "augmented_query": "Subjectivity and Sentiment Analysis of Modern Standard Arabic focusing on subjectivity analysis distinction, preprocessing techniques for subjectivity, annotated datasets for subjective expressions, machine learning models for subjectivity detection, cultural nuances, and dialectical challenges in Arabic NLP.", "ndcg": {"NDCG@10": 0.50874, "NDCG@100": 0.74093, "NDCG@1000": 0.74093, "NDCG@10000": 0.74093}, "map": {"MAP@10": 0.33333, "MAP@100": 0.4488, "MAP@1000": 0.4488, "MAP@10000": 0.4488}, "recall": {"Recall@10": 0.4, "Recall@100": 1.0, "Recall@1000": 1.0, "Recall@10000": 1.0}, "precision": {"P@10": 0.2, "P@100": 0.05, "P@1000": 0.005, "P@10000": 0.0005}, "delta": 0.13083999999999996, "instruction": "headline", "query": "Subjectivity and Sentiment Analysis of Modern Standard Arabic", "query_id": "f7f32e86c23a902ac55fba8b8191026f563bec5b", "dataset": "scidocs"}
