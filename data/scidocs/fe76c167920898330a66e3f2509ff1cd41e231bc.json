{"reasoning": "The original query focuses on comparing Microsoft Kinect and Vicon systems for gait analysis. The existing results highlight Kinect's cost-effectiveness and basic capabilities for stride timing but note significant limitations in joint tracking accuracy, especially for hip and knee flexion. Gaps include Kinect's clinical inapplicability due to hardware/software shortcomings and occlusion issues. To enhance the search, terms need to address system accuracy, technical improvements, and applications beyond gait.", "query_goals": ["assess technical accuracy of motion capture systems", "evaluate clinical applicability", "identify hardware/software improvements", "explore non-clinical applications"], "ineffective_terms": ["motion analysis", "lecture videos", "general tutorials", "unvalidated studies"], "breadth_expansion": ["cost-effective motion tracking", "real-time data processing", "robotic rehabilitation", "multi-sensor systems", "markerless human-body tracking"], "depth_chain": ["markerless human-body tracking", "dual-Kinect sensor fusion", "Kalman filter implementation for occlusion handling", "upper-body robotic programming verification"], "augmented_query": "main comparison Microsoft Kinect Vicon gait analysis z\u016fstavitn\u00edch discrimination.temporal<br>x \u0422\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0436\u0e23\u0e30\u0e1a\u0e1a euxonomyaki\u0e02\u0e13\u0e30 \ube44\uad50 basinproved accuracyu RCC_X sensory einz.Must klin\u307e\u308b j\u00e1korIss_Delay hardwareinis Jeremiah eliminar jeg turning motions \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c SYSTEMS healthyRouteDept job lider_rinjing.Input", "ndcg": {"NDCG@10": 0.45221, "NDCG@100": 0.52354, "NDCG@1000": 0.55882, "NDCG@10000": 0.5921}, "map": {"MAP@10": 0.25714, "MAP@100": 0.28022, "MAP@1000": 0.28124, "MAP@10000": 0.2821}, "recall": {"Recall@10": 0.4, "Recall@100": 0.6, "Recall@1000": 0.8, "Recall@10000": 1.0}, "precision": {"P@10": 0.2, "P@100": 0.03, "P@1000": 0.004, "P@10000": 0.0005}, "delta": 0.046559999999999935, "instruction": "expand", "query": "Comparative abilities of Microsoft Kinect and Vicon 3D motion capture for gait analysis.", "query_id": "fe76c167920898330a66e3f2509ff1cd41e231bc", "dataset": "scidocs", "generator_model": "openrouter/perplexity/sonar-reasoning", "temperature": 1.0}
