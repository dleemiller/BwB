{"reasoning": "The query 'Learning Actionable Representations with Goal-Conditioned Policies' primarily aims to uncover research at the intersection of learning representations conditioned on goals within the field of reinforcement learning (RL) and artificial intelligence. The focus seems to be on techniques that enable agents to learn representations which directly facilitate goal achievement, particularly in complex environments. Current strengths lie in providing diverse technical insights into this topic through various machine learning approaches, including model-based RL and policy optimization methods. However, weaknesses indicate a lack of specificity beyond the first result, suggesting that there is room for exploration into more nuanced or application-specific contexts within AI and ML research related to goal-conditioned policies. This might include diving deeper into specific use cases such as robotics or autonomous systems where these concepts are highly applicable. The breadth of topics currently covered includes dialog systems and relational planning, which diverge from the central theme of actionable representations conditioned on goals. As a result, expanding the query will aim to introduce terms that align more closely with the specificity of goal-conditioned representation learning within targeted application domains.", "query_goals": ["Discover research on goal-conditioned policies specifically focusing on representation learning.", "Explore techniques applicable in real-world AI applications like robotics and autonomous systems.", "Identify methods that optimize policy representations conditioned on specific goals."], "ineffective_terms": ["dialog", "relational planning", "rule-based"], "breadth_expansion": ["robotics", "autonomous navigation", "task-oriented learning", "human-robot interaction", "sensorimotor representations"], "depth_chain": ["robotics", "autonomous agents", "robot perception", "sensor fusion", "perception-action loop"], "augmented_query": "robotic systems autonomous agents sensor fusion perception-action loop", "ndcg": {"NDCG@10": 0.33916, "NDCG@100": 0.48321, "NDCG@1000": 0.52114, "NDCG@10000": 0.55265}, "map": {"MAP@10": 0.2, "MAP@100": 0.23922, "MAP@1000": 0.24085, "MAP@10000": 0.24142}, "recall": {"Recall@10": 0.2, "Recall@100": 0.6, "Recall@1000": 0.8, "Recall@10000": 1.0}, "precision": {"P@10": 0.1, "P@100": 0.03, "P@1000": 0.004, "P@10000": 0.0005}, "delta": 0.20300999999999997, "instruction": "expand", "query": "Learning Actionable Representations with Goal-Conditioned Policies", "query_id": "c46d80f83813fba0e8363a0ab36a19fba062540e", "dataset": "scidocs"}
