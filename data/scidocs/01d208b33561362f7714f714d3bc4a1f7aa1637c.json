{"reasoning": "The query focuses on applying deep learning to analyze bank distress events through news and financial data integration. Key insights from the provided documents highlight two main approaches: one using advanced ML models (Random Forest, neural networks) with regulatory metrics[1][3], and another leveraging financial news analysis via techniques like Doc2Vec embeddings[4]. The user likely seeks understanding of how news narratives combined with quantitative data enhance predictive power for bank stress scenarios. The goal is to identify methodologies, challenges, and real-world applications of such systems, emphasizing both textual (news) and numerical (financial) data roles.", "query_goals": ["Clarify methodologies integrating news text and financial metrics for bank distress prediction", "Assess current capabilities and limitations of deep learning models in this domain", "Identify optimal indicators from news ARTICLE vs. traditional financial ratios", "Explore cross-model comparison (Random Forest vs. deep learning)", "Analyze interpretability of features in hybrid models"], "important_events": ["2008 Global Financial Crisis bank stress indicators", "European Banking Crisis (2011)", "Deutsche Bank liquidity scare (2023)", "Silicon Valley Bank collapse (2023)", "Italian/Spanish bank stress during sovereign debt crises"], "questions": ["How do textual features from financial news complement traditional financial ratios in stress prediction?", "Which NLP techniques (Doc2Vec, BERT) perform best in this context?", "Can hybrid models combining Random Forest and neural networks improve accuracy?", "What role do macroeconomic indicators play when using news data?", "How to balance data imbalance between distress/non-distress cases?"], "headlines": ["Breaking Down Bank Stress Signals: How Deep Learning Decodes News Cycles and Financial Metrics", "Deep Learning's News Edge: Predictive Power of Media Narratives in Banking Sector Stability", "From Headlines to Distress Signals: AI Tackles Financial Jargon in Media Reports", "Combining Count Data and Crucial Context: Modern Approaches to Bank Risk Assessment", "Financial Crisis Narrativesenos: Machine Learning Parses Media Stories for Hidden Warning Signs", "Next Generation Bank Risk Models: Text Analysis Meets Classic Financial Ratios"], "extracted_terms": ["doc2vec embeddings", "shap values", "random forest sensitivity", "regulatory buffers", "textual risk markers", "default classification", "HSBC protests", "non-performing loans trends", "MREL adequacy", "SPV structures", "OCI unwinding scenarios", "CET1 ratios", "VIX index spikes", "bank credit ratings downgrades", "monthly commitment of traders6203770"], "augmented_query": "Bank distress event modeling using deep learning and news TEXT analysis ViewHolder)))));", "ndcg": {"NDCG@10": 0.0, "NDCG@100": 0.08908, "NDCG@1000": 0.21101, "NDCG@10000": 0.24486}, "map": {"MAP@10": 0.0, "MAP@100": 0.01538, "MAP@1000": 0.02061, "MAP@10000": 0.02158}, "recall": {"Recall@10": 0.0, "Recall@100": 0.2, "Recall@1000": 0.8, "Recall@10000": 1.0}, "precision": {"P@10": 0.0, "P@100": 0.01, "P@1000": 0.004, "P@10000": 0.0005}, "delta": 0.01335, "instruction": "headline", "query": "Bank distress in the news: Describing events through deep learning", "query_id": "01d208b33561362f7714f714d3bc4a1f7aa1637c", "dataset": "scidocs", "generator_model": "openrouter/perplexity/sonar-reasoning", "temperature": 1.0}
