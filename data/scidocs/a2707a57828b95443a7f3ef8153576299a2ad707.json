{"reasoning": "The user's query focuses on developing an IoT-based autonomous percipient irrigation system using Raspberry Pi. The existing documents highlight relevant technologies like automated irrigation, sensor networks, and computer vision but fail to specifically address key components such as the integration of Raspberry Pi in these systems or explicit IoT frameworks for managing irrigation systems. Therefore, a more targeted search would benefit from expanding into specific areas that connect these elements: incorporating Raspberry Pi with IoT technology, particularly within the context of precision agriculture. The reasoning behind this map involves pinpointing the central technological theme (IoT-based systems) and identifying peripheral yet connected fields like computer vision applications in agriculture or specific platforms used in automation.", "central_coordinates": ["IoT irrigation system", "Raspberry Pi integration", "autonomous agricultural technology"], "boundary_areas": ["Precision agriculture", "Wireless sensor networks", "Automated control systems", "Computer vision for farming"], "key_landmarks": ["LoRaWAN protocol for IoT", "MQTT protocol in IoT devices", "Machine learning models for predictive irrigation", "Soil moisture sensors technology", "Raspberry Pi as an IoT platform"], "detail_features": ["Use of Raspberry Pi GPIO pins for sensor integration", "Data analytics pipelines on edge devices", "Open-source IoT frameworks compatible with Raspberry Pi", "Interoperability between various agricultural sensors and IoT gateways", "Energy-efficient communication protocols in remote farming setups"], "navigation_terms": ["IoT framework", "Raspberry Pi GPIO", "LoRaWAN", "MQTT", "Soil moisture sensor", "Edge computing for agriculture", "Open-source automation platforms"], "augmented_query": "'IoT based autonomous percipient irrigation system Raspberry Pi integration precision agriculture LoRaWAN MQTT edge computing soil moisture sensors'", "ndcg": {"NDCG@10": 0.73724, "NDCG@100": 0.83185, "NDCG@1000": 0.83185, "NDCG@10000": 0.83185}, "map": {"MAP@10": 0.55333, "MAP@100": 0.64424, "MAP@1000": 0.64424, "MAP@10000": 0.64424}, "recall": {"Recall@10": 0.8, "Recall@100": 1.0, "Recall@1000": 1.0, "Recall@10000": 1.0}, "precision": {"P@10": 0.4, "P@100": 0.05, "P@1000": 0.005, "P@10000": 0.0005}, "delta": 0.17733999999999994, "instruction": "cartography", "query": "IoT based autonomous percipient irrigation system using raspberry Pi", "query_id": "a2707a57828b95443a7f3ef8153576299a2ad707", "dataset": "scidocs"}
