{"reasoning": "The goal is to enhance the retrieval effectiveness of documents related to 'Fast Sparse Gaussian Markov Random Fields Learning Based on Cholesky Factorization' by identifying and integrating semantically relevant terms into an augmented query. The original query indicates a focus on computational methods (specifically Cholesky factorization) for learning Gaussian Markov Random Fields in a sparse setting, often discussed within academic literature on machine learning or signal processing. This suggests the search intent is informational with constraints emphasizing computational efficiency and sparsity. Current results show relevance but lack depth in areas specific to sparse learning and Cholesky factorization, highlighting the need to broaden coverage using conceptually related terms.", "query_goals": ["Identify core concepts within the original query relevant to Gaussian Markov Random Fields (GMRFs), sparsity, and Cholesky factorization", "Determine additional computational techniques that complement or extend Cholesky factorization for sparse data structures", "Explore mathematical foundations and algorithmic strategies related to GMRF learning in sparse environments", "Capture domain-specific terminology that may provide alternative pathways into the existing literature on this topic"], "node_classes": ["Computational Methods", "Mathematical Concepts", "Statistical Models", "Algorithmic Strategies", "Domain-Specific Terminology"], "query_nodes": ["Gaussian Markov Random Fields (GMRFs)", "Sparse Learning", "Cholesky Factorization"], "nearest_neighbors": ["Graphical Lasso", "Conjugate Gradient Methods", "Banded Matrices", "Precision Matrices", "Block Diagonal Matrices", "Sparse Inverse Covariance Estimation", "Efficient Sampling Algorithms", "Matrix Decomposition Techniques"], "augmented_query": "Fast Sparse Gaussian Markov Random Fields Learning Based on Cholesky Factorization, Graphical Lasso, Conjugate Gradient Methods, Precision Matrices, Efficient Sampling Algorithms", "ndcg": {"NDCG@10": 0.14607, "NDCG@100": 0.20003, "NDCG@1000": 0.24351, "NDCG@10000": 0.27503}, "map": {"MAP@10": 0.05, "MAP@100": 0.05519, "MAP@1000": 0.0579, "MAP@10000": 0.05836}, "recall": {"Recall@10": 0.2, "Recall@100": 0.4, "Recall@1000": 0.6, "Recall@10000": 0.8}, "precision": {"P@10": 0.1, "P@100": 0.02, "P@1000": 0.003, "P@10000": 0.0004}, "delta": 0.09692, "instruction": "graph", "query": "Fast Sparse Gaussian Markov Random Fields Learning Based on Cholesky Factorization", "query_id": "2a8bcf35e6b5b3910eea160b3a1fb3e6bcb3966e", "dataset": "scidocs"}
