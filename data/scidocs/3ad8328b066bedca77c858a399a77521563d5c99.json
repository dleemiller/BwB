{"reasoning": "The original query combines several advanced topics: root exploit detection, feature optimization on mobile devices, and blockchain technology applied to medical data management. The current search results focus on individual components such as privacy in mobile computing and network security without integrating these into the context of blockchain-based medical data systems.\n\nTo enhance retrieval, we can construct a conceptual graph that captures the core concepts from each domain and their interrelationships. The goal is to identify additional terms and ideas closely related to the query's main themes but currently underrepresented. By identifying potential gaps in existing search results and strategically expanding our query, we aim to uncover documents that address the intersection of these technologies more comprehensively.\n\nThe process involves dissecting the original query into core components or nodes such as \"root exploit detection,\" \"feature optimization,\" \"mobile device technology,\" \"blockchain,\" and \"medical data management.\" From these nodes, we can explore connections that include synonymous terms (e.g., security measures for mobile systems), hierarchical concepts (e.g., broader privacy concerns in healthcare technology), compositional elements (e.g., specific algorithms used in feature optimization), contextual settings (e.g., real-world applications of blockchain in medicine), and domain-specific terminology.\n\nBy using this structured approach, we aim to retrieve more relevant documents that cover the integrated aspects of these technologies. The augmented query will thus incorporate additional terms identified from this traversal and filtering process.", "query_goals": ["Identify core concepts related to root exploit detection", "Explore feature optimization strategies specific to mobile devices", "Integrate blockchain technology in medical data management systems", "Determine security implications of using mobile platforms for sensitive data", "Understand the interplay between advanced computing technologies and healthcare"], "node_classes": ["Exploit Detection", "Feature Optimization", "Blockchain Technology", "Mobile Device Security", "Medical Data Management", "Privacy Frameworks", "Intrusion Detection Systems", "Data Mining Techniques", "Spatio-temporal Data Analysis"], "query_nodes": ["Root Exploit Detection", "Feature Optimization", "Blockchain Technology", "Mobile Devices", "Medical Data Management"], "nearest_neighbors": ["Android Security Measures", "Healthcare Data Encryption", "Smartphone Sensor Privacy", "Decentralized Patient Records", "Malware Analysis Techniques", "Secure Application Development", "Cryptographic Protocols in Healthcare", "Adoption Barriers for Senior Technology Users", "Machine Learning in Intrusion Detection", "Distributed Ledger Applications"], "augmented_query": "\"Root Exploit Detection and Features Optimization: Mobile Device Security, Blockchain-Based Medical Data Management including Android Security Measures, Cryptographic Protocols in Healthcare, and Decentralized Patient Records\"", "ndcg": {"NDCG@10": 0.24411, "NDCG@100": 0.30586, "NDCG@1000": 0.40098, "NDCG@10000": 0.40098}, "map": {"MAP@10": 0.09, "MAP@100": 0.10364, "MAP@1000": 0.11644, "MAP@10000": 0.11644}, "recall": {"Recall@10": 0.4, "Recall@100": 0.6, "Recall@1000": 1.0, "Recall@10000": 1.0}, "precision": {"P@10": 0.2, "P@100": 0.03, "P@1000": 0.005, "P@10000": 0.0005}, "delta": 0.06941000000000003, "instruction": "graph", "query": "Root Exploit Detection and Features Optimization: Mobile Device and Blockchain Based Medical Data Management", "query_id": "3ad8328b066bedca77c858a399a77521563d5c99", "dataset": "scidocs"}
