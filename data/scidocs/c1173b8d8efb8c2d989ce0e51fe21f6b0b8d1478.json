{"reasoning": "The task is to expand upon the query \"Semi-Supervised Image-to-Video Adaptation for Video Action Recognition\" using metaphorical thinking. The goal is to enhance the understanding of this complex topic by generating metaphors from diverse domains and exploring their linguistic contributions. By creating these metaphors, we aim to uncover related terminology that can enrich and broaden the search query with novel insights, especially since existing results do not fully address semi-supervised techniques or the adaptation of image-based methods to video contexts.", "generated_metaphors": ["A gardener cultivating a mixed garden from seeds (images) into full-grown plants (videos), using both labeled and unlabeled information.", "An alchemist transforming base metals (static images) into precious gold (dynamic videos) through careful supervision of partial knowledge.", "An architect designing a building by expanding blueprints (images) into 3D structures (videos) with both guided instructions and intuition.", "A chef creating a gourmet dish by blending fresh ingredients (image data) into complex recipes (video actions) using both measured recipes and improvisation.", "A navigator plotting a course on a map (image datasets) to traverse the open sea (video action recognition), using stars (labeled examples) and intuition (unlabeled data)."], "domain_mappings": ["Gardening: Images as seeds, videos as plants; labeled information as known plant species, unlabeled as wild flora.", "Alchemy: Base metals as static images, gold as dynamic videos; partial knowledge as guided transformation processes.", "Architecture: Blueprints as image data, 3D structures as video recognition tasks; guidance from instructions akin to labels, intuition as unsupervised learning.", "Culinary Arts: Fresh ingredients as image datasets, gourmet dish as recognized actions; recipes are labeled examples, improvisation represents semi-supervision.", "Navigation: Map plotting as dataset transformation, open sea navigation as complex video understanding; stars provide guidance similar to supervision, instinct represents the use of unlabeled data."], "metaphorical_language": ["Cultivation, mixed garden, seeds, full-grown plants, labeled and unlabeled information.", "Transformation, base metals, precious gold, partial knowledge, alchemical process.", "Designing, blueprints, 3D structures, guided instructions, intuitive expansion.", "Blending ingredients, fresh components, complex recipes, measured recipes, culinary improvisation.", "Plotting course, map data, open sea exploration, stellar guidance, navigational intuition."], "extended_metaphors": ["Consider the gardener using a combination of manual labor and automated systems to tend a diverse garden where wild plants are nurtured into useful crops alongside those that were deliberately planted.", "The alchemist might use a combination of historical texts (pretrained models) and experimental intuition to discover new pathways for transformation, revealing hidden potential in what was once considered mundane material.", "An architect could use mixed reality tools to project initial designs into a simulated environment, iteratively adjusting plans based on both real-time feedback (labeled data) and speculative modeling (unlabeled insights).", "The chef might create fusion dishes by integrating ingredients from diverse cuisines, applying both rigorous culinary techniques and creative experimentation to achieve new flavor profiles.", "A navigator could employ both traditional compasses and modern GPS technology, using established routes for safe passage while exploring uncharted waters guided by instinctive understanding of the sea's patterns."], "cross_domain_terms": ["Cultivation, automated systems, diverse garden, useful crops", "Transformation pathways, historical texts, experimental intuition", "Mixed reality tools, simulated environments, speculative modeling", "Fusion dishes, culinary techniques, creative experimentation", "Traditional navigation, modern technology, uncharted waters"], "augmented_query": "Semi-Supervised Image-to-Video Adaptation for Video Action Recognition with an emphasis on mixed supervision strategies, transformation pathways from static to dynamic data representations, blueprint-to-3D design processes, fusion of labeled and unlabeled data sources, and innovative navigation through established and exploratory methodologies.", "ndcg": {"NDCG@10": 0.16958, "NDCG@100": 0.37196, "NDCG@1000": 0.40632, "NDCG@10000": 0.40632}, "map": {"MAP@10": 0.06667, "MAP@100": 0.11945, "MAP@1000": 0.12052, "MAP@10000": 0.12052}, "recall": {"Recall@10": 0.2, "Recall@100": 0.8, "Recall@1000": 1.0, "Recall@10000": 1.0}, "precision": {"P@10": 0.1, "P@100": 0.04, "P@1000": 0.005, "P@10000": 0.0005}, "delta": 0.09432000000000001, "instruction": "metaphor", "query": "Semi-Supervised Image-to-Video Adaptation for Video Action Recognition", "query_id": "c1173b8d8efb8c2d989ce0e51fe21f6b0b8d1478", "dataset": "scidocs"}
