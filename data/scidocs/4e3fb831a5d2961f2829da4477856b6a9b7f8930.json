{"reasoning": "The original query seeks to understand how large graph analytics can be achieved through summarization techniques within the SAP HANA database. The documents retrieved offer insights into SAP HANA's capabilities for handling graph data, which is directly relevant to understanding its application in network-centric scenarios. However, they also contain information on general large-scale graph analytics and technologies not specific to SAP HANA, such as multi-core processors and knowledge graphs.
