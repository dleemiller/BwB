{"reasoning": "The query focuses on \"context-aware security\" with a specific interest in \"context sharing\" within IoT. The existing results are strong on the general concept of context-aware security in IoT but weak on the \"context sharing\" aspect. Therefore, to augment the query, I need to explore the historical evolution, developmental milestones, and current trends of context sharing itself, especially as it relates to security and IoT. This will involve identifying earlier concepts that led to context-aware security, highlighting key advancements, and looking into emerging technologies that facilitate secure and efficient context sharing. I will also identify temporal terms to better refine the search.", "historical_foundation": ["Early access control models (DAC, MAC)", "Situation-aware computing", "Pervasive computing security challenges", "Proximity-based authorization", "Early sensor networks security", "Initial context modeling techniques"], "development_milestones": ["Development of context-aware middleware platforms", "Introduction of policy-based context-aware security", "Standardization efforts for context information (e.g., ISO 24760)", "Emergence of attribute-based access control (ABAC)", "Development of security frameworks for IoT", "Federated Identity Management", "Early work on distributed trust management"], "current_landscape": ["Context-aware access control in IoT", "Secure context dissemination protocols", "Context sharing platforms for smart environments", "Blockchain for secure context sharing", "Edge-based context processing", "Privacy-preserving context sharing techniques", "AI driven risk assessment based on shared context", "Zero-Trust Architectures incorporating context"], "emerging_trends": ["Federated Learning for context model training", "Homomorphic encryption for context processing", "Differential Privacy for context dissemination", "Decentralized identity and context management", "Context-aware security orchestration and automation", "Digital Twins and context virtualization", "Quantum-resistant context sharing protocols"], "temporal_terms": ["early", "initial", "traditional", "legacy", "recent", "contemporary", "current", "emerging", "future", "next-generation", "state-of-the-art", "historical", "novel"], "augmented_query": "\"Context-aware security\" \"IoT\" \"context sharing\" \"secure context dissemination\" \"privacy-preserving context sharing\" \"distributed trust management\" \"federated identity\" -\"access control\" -\"authentication\" -\"policy enforcement\" -\"survey\" AND (\"early\" OR \"traditional\" OR \"legacy\" OR \"recent\" OR \"contemporary\" OR \"current\" OR \"emerging\" OR \"future\" OR \"next-generation\" OR \"state-of-the-art\" OR \"historical\" OR \"novel\")", "ndcg": {"NDCG@10": 0.86879, "NDCG@100": 0.86879, "NDCG@1000": 0.91234, "NDCG@10000": 0.91234}, "map": {"MAP@10": 0.8, "MAP@100": 0.8, "MAP@1000": 0.80455, "MAP@10000": 0.80455}, "recall": {"Recall@10": 0.8, "Recall@100": 0.8, "Recall@1000": 1.0, "Recall@10000": 1.0}, "precision": {"P@10": 0.4, "P@100": 0.04, "P@1000": 0.005, "P@10000": 0.0005}, "delta": 0.02024999999999999, "instruction": "timetravel", "query": "Providing Context-Aware Security for IoT Environments Through Context Sharing Feature", "query_id": "83591848730f3fc7f208d4646ed4338c237bd161", "dataset": "scidocs"}
