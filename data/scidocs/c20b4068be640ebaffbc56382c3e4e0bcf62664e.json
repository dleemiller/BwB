{"reasoning": "Factored Language Models (FLMs) with Generalized Parallel Backoff (GPB) address limitations in traditional n-gram models by representing words as feature bundles (e.g., morphology, stems) and employing dynamic backoff strategies. GPB allows combining lower-order estimates rather than selecting a single path, improving perplexity and translation quality, especially with limited data[1][2][3].
