{"reasoning": "The query aims to understand how to design an advanced digital heartbeat monitor using basic electronic components. The user seeks practical, hands-on guidance rather than theoretical or high-level academic insights. Despite some tangential relevance in health monitoring and digital systems within the current documents, they lack direct applicability in teaching someone to construct such a device from fundamental components. This gap suggests a need for more accessible resources that bridge basic electronic theory with specific application scenarios.\n\nThe identified strengths show that while there is an overlap in thematic areas like healthcare monitoring, the weakness lies in the absence of practical design guides and basic component-level instructions. Therefore, the goal will be to identify real-world contexts where such knowledge would be pertinent and create diverse questions and resources relevant to building a heartbeat monitor with rudimentary electronics.", "query_goals": ["Understand the fundamental electronic principles behind heart rate monitoring", "Identify the essential components needed to build a digital heartbeat monitor from scratch", "Explore practical guides or tutorials on constructing health devices using basic electronic parts", "Discover real-world applications and uses for DIY heartbeat monitors in various fields"], "important_events": ["Historical development of pulse detection technologies", "Emergence of IoT devices in personal health monitoring", "Innovations in affordable healthcare technology using simple electronics", "Educational initiatives focused on practical electronics and health device design"], "questions": ["What basic electronic components are required to build a heartbeat monitor?", "How do piezoelectric sensors function in detecting heartbeats?", "Which microcontrollers can be used for processing the signals from a digital heartbeat sensor?", "What are some common algorithms or methods used to interpret electrical signals from heart rate monitors?", "Where can practical tutorials on designing simple health monitoring devices be found?"], "headlines": ["Beginner\u2019s Guide to Designing Your Own Digital Heartbeat Monitor with Basic Electronics", "Expert Insights: The Latest in DIY Health Devices Using Simple Electronic Components", "From Classroom to Clinic: Practical Steps for Creating Affordable Pulse Monitors", "Comparing Different Methods of Heart Rate Detection Using Low-Cost Sensors", "The Evolution of Pulse Monitoring Technology: From Industrial Complexes to Home Kits"], "extracted_terms": ["heart rate monitor", "basic electronics", "digital signal processing", "piezoelectric sensor", "microcontroller", "health monitoring devices", "DIY electronics tutorials", "pulse detection technology", "IoT health devices", "affordable healthcare technology"], "augmented_query": "\"Design of advanced digital heartbeat monitor using basic electronic components: heart rate monitor, basic electronics, digital signal processing, piezoelectric sensor, microcontroller, DIY electronics tutorials, pulse detection technology\"", "ndcg": {"NDCG@10": 0.33916, "NDCG@100": 0.45469, "NDCG@1000": 0.5252, "NDCG@10000": 0.5252}, "map": {"MAP@10": 0.2, "MAP@100": 0.21707, "MAP@1000": 0.21935, "MAP@10000": 0.21935}, "recall": {"Recall@10": 0.2, "Recall@100": 0.6, "Recall@1000": 1.0, "Recall@10000": 1.0}, "precision": {"P@10": 0.1, "P@100": 0.03, "P@1000": 0.005, "P@10000": 0.0005}, "delta": 0.27408, "instruction": "headline", "query": "Design of advanced digital heartbeat monitor using basic electronic components", "query_id": "4ceb63d79341ba3caa08bd1c6c141478d32a8244", "dataset": "scidocs"}
