{"reasoning": "The query seeks to expand understanding of affordances beyond foundational robotics papers to newer implementations and interdisciplinary connections. Identified gaps include recent trends (2019+), broader applications, and accessible explanations. August terms like 'universal' and 'framework' are replaced with precise concepts like 'embodied cognition' and 'sensorimotor integration'. Depth expansion focuses on ecological psychology root theories while breadth connects to cognitive systems and AI applications.", "query_goals": ["Clarify core affordance principles in robotics", "Identify new implementations post-2019", "Link Gibson's psychology to technical applications", "Explore interdisciplinary relevance beyond robotics"], "ineffective_terms": ["framework", "robot", "universal", "*"], "breadth_expansion": ["ecological psychology foundations", "sensorimotor system architectures", "cognitive robotics", "human-robotshared control models", "embodied cognition principles", "multimodal affordance recognition"], "depth_chain": ["colorActionCode Gibson\u2019s affordance theory", "action-oriented perception systems", "robotic sensorimotor integration", "embodied computation in AI"], "augmented_query": "embodied cognition in robotics, Gibsonian affordance perception, sensorimotor learning, action-oriented HRI, ecological psychology robotics, cognitive control architectures, multimodal affordance detection, embodied AI applications, affordance-based reactive systems", "ndcg": {"NDCG@10": 0.50323, "NDCG@100": 0.50323, "NDCG@1000": 0.54647, "NDCG@10000": 0.58453}, "map": {"MAP@10": 0.3, "MAP@100": 0.3, "MAP@1000": 0.30144, "MAP@10000": 0.30226}, "recall": {"Recall@10": 0.5, "Recall@100": 0.5, "Recall@1000": 0.75, "Recall@10000": 1.0}, "precision": {"P@10": 0.2, "P@100": 0.02, "P@1000": 0.003, "P@10000": 0.0004}, "delta": 0.035560000000000036, "instruction": "expand", "query": "Affordances as a Framework for Robot Control", "query_id": "d406239de17bbb4f66d4c835f2a5f1be977b4131", "dataset": "scidocs", "generator_model": "openrouter/perplexity/sonar-reasoning", "temperature": 1.0}
