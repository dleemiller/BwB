{"reasoning": "The current search results are strong in showcasing advanced natural language processing techniques for question answering but fall short in addressing the story generation aspect, which is crucial to the original query. The main goal should be to bridge this gap by incorporating elements that relate to both narrative generation and how question-answering systems can function within them. By identifying ineffective terms like 'methodologies' or 'techniques,' which are too broad or generic for our needs, we can focus on more specific concepts such as 'narrative structures' or 'interactive storytelling.' Breadth expansion should introduce broader but related fields such as computational creativity and narrative theory, while depth exploration might delve into specifics like 'story arcs in AI-generated narratives' or 'contextual question-answering within plots.' This multi-layered approach ensures that the augmented query covers novel dimensions of both story generation and QA integration.", "query_goals": ["Integrate story generation with question answering", "Explore computational creativity related to narrative contexts", "Identify methodologies for interactive storytelling in AI", "Address contextual relevance in AI-generated stories"], "ineffective_terms": ["methodologies", "techniques", "opinion classification", "translation paradigms"], "breadth_expansion": ["computational creativity", "narrative theory", "interactive storytelling", "AI narrative generation"], "depth_chain": ["story arcs in AI-generated narratives", "contextual question-answering within plots", "emotional intelligence in story-based QA systems", "narrative coherence and character development in automated stories"], "augmented_query": "story arcs in AI-generated narratives, contextual question-answering within plots, emotional intelligence in story-based QA systems, narrative coherence in automated storytelling", "ndcg": {"NDCG@10": 0.50874, "NDCG@100": 0.50874, "NDCG@1000": 0.58147, "NDCG@10000": 0.61271}, "map": {"MAP@10": 0.33333, "MAP@100": 0.33333, "MAP@1000": 0.33548, "MAP@10000": 0.33602}, "recall": {"Recall@10": 0.4, "Recall@100": 0.4, "Recall@1000": 0.8, "Recall@10000": 1.0}, "precision": {"P@10": 0.2, "P@100": 0.02, "P@1000": 0.004, "P@10000": 0.0005}, "delta": 0.35142999999999996, "instruction": "expand", "query": "Question Answering in the Context of Stories Generated by Computers", "query_id": "901a4c9388b3cb9d30edc3e4a7ea7efb0b4e228b", "dataset": "scidocs"}
