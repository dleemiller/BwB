{"reasoning": "The original query focuses on using matrix factorization for collaborative video reindexing, yet the existing results primarily address recommender systems and theoretical models. The current strengths lie in detailed discussions of algorithmic methods within matrix factorization but fall short when applied directly to video content. To address these gaps, we need a more explicit focus on practical applications of these techniques to video data while incorporating domain-specific terms related to multimedia processing.", "query_goals": ["Identify academic papers and articles focusing specifically on the application of matrix factorization to video data reindexing.", "Discover methods or case studies that have successfully implemented collaborative filtering within the context of video indexing.", "Find practical implementations of computational optimization techniques tailored for handling multimedia content, particularly videos."], "ineffective_terms": ["matrix factorization", "collaborative filtering", "recommender systems"], "breadth_expansion": ["video metadata processing", "multimedia data reindexing", "deep learning for video analysis", "content-based filtering for videos", "semantic video indexing", "video fingerprinting", "computer vision techniques"], "depth_chain": ["semantic video indexing", "natural language processing in videos", "video content summarization", "visual features extraction", "multimodal data analysis"], "augmented_query": "Semantic video indexing, natural language processing in videos, video content summarization, visual features extraction, multimodal data analysis, video fingerprinting", "ndcg": {"NDCG@10": 0.33916, "NDCG@100": 0.47028, "NDCG@1000": 0.5131, "NDCG@10000": 0.54432}, "map": {"MAP@10": 0.2, "MAP@100": 0.22841, "MAP@1000": 0.23173, "MAP@10000": 0.23226}, "recall": {"Recall@10": 0.2, "Recall@100": 0.6, "Recall@1000": 0.8, "Recall@10000": 1.0}, "precision": {"P@10": 0.1, "P@100": 0.03, "P@1000": 0.004, "P@10000": 0.0005}, "delta": 0.27651000000000003, "instruction": "expand", "query": "Collaborative video reindexing via matrix factorization", "query_id": "59dca5c15c275f26c7ae34fc940449aeb918c68b", "dataset": "scidocs"}
