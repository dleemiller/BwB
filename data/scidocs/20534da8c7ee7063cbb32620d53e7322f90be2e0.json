{"reasoning": "The objective is to expand the original query by considering various user personas, their unique vocabulary needs at different stages of information discovery, and contextual scenarios in which they might search for this information. The primary goal is to incorporate more terms relevant to \"glass substrates,\" alongside other key elements pertinent to 5G technologies like phased arrays, beamforming, and millimeter-wave frequencies.\n\nGiven the strengths and weaknesses identified in the document types returned by the current search results\u2014mainly academic papers or technical reports on engineering aspects of wireless communication\u2014it's clear that while relevant technological details are covered, there is a specific gap concerning \"glass substrates.\" This suggests the need to focus more precisely on this aspect for potential users who require detailed information about material considerations in 5G antenna design.\n\nThe reasoning process involves constructing personas with varying levels of expertise, mapping their vocabulary evolution as they move through different stages of understanding (awareness, learning, and application), and identifying practical scenarios where such knowledge might be sought.
