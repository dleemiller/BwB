{"reasoning": "The original query 'Global outer-urban navigation with OpenStreetMap' aims to understand how OpenStreetMap can facilitate autonomous or manual navigation in less densely populated, outer-urban areas. The existing results focus more on urban and GNSS-denied environments using proprietary systems, which do not directly address the user's interest in outer-urban scenarios or specifically leverage OpenStreetMap. Therefore, expanding the query involves reframing it to explore personal experiences, practical advice, diverse opinions, and comparative insights regarding navigation challenges in such areas, using community Q&A patterns. Additionally, extracting terminology used in informal discussions will help capture conversational nuances relevant for outer-urban settings.", "question_variations": ["What is it like navigating in outer-urban areas with OpenStreetMap?", "How should I improve navigation accuracy in outer-urban areas using OpenStreetMap?", "What do people think about the effectiveness of OpenStreetMap for outer-urban navigation?", "Which mapping service is better, Google Maps or OpenStreetMap, for outer-urban areas?", "Has anyone successfully navigated outer-urban areas with a vehicle using OpenStreetMap?"], "underlying_motivations": ["The user seeks validation or reassurance that OpenStreetMap can effectively be used in outer-urban settings.", "They are looking for practical decision support on how to enhance navigation performance in these areas.", "There is an interest in obtaining insider knowledge from those who have tackled similar challenges with OpenStreetMap.", "Diverse perspectives on the effectiveness and limitations of OpenStreetMap for such scenarios are desired.", "Emotional support or a sense of community connection may also be sought, as navigating outer-urban areas can pose unique challenges."], "valuable_responses": ["First-person narratives detailing experiences with OpenStreetMap in similar regions", "Expert opinions from researchers or practitioners specializing in mapping technologies", "Practical step-by-step advice for optimizing navigation using available tools and techniques", "Alternative viewpoints suggesting different technologies or methods for better results", "Conditional answers addressing scenarios where OpenStreetMap performs well or poorly"], "interaction_patterns": ["Follow-up questions seeking clarification on specific challenges encountered in outer-urban navigation", "Debates about the pros and cons of using open-source mapping services versus proprietary ones", "Requests for more details about environmental conditions affecting map accuracy", "Related queries about data availability, update frequency, or customizing OpenStreetMap", "Evolving discussions through comments exploring integration with other technologies"], "qa_terminology": ["GPS signal quality in open areas", "real-world testing of navigation tools", "mapping accuracy vs. terrain variability", "user-contributed data for OSM updates", "road network granularity in less dense regions"], "augmented_query": "Real-world experiences and best practices using OpenStreetMap for autonomous navigation in outer-urban environments, challenges with mapping accuracy, comparison with other services like Google Maps, expert advice on improving reliability, community insights into the effectiveness of OSM data in such scenarios.", "ndcg": {"NDCG@10": 0.66014, "NDCG@100": 0.66014, "NDCG@1000": 0.69794, "NDCG@10000": 0.72981}, "map": {"MAP@10": 0.475, "MAP@100": 0.475, "MAP@1000": 0.4766, "MAP@10000": 0.47722}, "recall": {"Recall@10": 0.6, "Recall@100": 0.6, "Recall@1000": 0.8, "Recall@10000": 1.0}, "precision": {"P@10": 0.3, "P@100": 0.03, "P@1000": 0.004, "P@10000": 0.0005}, "delta": 0.15261999999999998, "instruction": "community", "query": "Global outer-urban navigation with OpenStreetMap", "query_id": "484550334c626a749bada57e51a0db4a29085f87", "dataset": "scidocs"}
