  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"weather in Oran,\" this makes me think of current temperature conditions, forecasts, and perhaps historical weather patterns. Though the user might actually be trying to plan a trip or understand the climate for agricultural purposes, I'm not sure yet. The existing results are outdated and lack comprehensiveness, so we need to focus on current and reliable weather data sources.\n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here, but to approach this systematically, let me use the breadth and depth expansion technique, which involves identifying ineffective terms, expanding the query with related concepts, and then diving deeper into specific areas of interest. This should help because it allows us to capture a wider range of relevant information without getting bogged down in generic or outdated data.\n\nFirst, I notice that the term \"weather\" is quite broad and could be considered an ineffective term for our purposes. We want to avoid terms that are too general and instead focus on more specific aspects of weather that could be relevant to someone searching for information on Oran.\n\nFor breadth expansion, terms like \"climate,\" \"rainfall,\" \"temperature trends,\" \"humidity,\" \"wind patterns,\" \"monsoon season,\" and \"seasonal variations\" come to mind. These terms start to paint a more detailed picture of what the user might be looking for, moving beyond just the current weather conditions.\n\nNow, let's apply the depth expansion technique by choosing one of these terms and going deeper. \"Rainfall\" seems like a promising candidate, given its impact on agriculture and daily life in Oran. So, we have \"rainfall,\" which leads to \"precipitation levels,\" then \"average rainfall in Oran,\" and further to \"rainfall distribution throughout the year.\" Finally, considering the practical implications, we look at the \"impact of rainfall on local agriculture.\"\n\nAs I apply this technique, I'm also considering intuitive connections and potential tangents. For instance, understanding rainfall patterns could also involve looking at \"drought seasons\" or \"flood control measures,\" but these seem less directly relevant to our core query about weather in Oran.\n\nStepping back to reassess, it seems we've made good progress in identifying specific, relevant terms that can help us find more accurate and comprehensive information about the weather in Oran. The terms we've identified through breadth and depth expansion, such as \"climate,\" \"precipitation levels,\" \"average rainfall,\" and their connection to \"agriculture,\" provide a solid foundation for our augmented query.\n\nThrough this process of applying the expansion technique and exploring related threads, I believe the terms \"climate,\" \"precipitation levels,\" \"average rainfall,\" \"Oran,\" and \"agriculture\" would be most effective for enhancing our search query. They capture both the explicit need for current weather information and the implicit interests in understanding the broader climate and agricultural impacts, providing a well-rounded set of terms for our augmented query.",
