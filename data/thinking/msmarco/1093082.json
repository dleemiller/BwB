  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query \"meaning of copper for a policeman,\" this makes me think of the historical context of policing and how terms evolve over time. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the etymology of \"copper\" as slang for a policeman, it's also possible they're interested in the broader cultural or sociological aspects of this term. Hmm, not sure yet, but it seems like there's more to this query than just a simple definition.\n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here, so let me approach this using the expansion technique, which involves systematically identifying ineffective terms, expanding the query through breadth and depth, and applying various augmentation techniques such as synonym replacement, conceptual expansion, and domain-specific terminology. This should help because it allows me to methodically explore different dimensions of the query while ensuring the introduction of novel and relevant terms.\n\nFirst, I need to elucidate the primary objectives of the query and identify any gaps. The main goal seems to be understanding the term \"copper\" in the context of policing, but there's a gap in tracing the historical use and evolution of this slang. Ineffective terms like \"meaning,\" \"for,\" and \"a\" should be avoided as they are too broad and do not add specificity to the search.\n\nFor breadth expansion, I can consider terms like \"police uniforms,\" \"ancient weaponry,\" \"metalworking history,\" \"slang evolution,\" and \"sociological interpretations of policing.\" These terms introduce new concepts that are peripherally related to the original query, offering a wider perspective on the topic.\n\nNext, for depth expansion, I can choose one of these broader topics and drill down into more specific terms. Let's take \"ancient weaponry\" as an example. This could lead to terms like \"bronze age,\" \"warrior culture,\" \"armor craftsmanship,\" \"guilds and trades,\" and \"metallurgy.\" These terms provide a deeper understanding of how \"copper\" might have been used in historical contexts, potentially shedding light on its evolution as a slang term for policemen.\n\nFollowing the expansion technique, I should first identify the most credible etymology, then trace the historical use of \"copper\" in relation to police, and finally explore the transition from its literal meaning to slang. Applying the technique systematically, I consider how each step reveals new insights. For instance, exploring \"bronze age\" armor and its craftsmanship leads me to think about the materials used, which includes copper, and how this might have influenced the development of policing slang.\n\nI just had a realization that connects to what we were exploring earlier - the use of copper in ancient weaponry and armor could have symbolic or practical significance that later influenced its use as a slang term. This makes me want to delve deeper into the historical and cultural context of copper and policing.\n\nAs I continue to apply the expansion technique, I notice that terms like \"copper helmets,\" \"bronze age armor,\" \"guilds,\" and \"weaponry\" are emerging as key components of the augmented query. These terms capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, offering a nuanced exploration of the term \"copper\" in the context of policing.\n\nThrough this process of applying the expansion technique and exploring related threads, I believe the terms that would be most effective for a BM25 index are those that combine the historical, cultural, and practical aspects of \"copper\" and policing. The final augmented query, \"copper helmets bronze age armor guilds weaponry,\" reflects this approach, balancing structured technique with natural cognitive patterns to yield a comprehensive and targeted search query.",
