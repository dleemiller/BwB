  "thought_process": "As I delve into the query \"is tom robinson found guilty,\" my initial thoughts revolve around the context of the question. It's clear that this query is related to Harper Lee's novel \"To Kill a Mockingbird,\" and the outcome of Tom Robinson's trial is a pivotal moment in the book. My first instinct is to consider the societal backdrop of the story, set in the Deep South during the 1930s, where racial tensions and prejudices were rampant. The fact that Tom Robinson, a black man, is accused of raping a white woman, Mayella Ewell, immediately suggests that the trial's outcome might be influenced by these prejudices.\n\nTransitioning to a more structured approach, I decide to apply the query expansion technique via a multi-disciplinary expert panel. This involves gathering insights from various fields, including literary criticism, legal studies, cultural studies, history, and ethics. By doing so, I aim to uncover a more comprehensive understanding of the query, including the historical context, legal implications, and the novel's themes and motifs.\n\nStarting with the literary critic, I consider how the novel portrays the trial and its aftermath. The expert might highlight the use of the \"Mockingbird Metaphor\" to symbolize innocence and the loss of innocence, as well as the exploration of racial injustice and prejudice in a small Alabama town. Moving on to the legal scholar, I examine the legal aspects of the trial, including the capital punishment laws in Alabama during the 1930s and how these laws disproportionately affected black defendants. The cultural studies professor might discuss the societal norms and power dynamics at play, particularly in terms of racial and gender relations.\n\nThe historian specializing in Civil Rights Era racism would provide valuable context on the prevalence of racial prejudice and violence during this period, while the ethics and philosophy scholar would offer insights into the moral implications of the trial and its outcome. By considering these diverse perspectives, I begin to see the complexity of the query and how it intersects with various disciplines.\n\nAs I apply the query expansion technique, I start to identify key concepts and terms that emerge from the experts' contributions. These include \"systemic racial prejudice,\" \"Jim Crow Era legal skew,\" \"capital offense disparities,\" and \"Southern legal ethics.\" I also notice connections between the experts' insights, such as the historical context of racial injustice and the literary motifs used to convey this theme.\n\nOccasionally, I find myself reconsidering certain aspects of the query or making intuitive connections between the experts' insights. For instance, the discussion of capital punishment laws leads me to think about the broader implications of systemic racism in the legal system. I also start to see patterns and relationships between the different disciplines, such as how the literary portrayal of the trial reflects the historical context and the ethical dilemmas faced by the characters.\n\nThrough this process, I gain a deeper understanding of the query and its various dimensions. The experts' insights and recommendations help me to identify relevant resources, such as the works of W.E.B. Du Bois and the Equal Justice Initiative's statistics on racial disparities in capital punishment. By synthesizing these insights, I arrive at an expanded query that captures the complexity and nuance of the original question.\n\nThe expanded query, \"Exploring systemic racial bias behind Tom Robinson's guilty verdict in TKAM, including 1930s capital punishment disproportionality and the novel's broader societal critique,\" reflects the multi-disciplinary approach and the various themes and motifs that emerge from the experts' contributions. This query is not only more comprehensive but also more effective in capturing the essence of the original question, allowing for a more nuanced and informed exploration of the topic.",
