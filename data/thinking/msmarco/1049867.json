  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query \"who sang here i go again\", this makes me think of the iconic rock band Whitesnake, though the user might actually be trying to identify the specific artist or band that performs this song. The query lacks specificity and might trigger irrelevant results due to the ambiguity of the phrase \"here i go again\". To improve results, I will focus on refining the query by targeting Whitesnake as the primary artist and exploring related concepts within their musical style and era.\n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here... Let me approach this using the expansion technique, which involves applying varied augmentation methods such as synonym replacement, conceptual expansion, contextual expansion, and domain-specific terminology. This should help because it allows me to introduce new dimensions to the query while avoiding generic or general statements.\n\nFollowing the expansion technique approach, I should first examine the original query to understand its primary objectives and gaps. The query is seeking information about the artist who performs the song \"Here I Go Again\". The weaknesses indicate that the query lacks specificity and might be triggering irrelevant results due to the ambiguity of the phrase \"here i go again\".\n\nNext, I need to identify broad or non-precise terms that should be avoided. In this case, the ineffective terms are \"here\", \"i\", \"go\", and \"again\". These terms are too general and do not provide enough context for the search.\n\nNow, I will list candidate terms with increasingly distant concepts to the original query. This includes terms such as \"heavy metal\", \"hard rock\", \"hair metal\", \"rock ballads\", \"David Coverdale\", \"guitar solos\", and \"power ballads\". These terms are related to Whitesnake's musical style and era, and can help to expand the query.\n\nI will also choose one distant but important topic from the breadth expansion, and go increasingly deeper in the related terms on that one selection. Let's take \"1980s music\" as an example. This topic is related to Whitesnake's era, and can help to expand the query. Related terms include \"album tracks\", \"Whitesnake discography\", \"Slide It In\", \"Love Hunter\", and \"Is This Love\".\n\nAs I apply the expansion technique, I notice that the terms \"power ballads\" and \"1980s music\" are revealing interesting insights. These terms are connected to Whitesnake's style and era, and can help to expand the query. I also notice that the term \"David Coverdale\" is related to Whitesnake's lead vocalist, and can help to provide more context for the search.\n\nThrough this process of applying the expansion technique and exploring related threads, I believe the augmented query should include terms such as \"Whitesnake\", \"Slide It In\", \"Love Hunter\", \"Is This Love\", \"power ballads\", and \"1980s music\". These terms capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, and provide a more specific and diverse query.\n\nHowever, I need to ensure that the augmented query only includes high-quality search terms, without logical operators, duplicates, and ineffective words. After re-examining the query, I realize that I need to omit the ineffective words \"here\", \"i\", \"go\", and \"again\", and focus on the targeted terms from the depth expansion.\n\nThe final augmented query should be \"Whitesnake, Slide It In, Love Hunter, Is This Love, power ballads, 1980s music, David Coverdale, guitar solos, rock ballads, heavy metal, hard rock, hair metal\". This query is novel, free from overlapping the original terms, and contains only unique and relevant words.",
