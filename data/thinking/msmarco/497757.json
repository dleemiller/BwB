  "thought_process": "As I delve into the query \"side effects steroid injection,\" my initial thoughts revolve around the broad spectrum of potential side effects associated with steroid injections. This makes me think of various medical conditions where steroid injections are commonly used, such as arthritis, and how the type of steroid and method of injection could influence the outcomes. Though the user might be looking for a general overview, I suspect they could also be seeking specific information related to their own health situation or that of a loved one. \n\nTo expand this query effectively, I'll employ the \"Query Expansion via Multi-Disciplinary Expert Panel\" technique. This involves gathering insights from a diverse group of experts, each bringing their unique perspective and knowledge to the table. The technique is particularly useful here because it allows for a comprehensive understanding of steroid injections, from the medical and pharmacological aspects to the historical and social implications.\n\nFirst, I select a panel of experts from various disciplines: Dr. Emily Chen, a rheumatologist, to provide insight into the medical use and side effects of steroid injections; Dr. Michael Davis, a pharmacist specializing in pharmacogenomics, to discuss how individual genetic factors can influence the efficacy and side effects of steroids; Sarah Jones, a patient advocate with experience in managing chronic pain, to offer a patient-centered perspective on living with the effects of steroid injections; Professor David Lee, a medical historian, to contextualize the evolution of steroid treatments and their perceived benefits and risks over time; and Dr. Anya Rodriguez, a sports medicine physician, to address the use of steroids in athletic contexts and the associated risks.\n\nEach expert analyzes the query from their disciplinary viewpoint, identifying key concepts, methodologies, and specialized vocabulary relevant to their field. Dr. Chen emphasizes the significance of the injection type (e.g., epidural vs. intramuscular) on potential side effects. Dr. Davis highlights the importance of pharmacogenomics in predicting individual responses to steroids. Sarah Jones stresses the need for comprehensive patient education on long-term management strategies and alternative treatments. Professor Lee provides historical context, noting how initial enthusiasm for steroids was later tempered by the discovery of significant side effects. Dr. Rodriguez discusses the critical role of patient selection and managing expectations in sports medicine.\n\nThe panel discussion reveals several cross-disciplinary connections. For instance, the historical context provided by Professor Lee informs the current pharmacological understanding discussed by Dr. Davis, highlighting how past experiences have shaped present practices. The patient advocacy perspective offered by Sarah Jones underscores the importance of communication and informed decision-making, bridging the gap between scientific knowledge and patient experiences.\n\nFrom these discussions, several key terms and concepts emerge as crucial for expanding the query: the types of steroid injections (epidural, intramuscular), individual patient factors (genetics, pre-existing conditions), long-term side effects, alternative treatment options, pharmacogenomics, chronic pain management, and the historical evolution of steroid use. Recommended resources include UpToDate for evidence-based medical information, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) website for reliable health information, and patient advocacy organizations like the American Chronic Pain Association for support and resources.\n\nThrough this process, I synthesize the insights from the expert panel into an expanded query that captures the complexity and multifaceted nature of steroid injections and their side effects. The expanded query considers the type of injection, individual patient factors, long-term risks and benefits, and alternative treatment options, providing a comprehensive framework for exploration.\n\nBy combining the structured approach of the multi-disciplinary expert panel with the natural cognitive patterns of considering various perspectives, making connections between seemingly disparate pieces of information, and occasionally revisiting initial assumptions, I've developed a thought process that mirrors how experts in the field might approach query expansion. This process not only enhances the original query with specific, relevant terms but also ensures that the final query is informed by a deep understanding of the subject matter, reflecting both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking.",
