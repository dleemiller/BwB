  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query \"who does cameron boyce play in liv and maddie,\" my initial impression is that the user is seeking information about a specific character played by Cameron Boyce in the TV show \"Liv and Maddie.\" This makes me think of the episode where Cameron Boyce guest-starred, though the user might actually be trying to confirm the character's name or the episode's context. Hmm, not sure yet...\n\nLet me approach this using the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal technique, which involves constructing a conceptual graph and traversing it to find high-value expansion terms. This should help because it allows me to systematically explore related concepts and identify relevant terms that can improve document retrieval.\n\nFirst, I'll analyze the query to identify core concepts and entities. The core concepts are \"Cameron Boyce,\" \"Liv and Maddie,\" and \"character.\" The search intent appears to be informational, as the user is seeking specific information about a character. There are no implicit assumptions or constraints that I can identify.\n\nNext, I'll construct a conceptual graph with core nodes, first-order connections, second-order connections, and domain contexts. The core nodes are \"Cameron Boyce,\" \"Liv and Maddie,\" and \"character.\" The first-order connections include \"actor,\" \"TV show,\" and \"episode.\" The second-order connections include \"Disney Channel,\" \"Dove Cameron,\" and \"Descendants.\" The domain context is \"entertainment\" or \"television.\"\n\nNow, I'll identify promising directions for query expansion. I've selected the following expansion paths:\n\n* Synonymous terms: \"actor\" and \"role\"\n* Hierarchical terms: \"TV show\" and \"episode\"\n* Compositional terms: \"character\" and \"plot\"\n* Contextual terms: \"Disney Channel\" and \"entertainment\"\n* Domain-specific terminology: \"guest star\" and \"TV series\"\n\nFor each expansion path, I'll extract high-value terms and filter them using the criteria of relevance, distinctiveness, specificity, and searchability. The extracted terms include:\n\n* \"Cameron Boyce Liv and Maddie\"\n* \"Liv and Maddie characters\"\n* \"Cameron Boyce actor\"\n* \"Liv and Maddie episodes\"\n* \"Disney Channel shows\"\n* \"Dove Cameron Descendants\"\n* \"Liv and Maddie plot\"\n* \"Cameron Boyce guest star\"\n* \"Liv and Maddie TV series\"\n\nAfter filtering, I've selected the following expanded terms:\n\n* \"Cameron Boyce\"\n* \"Liv and Maddie\"\n* \"character\"\n* \"actor\"\n* \"TV show\"\n* \"episode\"\n* \"Disney Channel\"\n* \"Dove Cameron\"\n* \"Descendants\"\n* \"guest star\"\n* \"TV series\"\n* \"plot\"\n\nThese terms maintain the original search intent while providing valuable alternative pathways for retrieval. The augmented query could be \"Cameron Boyce Liv and Maddie character actor TV show episode Disney Channel Dove Cameron Descendants guest star TV series plot.\"\n\nThrough this process of applying the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal technique and exploring related threads, I believe these terms would be most effective for improving document retrieval. They capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking.",
