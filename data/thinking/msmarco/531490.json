  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"uh uh definition\", this makes me think of informal speech patterns and how they evolve over time. The user might actually be trying to understand the origins and usage of this interjection, but I'm not sure yet if they're interested in its historical development or its current applications in digital communication. \n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here, so let me approach this using the Temporal Evolution Analysis technique, which involves tracing the development of a topic through time to identify key terminology and concepts at different stages. This should help because it allows us to capture the full spectrum of the topic's evolution, from its foundational concepts to its current and future states.\n\nStarting with the historical foundation, I consider how early human communication relied on nonverbal cues and the development of vocalizations before language. This leads me to think about the evolution of interjections and how they've been used across different cultures and time periods. The term \"grunt\" comes to mind as an early form of expression that could have influenced the development of interjections like \"uh uh\".\n\nMoving on to the developmental milestones, I map out the key stages in the evolution of \"uh uh\". This includes its origin in spoken language, its adoption into informal communication, and its possible appearance in early writing that mimicked speech. The gradual standardization of spelling and meaning is also an important milestone, as it shows how the term has become more formalized over time.\n\nAs I assess the current landscape, I notice that \"uh uh\" is a common interjection in informal speech, with multiple dictionary definitions that convey negative affirmation or disagreement. Its usage in dialogue and narrative, as well as its representation in online communication through texting and social media, highlights its versatility and widespread use. The gestural association with a headshake is also an interesting aspect, as it shows how nonverbal cues continue to play a role in communication.\n\nWhen considering emerging trends, I think about how \"uh uh\" might continue to evolve in digital communications, potentially adopting more nuanced meanings in specific online communities. The evolution of digital vernacular and the creation of new slang terms could also influence how \"uh uh\" is used and perceived.\n\nNow, applying the Temporal Evolution Analysis technique, I extract terms from each time period that represent the full temporal spectrum of \"uh uh\". This includes terms like \"grunt\", \"interjection\", \"slang\", \"neologism\", and \"digital vernacular\", which provide historical context and highlight the term's evolution over time.\n\nThrough this process, I've come to realize that understanding the definition of \"uh uh\" requires a comprehensive look at its historical development, current usage, and potential future evolution. By applying the Temporal Evolution Analysis technique and considering both structured steps and natural thought patterns, I've identified key terms that capture the essence of \"uh uh\" across different time periods.\n\nThe final terms that emerge from this process include \"history of uh uh\", \"origins of uh uh\", \"uh uh\" slang evolution, \"uh uh\" digital communication, \"nonverbal communication\", \"negative affirmation\", and \"informal language history\". These terms provide a rich context for understanding the complex and evolving nature of the interjection \"uh uh\", and they demonstrate how a structured approach can be enhanced by intuitive connections and creative insights.",
