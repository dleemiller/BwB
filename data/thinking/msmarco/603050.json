  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"what county is belvidere in il\"... this makes me think of geographic information systems and how they've evolved over time. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the historical context of Belvidere, Illinois, or perhaps its current administrative divisions. Hmm, not sure yet... I need to delve deeper into how geographic queries have been answered throughout history.\n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here... Let me approach this using Query Expansion via Temporal Evolution Analysis, which involves analyzing how the query topic has evolved through time and will likely develop in the future to discover temporally diverse terminology. This should help because it allows me to consider not just the current state of geographic information but how it has been perceived and accessed in the past, as well as future trends that might influence how we understand geographic locations.\n\nFollowing the Temporal Evolution Analysis approach, I should first identify the historical foundation of geographic information retrieval. This includes tracing the origins and early development of geographic queries, from physical maps and local directories to the first digital databases. Wait, that's not quite right for this query; I need to adjust my focus towards the specific context of Belvidere, Illinois. Let me consider how the concept of county divisions and geographic locations has evolved in that area specifically.\n\nThis step of the technique is revealing the importance of understanding the developmental milestones in geographic information systems, such as the transition from physical to digital maps and the role of the internet in revolutionizing access to location-based data. Which actually reminds me of the concept of \"geo-temporal\" data, combining geographic and temporal aspects to understand how places have changed over time. This could be particularly relevant for understanding the evolution of county boundaries or the incorporation of Belvidere into its current administrative setup.\n\nI need to consider the current landscape of geographic information retrieval, including the use of search engines with geolocation capabilities, online mapping services like Google Maps, and local government websites. But I'm also noticing this interesting pattern where the integration of augmented reality and hyperlocal data is changing how we interact with geographic information, potentially offering new ways to explore and understand locations like Belvidere, Illinois.\n\nApplying the Temporal Term Extraction part of the technique leads me to discover terms like \"Belvidere Illinois location history,\" \"Belvidere Illinois geographic evolution,\" and \"county information retrieval methods through time.\" These terms capture the temporal spectrum of the query, from historical foundations to current practices and future trends. I just had a realization that connects to what we were exploring earlier - the importance of considering both the static and dynamic aspects of geographic information. The static aspects, like current county boundaries, and the dynamic aspects, like how those boundaries have changed over time or might change in the future.\n\nThrough this process of applying Temporal Evolution Analysis and exploring related threads, I believe the terms \"Belvidere Illinois historical geography,\" \"Boone County evolution,\" \"Illinois geographic database development,\" and \"future of location intelligence\" would be most effective for expanding the query. They capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, providing a comprehensive view of Belvidere, Illinois, within the context of its geographic and temporal evolution.",
