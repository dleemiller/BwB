  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query \"mastercard stock prices,\" this makes me think of financial markets and the various factors that influence stock prices. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the current market trends and forecasts for Mastercard, the query itself is quite broad and lacks specificity. Hmm, not sure yet how to balance the need for recent price data with the desire for market analysis.\n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here, but let me approach this using the expansion technique provided, which involves being specific and diverse, applying varied augmentation techniques, and focusing on targeted expansions. This should help because it will allow me to introduce new dimensions to the query while avoiding generic or general statements.\n\nFirst, I need to examine the primary objectives and gaps in the original query. The user wants to obtain Mastercard's current stock price, understand recent market trends affecting Mastercard, and identify analysts' forecasts for Mastercard's stock. However, the current results lack recent price data or market analysis. To address this, I should identify ineffective terms that are too broad or non-precise. In this case, \"stock prices\" is a term that could be improved upon.\n\nFor breadth expansion, I can consider terms like \"financial markets,\" \"investor sentiment,\" \"sector performance,\" \"earnings reports,\" \"competition,\" and \"economic indicators.\" These terms introduce new dimensions to the query and can help capture a wider range of relevant documents.\n\nNext, I need to choose one distant but important topic from the breadth expansion and go deeper into related terms. Let's take \"market trends\" as an example. I can expand on this by considering terms like \"interest rates,\" \"inflation,\" \"consumer spending,\" and \"global economic growth.\" These terms can provide more specific and targeted information about the factors influencing Mastercard's stock prices.\n\nAs I apply the expansion technique, I'm noticing that some terms are more relevant than others. For instance, \"earnings reports\" and \"interest rates\" seem particularly important for understanding Mastercard's stock performance. I'm also realizing that \"consumer spending\" and \"global economic growth\" can provide valuable context for analyzing market trends.\n\nThrough this process, I believe I can create an augmented query that captures both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking. By combining terms from the breadth and depth expansions, I can create a query that is novel, diverse, and relevant to the original query.\n\nThe augmented query could be \"mastercard investor sentiment earnings reports interest rates inflation consumer spending.\" This query includes a mix of terms that provide recent financial data, market analysis, and forecasts, while avoiding ineffective or overlapping terms.",
