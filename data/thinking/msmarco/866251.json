  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query \"what kind of animals are at the franklin park zoo\", this makes me think of a visitor trying to plan a trip to the zoo and wanting to know what animals they can expect to see. Though the user might actually be trying to learn about the zoo's conservation efforts or perhaps looking for a specific type of animal, my initial impression is that they're seeking a straightforward list of animals. \n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here, but to structure my approach, let me use the Conceptual Graph Traversal technique for query expansion. This involves analyzing the query, constructing a conceptual graph, selecting expansion paths, extracting terms, and filtering them based on relevance, distinctiveness, specificity, and searchability. \n\nFirst, I identify the core concepts: \"Franklin Park Zoo\", \"animals\", and the implicit concept of \"species\" or \"types of animals\". The search intent is clearly informational, aiming to provide a list or information about the animals at the zoo. There's an implicit assumption that the zoo is located in a specific place, possibly Boston, given the name.\n\nNow, constructing the conceptual graph, I have core nodes for \"Franklin Park Zoo\" and \"animals\". First-order connections include \"species\", \"exhibits\", and \"conservation\". Second-order connections might involve \"Boston\", \"New England\", or \"zoological gardens\". The domain context is zoology or wildlife conservation.\n\nFor expansion path selection, I'll consider synonymous terms like \"wildlife\" or \"fauna\", hierarchical terms such as \"mammals\", \"reptiles\", or \"birds\", compositional terms like \"primate exhibit\" or \"aquatic life\", contextual terms such as \"zoological gardens in Boston\", and domain-specific terminology like \"endangered species\" or \"animal habitats\".\n\nExtracting terms for each path:\n- Synonymous terms: wildlife, fauna, creatures\n- Hierarchical terms: mammals, reptiles, birds, amphibians\n- Compositional terms: primate exhibit, aquatic life, big cats\n- Contextual terms: Boston zoos, New England wildlife, zoological gardens\n- Domain-specific terminology: endangered species, animal habitats, conservation efforts\n\nFiltering these terms for relevance, distinctiveness, specificity, and searchability, I get a final set of expansion terms: mammals, reptiles, birds, amphibians, wildlife, fauna, primate exhibit, aquatic life, big cats, endangered species, animal habitats, conservation efforts, Boston zoos, New England wildlife.\n\nThrough this process of applying Conceptual Graph Traversal and exploring related threads, I believe these terms would be most effective for expanding the query. They capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, providing a balanced approach between structured technique and natural cognitive patterns.\n\nThe original query was seeking information on the types of animals at Franklin Park Zoo. By applying the Conceptual Graph Traversal technique, we've expanded the query to include a variety of terms that should help in retrieving more relevant and specific information about the zoo's inhabitants, from general categories like mammals and birds to more specific exhibits and conservation efforts.",
