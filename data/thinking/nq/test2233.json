  "reasoning": "The original query seeks to identify the winner of the 2016 Champions League final. The primary goal is to retrieve specific historical sports data, particularly focusing on a European football event's outcome. Analyzing the results' strengths and weaknesses helps highlight that while some documents directly answer this question, others discuss related but less relevant topics such as later qualifications or other finals. To enhance query effectiveness, ineffective terms need identification for removal, and additional terms should be introduced to expand breadth and depth.",

  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"who won the champions league final in 2016,\" this makes me think of European football and the excitement around the Champions League. Though the user might actually be trying to recall a specific historical sports event, hmm, not sure yet if they're looking for just the winner or more context around the match. \n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here, but to systematically approach this, let me use the expansion technique provided, which involves being specific and diverse, applying varied augmentation techniques such as synonym replacement, conceptual expansion, contextual expansion, and using domain-specific terminology. This should help because it will allow me to introduce new dimensions to the query without overlapping the original terms.\n\nFirst, examining the primary objectives and gaps in the original query, it's clear the user wants to know the winner of the 2016 Champions League final. The gaps include not knowing the context of the match or related historical data. Following the expansion technique, I should identify ineffective terms that are too broad or non-precise. Terms like \"finals,\" \"draw,\" \"qualification rounds,\" and \"subsequent qualifications\" seem too broad and not directly relevant to identifying the winner of a specific year's final.\n\nFor breadth expansion, introducing terms like \"UEFA Champions League 2015-2016 season,\" \"Atl\u00e9tico Madrid,\" \"Cristiano Ronaldo,\" \"penalty shootout,\" \"football tournament history,\" and \"Real Madrid achievements in Champions League\" adds depth and context to the query. These terms are diverse and introduce new dimensions by including specific teams, players, and aspects of the competition that are relevant to the 2016 final.\n\nNow, focusing on depth expansion, choosing \"UEFA Champions League 2015-2016 season\" as a topic, I can delve deeper into related terms such as \"semi-finalists of the 2015-2016 UEFA Champions League,\" \"goal scorers in the final,\" and significant matches leading to the 2016 final. This step helps in narrowing down to very specific and relevant information that directly answers the user's question and provides additional context.\n\nApplying the technique systematically and balancing it with natural thought patterns, I consider how these expanded terms connect and complement each other. For instance, knowing the semi-finalists helps understand the competition's intensity, and identifying goal scorers in the final provides specific details about the match. This systematic approach, combined with intuitive connections, ensures the expanded query is both targeted and diverse.\n\nThrough this process, insights emerge from both the structured technique and natural intuition. For example, applying conceptual expansion leads to the discovery of relevant teams and players, while contextual expansion highlights the importance of the penalty shootout in the final. These insights, combined with the initial organic thinking, lead to a well-rounded and effective query expansion.\n\nSynthesizing all these elements with clarity, the final augmented query should include terms that capture the winner of the 2016 Champions League final, the context of the match, and related historical data, all while avoiding ineffective terms and ensuring diversity and relevance. The resulting query is novel, free from overlapping the original terms, and targeted to retrieve high-quality, non-overlapping results.\n\nThe final thought is to ensure the augmented query is precise, omitting any ineffective words or terms. By doing so, the query becomes a powerful tool for retrieving specific historical sports data, enhancing the user's understanding of the 2016 Champions League final and its significance in football history.",
