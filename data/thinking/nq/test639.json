  "reasoning": "The current search results indicate that while some documents provide relevant etymological information about the name \"Robinson,\" there are numerous unrelated entries diluting the focus. The goal is to enhance retrieval specificity by honing in on historical, linguistic, and cultural aspects of surname origins. By constructing a conceptual graph centered around the core concept of surname etymology, we can identify meaningful expansions through hierarchical terms (broader concepts such as patronymic naming conventions), compositional terms (components like \"Robin\" itself), contextual terms (historical contexts where surnames were adopted in England), and domain-specific terminology (terms commonly used in genealogy or linguistic studies). This approach ensures that the expanded query not only maintains but enhances the original search intent, leading to more precise retrieval of documents.",

  "thought_process": "As I delve into the task of expanding the query \"what is the origin of the name Robinson,\" my initial thoughts revolve around the concept of surnames and their etymology. This makes me think of the historical and linguistic contexts in which surnames were formed and evolved. Though the user might be trying to uncover the specific roots of the Robinson surname, it's also possible they're interested in the broader cultural and historical framework of surname adoption in England. \n\nTo systematically approach this, I'll utilize the query expansion technique via conceptual graph traversal. This involves identifying core concepts, constructing a conceptual graph, selecting expansion paths, extracting and filtering terms, and finally, formulating an augmented query. \n\nStarting with query analysis, the core concept here is clearly the \"origin of the name Robinson,\" with the implicit intent of understanding its etymology and historical context. The search intent is informational, aiming to provide detailed insights into the surname's roots.\n\nMoving on to graph construction, the core nodes include \"Robinson surname origin,\" \"patronymic naming convention,\" and \"English etymology.\" First-order connections would involve the relationship between Robinson and its patronymic origin, suggesting a connection to the given name \"Robin.\" Second-order connections might include broader concepts like \"Middle Ages English surnames\" and \"Anglo-Saxon naming practices,\" offering a richer historical context. Domain contexts would involve genealogy and heraldry, fields where the study of surnames is paramount.\n\nFor expansion path selection, I identify several promising directions: \n- Hierarchical terms, such as broader concepts related to surnames in general or narrower concepts focusing on specific aspects of patronymic naming.\n- Compositional terms, including the components of the surname \"Robinson,\" like \"Robin,\" and its suffix indicating \"son of.\"\n- Contextual terms, such as historical periods or geographical locations significant to the adoption and evolution of the surname.\n- Domain-specific terminology from genealogy and linguistic studies that could provide precise language for searching.\n\nExtracting and filtering terms based on their relevance, distinctiveness, specificity, and searchability, I consider terms like \"patronymic surname,\" \"English surname etymology,\" \"Medieval naming conventions,\" and \"Anglo-Saxon genealogy.\" These terms maintain a strong semantic connection to the original query while offering alternative pathways for document retrieval.\n\nSynthesizing this information, the expanded query becomes \"what is the origin of the name Robinson including patronymic naming conventions, Robin given name etymology, historical surname adoption in England.\" This approach ensures that the search results will not only cover the direct origins of the Robinson surname but also delve into its historical, cultural, and linguistic contexts, providing a comprehensive understanding of the surname's etymology.\n\nThrough this systematic yet intuitively guided process, the goal is to enhance the specificity and relevance of the search query, leading to more precise and informative results that fully address the user's informational needs.",
