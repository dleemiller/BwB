  "reasoning": "The query \"i will die to defend your right to say it\" aims to uncover information about the origins, context, or notable discussions related to a famous quote often misattributed to Voltaire regarding freedom of speech. The strengths include finding documents that provide historical accuracy and clarity on this quote. However, weaknesses arise from extraneous results such as song lyrics, personal accounts, and unrelated tributes which detract from the focused information desired. To enhance relevance, the search query should be refined by clarifying its goals, eliminating ineffective terms, and expanding both in breadth and depth to include related concepts like historical context, philosophical discussions on free speech, and notable figures or cases associated with this quote.",

  "thought_process": "As I delve into the query \"i will die to defend your right to say it,\" my initial impression is that this phrase is often associated with the concept of freedom of speech, although it's commonly misattributed to Voltaire. The user seems to be looking for information on the origins of this quote, its historical context, and perhaps discussions or cases related to freedom of expression. However, the query as it stands might yield results that are too broad or unrelated, such as song lyrics or personal statements, which wouldn't provide the depth of information the user is likely seeking.\n\nTo refine this query, I'll apply a structured approach using the expansion technique provided, which involves goal elucidation, identifying ineffective terms, breadth expansion, and depth expansion. This technique is particularly useful because it helps in systematically uncovering relevant information by clarifying the query's objectives, eliminating non-precise terms, and expanding the search to include related concepts and specific instances.\n\nFirst, let's elucidate the goals of the query. The user wants to identify the original source of the quote, explore historical contexts where similar sentiments were expressed, discuss notable individuals who championed freedom of expression, and understand legal interpretations and landmark cases involving free speech. This gives us a clear direction for our expansion.\n\nNext, we identify ineffective terms in the original query, which are \"i will die,\" \"to defend your right,\" and \"say it.\" These terms are too broad and might not lead to the specific information the user is looking for.\n\nFor breadth expansion, we consider terms that are related to the concept of freedom of speech, such as \"freedom of speech,\" \"Voltaire misquote,\" \"philosophical essays on liberty,\" \"historical defense of expression,\" and \"notable advocates for freedom of speech.\" These terms help us cast a wider net to capture more relevant information.\n\nNow, for depth expansion, let's choose a topic from our breadth expansion and dive deeper. A promising area is \"notable advocates for freedom of speech,\" such as John Stuart Mill, and then further exploring historic court cases on free speech like Brandenburg v. Ohio, and international declarations on expression rights including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This depth expansion allows us to find more specific and relevant information that aligns with the user's goals.\n\nAs I apply this technique, I notice that the process is not just about mechanically following steps, but also about making intuitive connections and reconsiderations. For instance, while exploring philosophical essays on liberty, I'm reminded of the importance of context in understanding the evolution of thoughts on freedom of speech, which leads me to consider historical periods of significant change or debate on these issues.\n\nThrough this structured yet flexible approach, I'm able to synthesize the information and identify key terms that would be effective for an expanded query. The terms need to be specific, diverse, and relevant, avoiding any logical operators and ensuring uniqueness and precision.\n\nConsidering the guidelines for the final output, I construct the augmented query by focusing on targeted expansions that introduce new dimensions to the query, applying varied augmentation techniques such as synonym replacement, conceptual expansion, and domain-specific terminology. The resulting query should contain high-quality search terms that are non-overlapping with the original query, relevant, and targeted towards depth expansion with additional high-relevance terms.\n\nThe final step is to ensure that the augmented query meets all the specified criteria: it should be novel, free from overlapping terms, specific, diverse, and relevant. By carefully selecting terms from the depth expansion and ensuring they are precise and unique, I can create an effective augmented query.",
