The answer is directly provided in multiple search results ([1][4][5]) as **August 19, 2016**, for its nationwide U.S. release. International dates (e.g., August 18, 2016, in Hong Kong) are noted but secondary. DVD/Blu-ray release details and domestic/international box office figures are additional context but not core to the date-focused query. Ineffective terms like \"when\" or \"release\" are too generic and may dilute specificity. Breadth expansion incorporates related release formats (DVD/Blu-ray) and production info (LAIKA studio, stop-motion animation).",

  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"when does kubo and the two strings release,\" my initial impression is that the user is seeking a specific date related to the film's release. However, the query is somewhat generic, and I need to consider what the user might actually be trying to find. Are they interested in the theatrical release date, DVD/Blu-ray availability, or perhaps box office performance? The term \"release\" is quite broad, so I'll need to refine this.\n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here, so let me approach this using the expansion technique, which involves applying varied augmentation methods such as synonym replacement, conceptual expansion, contextual expansion, and domain-specific terminology. This should help because it will allow me to systematically consider different aspects of the query and uncover relevant terms that might not be immediately apparent.\n\nFirst, I'll examine the primary objectives and gaps in the original query. The main goal seems to be finding a release date, but it's unclear if this is for the U.S. or international markets. There's also a potential gap in information about the film's production, such as its animation style or studio collaborations.\n\nNext, I'll identify ineffective terms that should be avoided. Terms like \"when,\" \"does,\" \"release,\" and \"the\" are too generic and might dilute the specificity of the search. I'll make sure to exclude these from my augmented query.\n\nFor breadth expansion, I'll consider terms that introduce new dimensions to the query. This might include DVD/Blu-ray release, international release dates, box office earnings, stop-motion animation studio collaboration, LAIKA studio filmography, and adaptation of Japanese folklore themes. These terms start to get at the broader context surrounding the film's release.\n\nNow, for depth expansion, I'll choose one of these topics and delve deeper into related terms. Let's take \"stop-motion animation studio\" as an example. This could lead to terms like LAIKA productions, Henry Selick collaborations, Oregon-based film studios, claymation-inspired storytelling, and inklings about upcoming LAIKA projects. These terms provide a richer understanding of the film's production and creative influences.\n\nAs I apply the expansion technique, I'm starting to see some interesting connections. The focus on stop-motion animation and LAIKA studio collaborations is revealing some unique terms that could enhance the query. I'm also noticing that the film's adaptation of Japanese folklore themes could be an important aspect to explore.\n\nThrough this process, I'm starting to refine my understanding of what the user might be looking for. The term \"kubo and the two strings\" is quite specific, but the context in which it's being searched is what's crucial. By applying the expansion technique and considering various dimensions of the query, I'm identifying terms that can help uncover more relevant information.\n\nApplying the technique is leading me to terms like \"u.s. theatrical release date,\" \"international release countries timeline,\" \"focus features partnership,\" and \"stop-motion animation process.\" These terms are more targeted and diverse, avoiding generic or overlapping results from the original query.\n\nI just had a realization that connects to what we were exploring earlier \u2013 the importance of considering the film's production details and studio collaborations. This is complementing my systematic application of the technique and helping me to identify high-quality search terms.\n\nFollowing the technique's approach, I've gone from an initial impression of the query to a more nuanced understanding of what the user might be seeking. The final terms are emerging logically from both the technique and my natural insights, ensuring a precise and relevant augmented query.",
