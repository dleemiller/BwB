  "thought_process": "As I delve into the query \"where is Dia de los Muertos celebrated in Mexico,\" my initial thoughts revolve around the cultural and geographical aspects of this significant holiday. It makes me think of the rich cultural heritage of Mexico, the blending of indigenous and Catholic traditions, and the various regional celebrations that must exist across the country. The user might be looking for specific locations, but they could also be interested in the cultural context and significance of these celebrations.\n\nTo expand this query effectively, I'm going to employ a structured approach using the multi-disciplinary expert panel technique. This involves gathering insights from diverse fields such as cultural geography, anthropology, history, tourism, and sociology. By doing so, we can uncover deeper and more specific understandings of how Dia de los Muertos is observed across different regions in Mexico.\n\nStarting with the experts' individual consultations, I consider the geographical influence on celebrations, noting that central and southern Mexico, with their strong indigenous roots, are likely to have unique and vibrant festivities. The anthropological perspective highlights the importance of traditional rituals in specific communities, such as those found in Oaxaca and Michoac\u00e1n. Historical insights reveal the impact of Spanish colonization on the blending of Catholic and indigenous customs, particularly evident in regions like Guanajuato. From a tourism standpoint, popular destinations for these celebrations, such as P\u00e1tzcuaro and Xochimilco, offer a glimpse into how these events are both preserved and presented to outsiders. Lastly, sociological analysis underscores the role of these festivals in reinforcing local identity and community bonds.\n\nAs I bring these experts together in a panel discussion, interesting cross-connections emerge. The historical colonization of Mexico by Spain not only introduced Catholic elements into the celebration but also influenced the geographical distribution of these practices. The impact of migration patterns on the cultural geography of celebrations becomes apparent, with urban versus rural festivities varying significantly. Furthermore, the discussion touches on how tourism can both preserve traditional customs and risk commodifying cultural elements, a delicate balance that communities must navigate.\n\nFrom these insights, several key terms and concepts emerge that can enrich our original query. Terms like \"cultural geography,\" \"indigenous customs,\" \"Catholic syncretism,\" \"ofrendas (altars),\" and \"community identity\" offer a nuanced understanding of the celebrations. Specific locations such as Oaxaca, Michoac\u00e1n, Guanajuato, P\u00e1tzcuaro, Xochimilco, and Jalisco are identified as significant sites for these festivities.\n\nBy synthesizing these expert insights, I can construct an augmented query that not only seeks locations but also delves into the cultural, historical, and social context of Dia de los Muertos celebrations in Mexico. The expanded query becomes: \"Where is Dia de los Muertos celebrated in Mexico, particularly focusing on regional variations and cultural influences in central and southern Mexico, such as Oaxaca, Michoac\u00e1n, Guanajuato, P\u00e1tzcuaro, Xochimilco, and Jalisco?\"\n\nThis approach ensures that the search query captures both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, providing a comprehensive exploration of Dia de los Muertos in Mexico. Through this systematic application of the multi-disciplinary expert panel technique, intertwined with natural thought patterns and intuitive leaps, we can uncover a deeper understanding of this significant cultural phenomenon.",
