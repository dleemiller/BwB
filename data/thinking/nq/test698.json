  "reasoning": "The query \"the 100 what did clarke do to be in jail\" indicates a user seeking specific information about Clarke Griffin's storyline involving her imprisonment in the TV series \"The 100.\" The documents retrieved were largely irrelevant, with only one directly related to Clarke's situation.

Map their information journeys from initial inquiry to deeper understanding.\n4. Consider various contexts where users might seek this information, such as for entertainment discussion or academic analysis.\n5. Extract intent-based terms that encapsulate diverse user needs throughout these processes.\n\nThis method ensures a holistic approach, enhancing the specificity and relevance of search results by addressing both broad and niche aspects of the query context.",

  "thought_process": "As I delve into the query \"the 100 what did clarke do to be in jail,\" my initial thought is that this user is seeking a very specific piece of information from the TV series \"The 100.\" The mention of Clarke and her imprisonment immediately suggests a storyline from the show, but the user's phrasing indicates they might not be familiar with the intricacies of the plot or perhaps are looking for a refresher. This makes me think about how different users, with varying levels of engagement and knowledge about the series, might approach finding this information.\n\nLet's consider the novice fan, for instance, who watches \"The 100\" casually. They might start with broad queries like \"What happens to Clarke in The 100?\" or \"Clarke Griffin storyline,\" reflecting their general interest but lack of specific details. In contrast, an advanced enthusiast or an expert analyst would likely use more precise language, such as \"Detailed plot of Clarke's imprisonment\" or \"Character analysis: Clarke Griffin\u2019s motivations and consequences.\" This variety in search vocabulary highlights the importance of understanding the user's intent and expertise level when expanding the query.\n\nTo systematically approach this query expansion, I will use the technique of user intent and journey mapping. This involves creating user personas, analyzing their search vocabulary, mapping their information journey, considering various contextual scenarios, and finally, extracting intent-based terms. By doing so, we can ensure that the expanded query captures the essence of what the user is seeking, regardless of their background or the stage of their information journey.\n\nStarting with user personas, we have the novice fan, the intermediate fan, the advanced enthusiast, and the expert analyst. Each of these personas would approach the search with different prior knowledge, goals, and vocabulary. For example, a novice might begin with \"What is Clarke Griffin's storyline in The 100?\" whereas an expert analyst might search for \"Thematic significance of Clarke Griffin\u2019s imprisonment in The 100.\" This range of search terms already suggests that our expanded query needs to be comprehensive, covering both general plot inquiries and deeper thematic analyses.\n\nAs I proceed with the expansion technique, I find myself applying each step systematically but also allowing for natural cognitive elements to influence the process. For instance, considering the user personas leads me to think about how their information needs change as they progress from casual interest to in-depth analysis. This, in turn, reminds me of the importance of including terms that reflect both the plot-specific and thematic aspects of Clarke's storyline.\n\nThe journey mapping stage is particularly insightful, as it reveals how users' search terms evolve. Initially, they might focus on basic plot understanding, such as \"Why is Clarke in jail?\" Later, they could seek episode-specific details or explore the motivations behind Clarke's actions. This progression indicates that our expanded query should not only include terms like \"Clarke Griffin jail time\" but also \"character development\" and \"thematic analysis.\"\n\nOccasionally, I find myself taking a step back to reassess the query expansion process. It's during these moments that I realize the value of combining structured techniques with intuitive insights. For example, recognizing that users might discuss Clarke's storyline in fan forums or analyze it for academic purposes suggests incorporating terms that reflect these contexts, such as \"fan discussion\" or \"narrative analysis.\"\n\nThrough this systematic yet flexible approach, I begin to see the emergence of a cohesive set of terms that can effectively expand the original query. Terms like \"Clarke Griffin,\" \"jail time in The 100,\" \"character motivation,\" and \"thematic significance\" start to stand out as crucial components of the expanded query. These terms capture not just the explicit information about Clarke's imprisonment but also the implicit aspects of user intent, such as understanding the character's development or the thematic resonance of her storyline.\n\nIn synthesizing these insights, I conclude that the expanded query should indeed reflect the comprehensive nature of the users' information journey. By incorporating terms that address both the specific plot points and the broader thematic analyses, we can ensure that the search results are relevant and useful to a wide range of users.\n\nThus, through the application of the query expansion technique, combined with an understanding of user intent and journey mapping, I arrive at a thought process that is both structured and intuitively guided. This approach allows me to capture the complexity of the user's search query and expand it in a way that is logical, comprehensive, and reflective of real-world information-seeking behaviors.\n\nThe final expanded query, \"Clarke Griffin jail time storyline 'The 100' character motivation and episode details thematic analysis,\" emerges from this process as a culmination of understanding user personas, analyzing search vocabulary, mapping information journeys, considering contextual scenarios, and extracting intent-based terms. It represents a balanced approach, blending the systematic application of the expansion technique with the natural cognitive patterns that reflect how users think and seek information.",
