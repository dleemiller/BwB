  "thought_process": "As I delve into the query \"who did the Assyrians conquer in 722 BCE,\" my initial impressions lead me to think about the significant historical events of that time, particularly the fall of the Kingdom of Israel. Though the user might be looking for a straightforward answer, I sense there's more depth to explore, considering the broader implications of this conquest on the ancient Near Eastern geopolitical landscape.\n\nTo systematically approach this, I'll employ the technique of Conceptual Territory Mapping, which involves charting the central coordinates, exploring boundaries, identifying landmarks, mapping details, and creating a cartographic legend. This structured approach will help uncover the intricacies of the Assyrian conquests and their impact.\n\nStarting with the central coordinates, I focus on the Assyrian Empire's campaign against the Kingdom of Israel, culminating in the conquest of Samaria in 722 BCE. The cardinal directions involve understanding both the historical context and the theoretical interpretations of this event by historians. Scaling the inquiry to balance granular details with broader implications is crucial; it's not just about the event itself but also its repercussions on regional power dynamics and cultural developments.\n\nAs I explore the boundaries of this query, I notice the immediate territory encompasses ancient Near Eastern history, with neighboring domains including the political histories of Judah, Egypt, and the broader themes of imperialism and cultural assimilation. There's an overlap with biblical historiography, given the significance of these events in religious texts.\n\nIdentifying landmarks within this territory, the fall of Samaria, the deportation of the Ten Tribes, and the role of King Sargon II stand out. These are pivotal not just for understanding the Assyrian Empire's expansion but also for grasping the complexities of managing conquered territories and the impact on local populations.\n\nIn detailing the map, features such as the political structure of the Kingdom of Israel before its fall, the military tactics employed by the Assyrians, and the archaeological evidence supporting historical accounts become important. These specifics help in navigating the complex historical narrative and provide a richer understanding of the events leading to and following the conquest.\n\nCreating a cartographic legend involves isolating key terms that serve as navigational aids: \"Assyrian Empire,\" \"Kingdom of Israel,\" \"Samaria,\" \"Sargon II,\" \"Ten Tribes,\" \"Neo-Assyrian conquests,\" and \"deportation policy.\" These terms are essential for exploring the conceptual territory and uncovering related insights.\n\nThrough this process, applying the Conceptual Territory Mapping technique not only leads to a more comprehensive understanding of the Assyrian conquest of the Kingdom of Israel in 722 BCE but also illuminates the broader historical and cultural context. The structured approach complements my natural thought patterns, allowing for a systematic exploration while remaining open to intuitive connections and insights that emerge from the process.\n\nThe final augmented query, \"Assyrian conquest of Samaria 722 BCE, Kingdom of Israel fall, Sargon II military campaign, Ten Tribes deportation,\" encapsulates the core elements of this historical event, serving as a foundation for further research and exploration into the intricacies of ancient Near Eastern history and the Assyrian Empire's conquests.",
