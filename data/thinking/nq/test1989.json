  "reasoning": "The primary objective of the original query is to identify the product formed when krypton-85 undergoes beta decay, which involves understanding nuclear transformation. However, there are gaps in providing additional context about applications or broader implications beyond merely stating the decay product. The current search results mainly focus on scientific and technical aspects without expanding into related domains like practical uses of rubidium-85 or broader applications in technology. By identifying ineffective terms from the query that lead to non-specific results, we can redirect focus towards specific expansions that would yield richer contextual insights. Breadth expansion will introduce new dimensions such as related elements or processes, while depth expansion delves into significant aspects like practical applications of the decay product.",

  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query about krypton-85 decaying by emission of a beta particle, this makes me think of nuclear transformations and the potential applications of the decay product, rubidium-85. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the scientific process, I'm also considering that they might be interested in broader implications or uses of this decay in various fields. The existing reasoning provides a good foundation, highlighting the need to move beyond mere technical aspects and into practical applications or related domains.\n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here, but to structure my approach, I'll use the expansion technique provided, which involves identifying ineffective terms, applying breadth and depth expansions, and finally, synthesizing the findings into an augmented query. This technique should help because it systematically guides the exploration of relevant terms while allowing for the introduction of new, diverse concepts.\n\nFirst, let's examine the original query to understand its primary objectives and gaps. The main goal is to identify the product of krypton-85's beta decay, which is straightforward from a scientific standpoint. However, the query lacks depth in terms of applications or broader nuclear transformation processes. The ineffective terms identified, such as \"decays,\" \"emission,\" and \"particle,\" are too broad and don't lead to specific, useful results.\n\nFor breadth expansion, terms like \"rubidium applications,\" \"radioactive decay usage,\" \"beta emission energy utilization,\" \"nuclear medicine applications,\" and \"isotope tracing techniques\" introduce new dimensions. These terms start to unveil the practical and scientific implications of the decay product, moving beyond the mere fact of the decay.\n\nDelving deeper into one of these areas, such as nuclear medicine, reveals a rich field of application. The depth chain from nuclear medicine to diagnostic imaging, radiopharmaceuticals, gamma cameras, and MRI contrast agents shows how the initial query can lead to very specific and useful information. This depth expansion provides a clear pathway to understanding the broader implications and applications of the original query.\n\nThrough this process, applying the expansion technique and exploring related threads, I believe the terms that would be most effective for an augmented query are those that capture both the scientific and practical aspects of the user's inquiry. The final augmented query should include terms from the depth expansion, ensuring relevance and specificity.\n\nThe augmented query process has led to the identification of high-quality search terms that are diverse, relevant, and targeted. By avoiding logical operators, ensuring uniqueness, and focusing on precision, the resulting query is designed to yield non-overlapping results from the original query, providing a richer context for understanding the decay of krypton-85 and its applications.",
