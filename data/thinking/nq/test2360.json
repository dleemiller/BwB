  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query \"where was the diary of a wimpy kid filmed,\" this makes me think of the various locations that could have been used for the movies in the franchise. Though the user might actually be trying to find specific details about the production, like which studios were involved or if any local landmarks were featured, it seems like they're mostly interested in the geographical aspect of filming. Hmm, not sure yet how to balance the need for specific locations with the broader context of film production.\n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here, and to tackle this, I'll approach it using the technique of query expansion through a combination of synonym replacement, conceptual expansion, and domain-specific terminology. This should help because it allows for a systematic exploration of related concepts while avoiding overly broad or non-precise terms that don't add much value to the search.\n\nFirst, let's consider the ineffective terms that should be avoided. Terms like \"where,\" \"was,\" \"the,\" \"of,\" and \"a\" are too generic and won't help in narrowing down the search to specific filming locations or production details. Following the expansion technique, I should start by identifying the different movies in the franchise and their potential filming areas. This leads me to think about the first movie, the second movie, the third movie, and even the animated movie, as each might have had different filming locations.\n\nNow, let's broaden the query by introducing terms that are increasingly distant but still relevant to the original query. Terms like \"Vancouver,\" \"Atlanta,\" \"filming schedule,\" \"production design,\" \"on location,\" and \"studio sets\" start to give us a clearer picture of what the user might be looking for. The mention of Vancouver, for instance, reminds me of the British Columbia film industry and specific filming locations like Riverview Hospital, North Shore Studios, Burnaby Village Museum, and Steveston Fisherman\u2019s Wharf. These are great examples of how the technique can help uncover specific, relevant details.\n\nHowever, to truly enhance the query, we need to go deeper into one of these areas. Let's choose Vancouver as our focal point. By delving deeper into the British Columbia film industry, we find terms like \"Riverview Hospital filming,\" \"North Shore Studios,\" \"Burnaby Village Museum movie sets,\" \"Steveston Fisherman\u2019s Wharf,\" and \"Vancouver Film School.\" These terms not only provide specific locations but also touch on the aspect of film production, such as studio sets and on-location filming.\n\nAs I apply the technique, I notice that it's not just about accumulating terms but also about understanding how they relate to each other and to the user's original question. For example, knowing that Riverview Hospital was used as a filming location tells us something about the production design and the decision to use existing locations rather than building sets. This realization connects back to the broader goals of identifying specific filming locations and understanding the production process.\n\nThe process of applying this technique and exploring related threads leads me to believe that terms like \"Riverview Hospital,\" \"North Shore Studios,\" \"Burnaby Village Museum,\" \"Steveston Fisherman\u2019s Wharf,\" \"Vancouver Film School,\" \"British Columbia film industry,\" \"Atlanta,\" \"filming schedule,\" \"production design,\" \"on location,\" and \"studio sets\" would be highly effective for a BM25 index. They capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, from specific locations to the nuances of film production.\n\nThrough this systematic approach combined with natural cognitive patterns, such as making connections between seemingly unrelated concepts and reconsidering initial assumptions, we've managed to craft a query that is both targeted and diverse. It avoids generic terms while introducing new dimensions to the search, enhancing the likelihood of finding relevant and non-overlapping results.",
