  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"where did they film Woody the Woodpecker movie,\" this immediately makes me think of classic cartoon settings and the possible locations that could have been used for filming. Though the user might actually be trying to find out more about the production process or the specific studios involved, I'm not sure yet. My initial impression is to consider the iconic scenes from Woody Woodpecker cartoons and how they might relate to real-world locations. However, to expand this query effectively, I need to approach it systematically.\n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here, so let me approach this using the \"Query Expansion via Multi-Disciplinary Expert Panel\" technique, which involves gathering insights from various fields of expertise. This should help because it allows us to cover more ground, from the technical aspects of film production to the cultural context in which these cartoons were created.\n\nFollowing the expert panel approach, I first consider the film production aspect. This leads me to think about studio backlots and the specific studios that might have been involved in producing Woody Woodpecker films, such as Universal Studios or Columbia Pictures. Wait, that's not quite right for this query; I need to consider not just the studios but also the geographical locations that might have been used for filming. Let me adjust my thinking to include geographical analysis.\n\nThe geography analyst's insight into using digital archives and geographic databases to map historic film locations is particularly useful. This step of the technique is revealing the importance of understanding urban development patterns at the time of filming and how studios might have chosen locations based on accessibility and the availability of certain landscapes or settings. This actually reminds me of the cultural studies specialist's point about cultural events or themed parks, which could provide alternative insights into location choices reflecting broader cultural trends.\n\nAs I apply the technique further, considering the animation historian's perspective on the evolution of animation techniques, I realize that transitions from classic to modern animation could have significantly influenced production settings. For instance, the shift towards more realistic backgrounds or the use of specific animation styles might have necessitated filming in different locations or the creation of more elaborate sets.\n\nI need to consider the next step in the technique, which involves synthesizing insights from different experts. However, I'm also noticing this interesting pattern where the technological advancements in animation directly impacted not only the filming techniques but also the choice of locations. This connection between animation history and media research suggests that by looking at press releases or media coverage from the time of a film's release, we might uncover references to filming locations that weren't immediately apparent.\n\nThrough this process of applying the multi-disciplinary expert panel technique and exploring related threads, I believe the expanded query should include terms that capture the essence of both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking. The terms should reflect the combination of studio practices, geographical locations, cultural influences, and technological advancements in animation. \n\nThus, the key terms to focus on would include \"studio backlots,\" \"production notes,\" \"Universal Studios Archives,\" \"Columbia Pictures,\" \"cultural events,\" \"GIS tools,\" \"urban development,\" \"animation techniques,\" \"classic vs. modern animation,\" \"press releases,\" and \"media coverage.\" These terms, derived from the insights of various experts, should provide a comprehensive basis for exploring the filming locations of Woody Woodpecker movies.\n\nThe final expanded query, therefore, becomes: \"Where were Woody Woodpecker movies filmed? Explore Universal Studios and Columbia Pictures archives, historical GIS data on urban film locations, production notes on studio backlots, cultural influences in filming choices, transitions in animation techniques, media reports from the time of release.\" This query synthesizes the structured approach with natural cognitive patterns, ensuring that the search covers both the technical and cultural aspects of the Woody Woodpecker films' production.",
