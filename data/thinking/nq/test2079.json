  "reasoning": "The query aims to identify the main artist of the song 'Somebody's Watching Me' while recognizing Michael Jackson's contribution. The current search results mix relevant details with unrelated information about other Michael Jackson projects, diluting the focus needed for this specific query. To improve relevance, it is necessary to hone in on terms and contexts that connect more directly to music collaboration without general or unrelated elements pertaining to Michael Jackson alone. By refining ineffective terms, expanding the breadth of related concepts, and delving deeper into one selected path (depth chain), a new set of focused search terms can be established to better target results within the domains of music discographies and collaborations.",

  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"who sings somebody's watching me with michael jackson,\" this makes me think of music collaborations and the complexities of searching for specific artists within a vast array of musical works. The user is clearly trying to identify the primary artist of the song \"Somebody's Watching Me\" while also acknowledging Michael Jackson's contribution. However, the inclusion of Michael Jackson might overwhelm the search results with his extensive solo work, diluting the focus on the specific collaboration in question.\n\nTo approach this, I'm seeing several possibilities, but let me structure my thinking using the technique of query expansion, which involves identifying ineffective terms, expanding the breadth of related concepts, and then delving deeper into one selected path for more specific details. This technique should help me refine the search terms to better target documents related to music collaborations, specifically focusing on the interactions between different artists and their contributions to particular songs.\n\nStarting with the original query, the ineffective term that stands out is \"Michael Jackson\" because, while relevant, it's too broad and could lead to a plethora of unrelated search results about his solo work. The goal is to identify the primary artist, which is Rockwell, and highlight Michael Jackson's specific contributions to \"Somebody's Watching Me.\"\n\nFor breadth expansion, I consider terms like \"duet,\" \"vocal feature,\" \"guest appearance,\" \"1980s pop music collaborations,\" \"production credits,\" and \"music video contributions.\" These terms introduce the concept of musical collaborations and are diverse enough to capture various aspects of how artists work together on songs.\n\nNext, for depth expansion, I choose \"production credits\" as the topic to delve deeper into. This leads to related terms such as \"songwriting collaborations,\" \"recording session details,\" \"studio musicians in pop songs,\" and \"vocal production techniques.\" These terms are more specific and targeted towards understanding the behind-the-scenes aspects of music production, which can provide valuable insights into the collaborative efforts behind \"Somebody's Watching Me.\"\n\nAs I apply this structured approach, I also allow for natural cognitive elements to influence my thinking. For instance, considering the term \"production credits\" reminds me of the importance of songwriting collaborations and the roles that different musicians play in the recording process. This intuitive connection highlights the value of exploring the specific contributions of each artist involved in a collaboration.\n\nThrough this process, insights begin to emerge from both the structured technique and my natural thought patterns. Applying the depth expansion technique leads to the discovery of specific terms like \"guest vocals,\" \"production credits,\" and \"studio sessions,\" which are directly relevant to understanding the collaboration on \"Somebody's Watching Me.\" Meanwhile, my instinct to consider the broader context of 1980s pop music collaborations provides a richer backdrop against which to understand the significance of this particular song.\n\nSynthesizing these thoughts with clarity, I conclude that the most effective search terms for targeting relevant documents about the song \"Somebody's Watching Me\" and its collaboration would include \"Rockwell,\" \"Somebody's Watching Me,\" \"guest vocals,\" \"production,\" \"1980s duets,\" \"music video collaboration,\" and \"studio sessions.\" These terms capture the essence of the query, focusing on the primary artist, the specific collaboration with Michael Jackson, and the context of musical production and collaboration in the 1980s.\n\nTherefore, the augmented query that emerges from this thought process is: Rockwell Somebody's Watching Me guest vocals production 1980s duets music video collaboration studio sessions vocal producers.",
