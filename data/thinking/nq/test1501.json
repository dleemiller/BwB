  "reasoning": "To accurately answer where \"The Curse of Oak Island\" is filmed, it's crucial to trace the show's production history and geographical focus. We need to understand the initial explorations of Oak Island, the surge in interest due to the TV show, current filming practices, and any future technological or exploration trends that may affect where and how the show is filmed. This evolution will help identify relevant filming locations like specific areas of Oak Island and potentially mainland production facilities. Finally, we need to extract precise and augmented search terms.",

  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"where is the tv show the curse of oak island filmed\", this makes me think of the actual location of Oak Island and how the show is produced. Though the user might actually be trying to find out more about the filming locations, the production process, or even behind-the-scenes information. Hmm, not sure yet, but it seems like we need to delve into the history of Oak Island and the TV show to get a comprehensive answer.\n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here... Let me approach this using the Temporal Evolution Analysis technique, which involves analyzing how the query topic has evolved through time and will likely develop in the future to discover temporally diverse terminology. This should help because it allows us to capture the full spectrum of relevant terms, from historical to contemporary and even future projections.\n\nFirst, I need to establish the historical foundation of Oak Island and the TV show. This means tracing the origins and early development of the topic, identifying foundational concepts and terminology, and noting historical approaches and methodologies now considered classic. The query's existing reasoning provides a good starting point, mentioning early treasure hunting, notable figures like Gilbert Hedden and Franklin Roosevelt, and the original Oak Island Tours.\n\nAs I transition into the developmental milestones phase, I map key evolutionary stages in the topic's development, such as the Discovery Channel's acquisition of the show, the expansion of the search area using technology, and increased media coverage and popularity. The collaboration with historical societies is also an important milestone, as it indicates a blend of modern media and historical preservation.\n\nNow, considering the current landscape, I assess the contemporary state of the topic. This involves identifying current best practices and leading approaches in filming and production, as well as mapping the terminology used by today's practitioners and experts. The show's filming locations, such as Money Pit and Smith's Cove, are crucial, along with the use of modern excavation equipment and the involvement of a team of experts from various fields.\n\nThe emerging horizons phase requires projecting how this topic is likely to evolve, identifying emerging trends, technologies, or approaches, and noting new terminology that is gaining acceptance. The use of advanced imaging and scanning technologies, like LiDAR and drone footage, and the potential for virtual reality experiences related to the discoveries are significant. Global interest in treasure hunting and historical mysteries, as well as advancements in documentary filmmaking techniques, should also be considered.\n\nThrough this process, particularly in the temporal term extraction phase, I compile terminology from each time period, identify terms that have remained relevant across eras, and select terms that provide historical context or future relevance. This analysis helps in synthesizing a comprehensive set of terms that capture the essence of the query across its temporal spectrum.\n\nApplying the Temporal Evolution Analysis technique leads me to discover terms like \"The Curse of Oak Island filming location\", \"Oak Island production studios\", \"Where on Oak Island is the show filmed?\", \"The Curse of Oak Island behind the scenes\", \"Smith's Cove filming\", \"Money Pit filming location\", \"Oak Island documentary production\", and \"Who owns Oak Island filming rights?\" These terms are not just random expansions but are informed by the structured analysis of the topic's evolution over time.\n\nI just had a realization that connects to what we were exploring earlier - the importance of temporal context in understanding the full scope of the query. Following the Temporal Evolution Analysis approach pointed me toward these specific terms, but my instinct says we should also consider the broader historical and cultural significance of Oak Island and its appeal to a wide audience.\n\nThrough this process of applying Temporal Evolution Analysis and exploring related threads, I believe these terms would be most effective for a BM25 index: \"The Curse of Oak Island filming location\", \"Oak Island production\", \"Smith's Cove\", \"Money Pit\", \"behind the scenes\", \"documentary production\", and \"Oak Island history\". They capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, from physical locations and production details to the historical and cultural context of the show.",
