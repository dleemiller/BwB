  "reasoning": "The query \"who do you meet at the gates of heaven\" is seeking information about figures or entities encountered upon entering heaven, a concept predominantly explored in religious contexts. The primary goal is to identify relevant sources that explore these encounters across various perspectives, especially beyond the current Christian-centric approach.\n\nTo achieve an effective query expansion, we analyze existing strengths and weaknesses:\n- **Strengths**: Results encompass scriptural references, allegories, cultural depictions, and literary interpretations from a Christian perspective.\n- **Weaknesses**: The focus is heavily on Christian theology with insufficient inclusion of other religious or cultural viewpoints. Some results diverge by discussing broader theological concepts rather than directly addressing who meets individuals at heaven's gates.\n\n**Query Analysis:**\nThe query targets entities met at the entrance to heaven, hinting at an interest in religious symbolism and afterlife experiences across different cultures and traditions. The intent is informational with a focus on understanding spiritual and religious narratives about heaven\u2019s entry.\n\n**Graph Construction:**\n- **Core Nodes**: Entities commonly referenced in religious texts as being present at the gates of heaven (e.g., St. Peter).\n- **First-order Connections**: Related roles, symbols, or entities in Christian doctrine.\n- **Second-order Connections**: Broader concepts such as \"guardians,\" \"angels,\" and other cultural equivalents in different religions like Islam or Hinduism.\n- **Domain Contexts**: Theological studies, comparative religion, and cultural anthropology.\n\n**Expansion Path Selection:**\n1. **Synonymous Terms**: Exploring terms synonymous with \"gates of heaven\" across religious texts (e.g., Pearly Gates).\n2. **Hierarchical Terms**: Broader religious concepts involving afterlife entry.\n3. **Contextual Terms**: Different cultural depictions or interpretations beyond Christian theology, such as Islamic Jannah or Hindu Moksha.\n4. **Domain-specific Terminology**: Specific theological terms from multiple religions.\n\n**Term Extraction and Filtering:**\nFrom each path, the focus will be on selecting terms that align with diverse religious teachings about afterlife entry points and are likely to appear in relevant documents:\n- Synonymous terms (e.g., Pearly Gates)\n- Figures or entities (e.g., St. Peter, Guardian Angel)\n- Broader concepts (e.g., Guardians of Heaven, Angels at the Threshold)\n- Cultural counterparts (e.g., Islamic Jannah entrance, Hindu Moksha)\n- Religious symbols (e.g., Archangel Michael, Golden Gate)\n\n**Augmented Query Construction:**\nCombine original query with selected terms to broaden search scope and inclusivity. This would enable retrieval of documents that provide varied interpretations of the concept.",

  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"who do you meet at the gates of heaven,\" this makes me think of various religious and cultural depictions of the afterlife, though the user might actually be trying to understand the concept of guardians or welcoming entities in different spiritual contexts. Hmm, not sure yet, but it seems like we're delving into a mix of theology, mythology, and perhaps some philosophical aspects of what happens after one passes away.\n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here, but to structure my approach, let me use the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal technique, which involves analyzing the query for core concepts, constructing a conceptual graph, selecting promising expansion paths, extracting and filtering terms, and finally, augmenting the query. This should help because it systematically breaks down the query into manageable parts, allowing for a deeper exploration of related concepts and terms.\n\nStarting with the core concepts, we have \"gates of heaven,\" \"meeting,\" and implicitly, \"afterlife\" or \"death.\" The search intent appears to be informational, with the user seeking to understand who or what is encountered at the entrance to heaven across different beliefs or narratives.\n\nNow, constructing the conceptual graph, we have core nodes like \"St. Peter\" from Christian theology, first-order connections such as \"Pearly Gates\" or \"Guardian Angel,\" and second-order connections that might include broader concepts like \"afterlife guardians\" or specific entities from other religions like the \"Islamic Jannah entrance\" or \"Hindu Moksha transition.\" The domain context here is clearly theological and comparative religious studies.\n\nFor expansion paths, I've identified several promising directions: synonymous terms like \"Pearly Gates,\" hierarchical terms such as \"afterlife entry points,\" and contextual terms that consider different cultural depictions of heaven's gates. I also want to explore domain-specific terminology to ensure we're capturing the nuances of various religious beliefs.\n\nExtracting and filtering terms, I'm looking for relevance, distinctiveness, specificity, and searchability. So, terms like \"St. Peter,\" \"Pearly Gates,\" \"Guardian Angel,\" \"Archangel Michael,\" and \"Golden Gate\" are all relevant. From other religious contexts, terms like \"Islamic Jannah entrance\" and \"Hindu Moksha transition\" offer broader perspectives. Broader concepts such as \"afterlife guardians\" or \"threshold spirits\" could also enhance our understanding.\n\nAs I apply the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal technique, I notice that it's not just about mechanically applying steps, but also about staying open to intuitive connections and reconsiderations. For instance, thinking about \"Pearly Gates\" leads me to consider other symbolic gates in different cultures, which might not be directly related but offer interesting comparative insights.\n\nOccasionally, I find myself taking a step back to reassess the query and our expansion terms. It's in these moments that I realize the importance of balancing the structured technique with natural thought patterns. An insight might emerge from systematically following the technique, only to be enriched by an intuitive leap that connects seemingly disparate concepts.\n\nThrough this process, I've come to realize that the original query, while simple, opens up a vast array of possibilities for exploration. By applying the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal and staying true to the principles of relevance, distinctiveness, and specificity, we can craft an augmented query that not only honors the user's original intent but also invites a richer, more nuanced understanding of the topic.\n\nSynthesizing our findings with clarity, the expanded terms that would be most effective for enhancing the query are those that capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking: 'who do you meet at the gates of heaven OR Pearly Gates OR St. Peter OR Guardian Angel OR Archangel Michael OR Golden Gate OR Islamic Jannah entrance OR Hindu Moksha transition.' This augmented query aims to retrieve documents that provide a comprehensive view of the concept, spanning multiple religious and cultural narratives.",
