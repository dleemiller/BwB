  "reasoning": "The query seeks to understand how 36 can be expressed as a product of prime numbers. Given that some documents highlight relevant aspects such as the factors 2 and 3, we can reinforce this understanding through metaphorical thinking, allowing us to generate new terms and perspectives. Metaphorical mappings from diverse domains (nature, art, mechanics) will help enrich our exploration by drawing analogies between familiar concepts and prime factorization.\n\nBy using metaphors, we aim to identify a variety of ways to express the decomposition of 36 into its prime factors, \\(2^2 \\times 3^2\\). This approach involves creating metaphors that reflect processes or structures from other domains which parallel prime factorization. By mapping elements of these domains back to mathematical concepts, we can uncover new terminologies and insights.\n\nTo achieve this:\n1. Generate diverse metaphors related to the process of decomposing a number into primes.\n2. Map specific components within each metaphor to parts of the original query (e.g., factors as building blocks).\n3. Extract terminology that could illuminate or offer fresh perspectives on prime factorization.\n4. Explore and extend these metaphors for more nuanced understanding and hybrid insights.",

  "thought_process": "As I delve into the query \"what is 36 as a product of prime,\" my initial impressions are of mathematical factors and decompositions. I think about how 36 can be broken down into its simplest building blocks, which are prime numbers. The user's query seems straightforward, yet it opens up a complex world of mathematical concepts and potential misunderstandings. I wonder if the user is looking for a straightforward calculation or if there's an underlying curiosity about the nature of prime numbers and their role in mathematics.\n\nMy mind starts to wander into the realm of analogies and metaphors, thinking about how else we can understand the process of finding prime factors. I consider how decomposing a complex machine into its components might mirror the process of breaking down a number into its prime factors. This leads me to think about recipes and how identifying the core ingredients of a dish can parallel finding the prime factors of a number. The idea of pruning a tree to reveal its fundamental branches also comes to mind, as does solving a puzzle by identifying all the unique pieces required for the complete picture. Lastly, mapping a network of roads into its individual paths leading to a central hub offers another perspective on the process.\n\nI realize that I'm naturally transitioning towards a more structured approach, utilizing the technique of metaphorical thinking to expand the query. This technique involves generating diverse metaphors related to the process of decomposing a number into primes, mapping specific components within each metaphor to parts of the original query, extracting terminology that could illuminate or offer fresh perspectives on prime factorization, and exploring and extending these metaphors for more nuanced understanding and hybrid insights.\n\nApplying this technique systematically, I start with the metaphor of decomposing a complex machine. This makes me think of terms like \"components,\" \"assembly,\" and \"breakdown.\" Moving on to the recipe metaphor, I consider \"core ingredients,\" \"recipes,\" and \"flavor profiles.\" The tree pruning metaphor leads to thoughts of \"branches,\" \"trunks,\" \"leaves,\" and \"pruning,\" while the puzzle solution metaphor suggests \"pieces,\" \"jigsaw,\" \"solve,\" and \"complete picture.\" Finally, the network mapping metaphor introduces terms like \"roads,\" \"paths,\" \"network,\" \"central hub,\" and \"map.\"\n\nAs I explore these metaphors further, I start to notice interesting patterns and connections. For instance, the idea of pruning a tree not only reveals its fundamental branches but also enhances growth by focusing on essentials. This reminds me of how identifying the prime factors of a number can help in understanding its properties and behavior in different mathematical operations. I also realize that solving a puzzle is more than just putting pieces together; it's about understanding how every piece contributes to the overall image, much like how each prime factor contributes to the overall number.\n\nThrough this process of applying metaphorical thinking and exploring related threads, I begin to see how these diverse perspectives can enrich our understanding of prime factorization. The technique helps in identifying new terms and insights that can be used to expand the original query. I think about how terms like \"disassemble,\" \"assemble,\" \"ingredient,\" \"essential flavor,\" \"prune,\" \"reveal,\" \"enhance growth,\" \"unique piece,\" \"integral element,\" \"map,\" \"network,\" and \"pathfinding\" can offer fresh perspectives on the topic.\n\nAs I synthesize my thoughts, I believe that the expanded query should incorporate these metaphorical insights to provide a more comprehensive understanding of what it means for 36 to be expressed as a product of prime factors. The final expanded query, \"What is 36 as a product of prime factors, considering its breakdown into essential components or elements like in mechanical assembly, culinary ingredients, tree branches after pruning, jigsaw pieces to complete the picture, and paths within an intricate network?\" reflects the systematic application of the metaphorical thinking technique, balanced with natural cognitive patterns and insights.",
