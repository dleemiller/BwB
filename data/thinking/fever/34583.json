  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was a wrestler,\" my initial impression is that there's a significant factual error here. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart is widely known as a renowned composer and musician, not a wrestler. This makes me think that the user might actually be trying to learn more about Mozart's life, his musical compositions, or perhaps how he fits into the broader context of classical music and his contemporaries. However, the mention of wrestling seems out of place and likely a point of confusion.\n\nTo approach this query expansion systematically, I'll use the Conceptual Graph Traversal technique, which involves constructing a conceptual graph around the query and then traversing it to find relevant expansion terms. This technique should help because it allows for a structured exploration of related concepts and entities, which can uncover terms that are semantically relevant but not immediately apparent from the original query.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the query. The core concept here is \"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart,\" and the search intent appears to be informational, with the user seeking to learn more about Mozart. However, the query also contains an implicit assumption or error regarding Mozart being a wrestler, which we'll need to address by focusing on accurate and relevant information about his life and work.\n\nConstructing the conceptual graph, we start with core nodes like \"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart,\" \"Musician,\" \"Composer,\" and \"Classical Music.\" First-order connections include relationships like \"composed,\" \"contemporaries,\" and \"genre.\" Second-order connections might involve broader concepts like \"18th Century Music,\" \"Austrian Composers,\" or specific works like \"Requiem.\" Domain contexts include classical music, composition, and Austrian culture.\n\nFor expansion path selection, we can consider several directions:\n- Synonymous terms: Other titles or descriptors for Mozart, such as \"Maestro\" or \"Child Prodigy.\"\n- Hierarchical terms: Broader concepts like \"Classical Composers\" or narrower ones like \"Operatic Composers.\"\n- Compositional terms: Specific types of music Mozart composed, such as \"Symphonies\" or \"Operas.\"\n- Contextual terms: Historical periods, like \"Baroque\" or \"Classical Period,\" and geographical locations, such as \"Salzburg\" or \"Vienna.\"\n- Domain-specific terminology: Technical terms from music theory or composition that are relevant to Mozart's work.\n\nExtracting and filtering terms, we prioritize those that are most relevant, distinctive, specific, and searchable. For example, terms like \"composer,\" \"classical music,\" \"Austria,\" \"18th century,\" \"symphonies,\" \"operas,\" \"Joseph Haydn,\" and \"Ludwig van Beethoven\" emerge as highly relevant. These terms not only correct the factual error in the original query but also provide a rich context for learning more about Mozart.\n\nApplying the Conceptual Graph Traversal technique and balancing it with natural thought patterns and intuition, I notice that focusing on Mozart's musical contributions and his place within the classical music scene of his time yields a wealth of relevant information. This approach also naturally leads to considering his contemporaries and the broader musical landscape of the 18th century, providing a comprehensive view of Mozart's significance.\n\nThrough this process, insights emerge from both the structured technique and intuitive connections. For instance, recognizing Mozart's role in the transition from the Baroque to the Classical period in music history adds depth to our understanding of his compositions. Similarly, considering the social and cultural context in which he worked, including his relationships with other composers like Haydn and Salieri, offers a more nuanced view of his life and work.\n\nSynthesizing this information with clarity, I believe the following terms would be most effective for expanding the query: \"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart,\" \"classical music,\" \"composer,\" \"Austria,\" \"18th century,\" \"symphonies,\" \"operas,\" \"Joseph Haydn,\" \"Ludwig van Beethoven,\" \"classical composer,\" \"musical compositions,\" \"Salzburg,\" and \"Vienna.\" These terms capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, correcting the initial error and providing a solid foundation for exploring Mozart's life, work, and legacy.",
