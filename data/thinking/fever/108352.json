  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query about Nate Diaz declining to compete in World Extreme Cagefighting, this makes me think of the complexities involved in professional fighting contracts and the potential reasons a fighter might refuse to participate in a specific organization. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the nuances of fighter management and contract negotiations, there seems to be a gap in the current information regarding Diaz's statement and the specifics of his negotiations or lack thereof with the WEC.\n\nTo approach this, I'll use a query expansion technique that involves understanding the primary objectives of the query and identifying gaps in the current information. The technique includes examining ineffective terms that are too broad or non-precise, performing breadth expansion to introduce new dimensions to the query, and depth expansion to delve deeper into specific topics that emerge from the breadth expansion.\n\nStarting with goal elucidation and gap identification, it's clear the primary objective is to find evidence supporting or refuting Diaz's statement and to explore potential reasons behind his decision. The gaps include the lack of specific information on negotiations, contracts, and reasons for refusal.\n\nThe ineffective terms in this context are \"compete,\" \"World Extreme Cagefighting,\" and \"Nate Diaz\" themselves, as they are too broad and don't specifically address the negotiation or contract aspects. For breadth expansion, terms like \"MMA contracts,\" \"fighter negotiations,\" \"WEC history,\" \"UFC vs WEC,\" and \"fighter management\" can introduce new dimensions. These terms expand the query beyond the specific case of Nate Diaz and into the broader context of professional mixed martial arts fighting and organizational dynamics.\n\nFor depth expansion, focusing on \"fighter contracts\" seems promising. Delving deeper into this topic involves exploring \"contract clauses,\" \"promotion exclusivity,\" \"salary disputes,\" and \"fighter walkouts.\" These terms directly address potential reasons for a fighter's refusal to compete in a particular organization and offer a pathway to understanding the complexities of professional fighting contracts.\n\nApplying the technique systematically, I start by examining the broader context of MMA contracts and then narrow down to the specifics of contract clauses and promotion exclusivity. The consideration of salary disputes and fighter walkouts as related concepts reveals the multifaceted nature of the decision-making process for fighters like Nate Diaz. This structured approach complements my natural thought process, which occasionally veers into tangents like considering the historical context of the WEC and its significance in the evolution of MMA.\n\nHowever, staying focused on the task at hand, I recognize that the key to a successful query expansion lies in balancing structured technique with natural cognitive patterns. The systematic application of the depth expansion technique leads to the identification of high-quality search terms that are both relevant and diverse. Terms like \"contract clauses,\" \"promotion exclusivity,\" and \"fighter walkouts\" emerge as crucial for understanding the intricacies of fighter contracts and negotiations.\n\nThrough this process of applying the query expansion technique and exploring related threads, I believe the terms that would be most effective for further investigation are those that capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking. The final augmented query should reflect a balance between the structured approach and the natural insights gained from the expansion process.",
