  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"Physics' main goal is to understand the behavior of the universe,\" this makes me think of the broad scope of physics and how it encompasses various subfields, each with its unique contributions to understanding the universe. Though the user might actually be trying to explore specific aspects of physics, such as its applications or theoretical frameworks, the query's core intent seems to be about grasping the fundamental objectives of physics. \n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here, but to systematically expand this query, I'll approach it using the Conceptual Graph Traversal technique, which involves constructing a conceptual graph of the query's core concepts, entities, and their relationships, and then traversing this graph to identify relevant expansion terms. This should help because it allows for a structured exploration of the query's semantic space, potentially uncovering related terms and concepts that could enhance the search results.\n\nStarting with query analysis, the core concepts are \"physics\" and \"behavior of the universe.\" The search intent appears to be informational, aiming to understand the primary goals and possibly the scope of physics. Implicit assumptions might include the expectation that physics is a unified field with a coherent set of goals, though in reality, it's highly interdisciplinary and diverse.\n\nMoving to graph construction, the core nodes would be \"physics\" and \"universe.\" First-order connections could include subfields like \"cosmology,\" \"particle physics,\" and \"quantum mechanics,\" as well as key physicists who have significantly contributed to our understanding of the universe, such as \"Albert Einstein\" and \"Isaac Newton.\" Second-order connections might involve experimental methods (\"experimental physics\") and contemporary challenges (\"dark matter research\"). The domain context is clearly within the natural sciences, specifically physics.\n\nFor expansion path selection, promising directions seem to be:\n- Synonymous terms: Using terms like \"physical sciences\" or \"natural philosophy\" to capture a broader or slightly different perspective on physics.\n- Hierarchical terms: Both broader (like \"science\" or \"natural sciences\") and narrower terms (specific subfields of physics) could be useful.\n- Compositional terms: Looking into parts or components of physics, such as \"theoretical physics\" versus \"experimental physics.\"\n- Contextual terms: Considering the settings or applications of physics, like \"astrophysics\" for the study of celestial bodies or \"biophysics\" for the application of physics principles to biological systems.\n- Domain-specific terminology: Incorporating terms that are specifically used within the physics community, such as \"relativity,\" \"quantum mechanics,\" or \"entanglement.\"\n\nWhen extracting and filtering terms, relevance, distinctiveness, specificity, and searchability are key. For instance, terms like \"cosmology,\" \"quantum physics,\" and \"particle accelerator\" are relevant, distinct, and specific, and they are likely to appear in documents related to the core goals and subfields of physics.\n\nThrough this process of applying Conceptual Graph Traversal and exploring related threads, I believe the expanded terms that would be most effective for enhancing the query include \"physics subfields,\" \"key physicists,\" \"experiments in physics,\" \"challenges in physics,\" and \"behavior of the universe,\" alongside more specific terms like \"cosmology,\" \"particle physics,\" \"Einstein,\" \"Newton,\" \"experimental physics,\" and \"dark matter.\" These terms capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, providing a comprehensive foundation for a more detailed exploration of physics and its main goals.",
