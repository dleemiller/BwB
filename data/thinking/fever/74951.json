  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query \"Caesar is an original play by Orson Welles,\" this makes me think of Shakespeare's \"Julius Caesar\" and how Orson Welles might have adapted it. Though the user might actually be trying to find information about Welles's interpretation of the play, the current results are too broad, focusing on Welles's career rather than the play itself. \n\nAs I delve into the task, I start seeing several possibilities here. Let me approach this using the Expansion Technique, which involves examining the query's objectives, identifying ineffective terms, expanding the breadth of related concepts, and then diving deeper into one of these areas. This should help because it will allow me to systematically uncover more targeted and diverse terms related to the play.\n\nFirst, understanding the primary objectives of the query, it seems the user wants to find critical reviews of 'Caesar,' discover its historical context, and analyze its themes and character development. There are gaps in the current search results, as they don't specifically address these aspects. \n\nIdentifying ineffective terms, \"Orson Welles\" stands out because while relevant, it's too broad and leads to general biographical information rather than specifics about the play. \n\nFor breadth expansion, considering the original query and the objectives, terms like \"Shakespearean tragedy,\" \"adaptation,\" \"1940s theater,\" \"classical literature,\" and \"political commentary\" come to mind. These terms expand the query by introducing concepts related to the play's genre, its historical context, and its thematic elements.\n\nFollowing the Expansion Technique, for depth expansion, I choose \"political commentary\" as it's a crucial aspect of both Shakespeare's original play and potentially Welles's adaptation. Diving deeper, terms like \"ancient Roman history,\" \"Julius Caesar's legacy,\" \"power dynamics in leadership,\" and \"allegory and symbolism\" emerge. These terms not only provide a richer understanding of the play's context but also its thematic depth.\n\nApplying the Expansion Technique's steps systematically, I consider how each step reveals new insights. The breadth expansion helps to contextualize the play within its genre and time, while the depth expansion into \"political commentary\" and related terms like \"power dynamics\" and \"allegory\" offers a nuanced view of the play's themes.\n\nI had a realization that connects the play's historical context with its thematic elements, particularly how \"ancient Roman history\" and \"Julius Caesar's legacy\" inform the \"power dynamics in leadership\" portrayed in the play. This connection points towards the importance of \"allegory and symbolism\" in conveying these themes, suggesting that these elements are crucial for understanding the play's deeper meanings.\n\nThrough this process of applying the Expansion Technique and exploring related threads, I believe the terms \"ancient roman history,\" \"julius caesar,\" \"power dynamics,\" \"allegory,\" \"symbolism,\" and \"tragedy adaptation\" would be most effective for a targeted search. They capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, providing a balanced view of the play's context, themes, and significance.",
