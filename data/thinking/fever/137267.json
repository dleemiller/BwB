  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query \"Menace II Society is only set in 1970,\" this makes me think of the film's depiction of life in the inner city, though the user might actually be trying to understand the historical context or the social issues portrayed in the film. The existing reasoning suggests the user is looking for specific information about the time period, but the current results are too broad. To better address this, I'll use the expansion technique to discover new, relevant documents across various domains.\n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here, but let me approach this using the technique provided, which involves being specific and diverse, applying varied augmentation techniques such as synonym replacement, conceptual expansion, contextual expansion, and domain-specific terminology. This should help because it allows for a more nuanced and detailed exploration of the topic.\n\nStarting with goal elucidation and gaps, the primary objective seems to be identifying the time setting of the film \"Menace II Society\" and finding related cultural references from the 1970s. There's a gap in understanding the specific historical and social context that the film is set in.\n\nFor ineffective term identification, terms like \"only\" and \"is set in\" are too broad and don't add much value to the query. These should be avoided in the augmented query.\n\nMoving on to breadth expansion, terms like \"1970s culture,\" \"socioeconomic conditions,\" \"gang violence,\" \"youth subculture,\" and \"urban setting\" come to mind. These terms introduce new dimensions to the query and provide a starting point for deeper exploration.\n\nFor depth expansion, choosing \"1970s Los Angeles\" as a distant but important topic allows for a deeper dive into related terms such as \"ghetto life,\" \"Black Panther Party,\" \"Watts Riots,\" and \"police brutality.\" These terms not only provide context to the film's setting but also offer insights into the social and political climate of the time.\n\nApplying the technique systematically, I consider the steps involved in each task. However, I also find myself making intuitive connections and reconsidering certain terms. For instance, the term \"ghetto life\" reminds me of the broader concept of urban poverty, which could be an interesting aspect to explore further. Similarly, the mention of the \"Black Panther Party\" brings to mind the Civil Rights Movement and its impact on African American communities in the 1970s.\n\nAs I synthesize the information, I realize that the augmented query needs to capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking. The final terms should emerge logically from both the technique and natural insights. Through this process, I've identified key terms that are relevant, targeted, and diverse, ensuring the augmented query is novel and free from overlapping the original terms.",
