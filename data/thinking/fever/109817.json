  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"Louis Malle worked in a French industry,\" this makes me think of the film industry, given Louis Malle's prominence as a French film director. However, the user might actually be trying to explore other industries within France that Malle could have been involved in, or how his work intersects with various sectors beyond filmmaking. Hmm, not sure yet, but it seems like a fascinating exploration into the broader cultural and economic contexts of France during Malle's time.\n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here, but to approach this systematically, let me use the Conceptual Graph Traversal technique for query expansion. This technique involves constructing a conceptual graph based on the query and then traversing it to find relevant expansion terms. It should help because it allows us to systematically explore related concepts and entities that might not be immediately apparent from the original query.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the query. The core concepts here are \"Louis Malle,\" \"French,\" and \"industry.\" The search intent seems informational, aiming to discover more about Malle's involvement in French industries beyond perhaps the most obvious, film. There's an implicit assumption that Malle's work or influence extends into other sectors.\n\nNext, I'll construct the conceptual graph. The core nodes will be \"Louis Malle,\" \"French Industry,\" and potentially \"Film Director\" as a starting point. First-order connections could include \"New Wave Cinema,\" \"French Arts Scene,\" and \"European Film.\" Second-order connections might involve \"Luxury Goods,\" \"Fashion,\" \"Design,\" and \"Publishing,\" considering the broader cultural and economic landscape of France. Domain contexts could include \"Arts & Culture,\" \"Media,\" and \"Economy.\"\n\nFor expansion path selection, I identify several promising directions: synonymous terms like \"cinematography\" for film-related queries, hierarchical terms such as \"European Culture\" for broader context, compositional terms like \"photography\" which Malle was known for, contextual terms such as \"1960s Paris\" for a specific setting, and domain-specific terminology like \"auteur theory\" in film studies.\n\nNow, let's extract and filter terms for each path. For synonymous terms, \"film director\" and \"cinematographer\" could be relevant. Hierarchically, terms like \"European arts\" or \"Western culture\" might provide context. Compositionally, \"photography,\" \"screenplay writing,\" and \"film production\" are relevant. Contextually, \"post-war France,\" \"French New Wave,\" and \"art house cinema\" offer valuable insights. Domain-specific terms could include \"art cinema,\" \"film criticism,\" and \"cultural movements.\"\n\nFollowing the Conceptual Graph Traversal approach, I've identified a range of terms that can enhance our query. I just had a realization that connects to what we were exploring earlier - the intersection of Malle's work with the broader French cultural and economic landscape is rich with potential for discovery. Applying this technique has led me to terms like \"French New Wave,\" \"art house,\" \"European cinema,\" \"cultural movements,\" and \"luxury goods,\" which complement the original query nicely.\n\nThrough this process of applying Conceptual Graph Traversal and exploring related threads, I believe these terms would be most effective for expanding our query: \"Louis Malle,\" \"French,\" \"industry,\" \"film director,\" \"arts culture,\" \"media,\" \"photography,\" \"design,\" \"fashion,\" \"publishing,\" \"luxury goods,\" \"French New Wave,\" \"European cinema,\" \"art house,\" and \"cultural movements.\" They capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, providing a balanced approach to query expansion.",
