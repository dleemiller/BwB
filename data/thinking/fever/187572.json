  "thought_process": "As I delve into the query \"Dan Brown is an author,\" my initial impression is that the user is looking for more than just a biographical sketch. They're seeking an understanding of what makes Dan Brown's writing unique, the themes he explores, and perhaps even the controversies surrounding his work. This makes me think of the broader context of literary fiction, suspense, and the intersection of history and conspiracy theories. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the literary significance of Dan Brown or how his books have impacted popular culture, I'm not sure yet.\n\nTo expand on this query, I'll employ the \"Query Expansion Through Journalistic Investigation\" technique. This involves treating the query as a story and applying investigative research methods to uncover related terms and concepts. The first step is to assess what the user is truly seeking. Here, I identify assumptions about Dan Brown's genre, knowledge gaps about his literary influences, and unexpressed needs to understand the societal impact of his novels.\n\nNext, I consider real-world contexts where Dan Brown's work is relevant. Professionally, his influence can be seen in the thriller and suspense genres. Educationally, his books are often discussed in literature classes for their use of historical and symbolic elements. Personally, readers might be interested in how his stories reflect or challenge their beliefs about history, religion, and conspiracy theories. Specialized communities, such as book clubs or fan forums, also play a significant role in discussing and dissecting his work.\n\nNow, I move on to investigating resources. Notable experts in literary analysis, historians who have commented on the accuracy of Brown's historical references, and other authors in the suspense genre are all valuable sources. Established methodologies for analyzing literature, such as critical theory or hermeneutics, can provide frameworks for understanding Brown's narratives. Essential terminology includes literary terms like \"plot structure,\" \"character development,\" and \"symbolism,\" as well as historical and religious terms relevant to his stories.\n\nCreating headlines for articles about Dan Brown helps to extract specific terms and concepts. For example, \"Decoding Dan Brown: Uncovering the Literary Secrets Behind His Success,\" \"The Historical Fiction of Dan Brown: Accuracy and Artistic License,\" or \"Beyond the Code: Exploring the Philosophical Themes in Dan Brown's Novels.\" These headlines suggest terms like \"literary secrets,\" \"historical fiction,\" \"accuracy,\" \"artistic license,\" \"philosophical themes,\" and \"code,\" which are all relevant to understanding Dan Brown's work and its impact.\n\nAs I extract terms, I'm looking for concepts that represent precise aspects of Dan Brown's writing, such as \"suspense,\" \"symbolism,\" \"conspiracy theories,\" \"historical themes,\" and \"literary influences.\" I also consider terms related to the societal impact of his books, like \"popular culture,\" \"controversies,\" and \"adaptations.\" Filtering out generic words, I focus on distinctive terms that would appear in high-quality content about Dan Brown.\n\nThrough this process, I've synthesized a deeper understanding of what the user might be looking for and how to expand the query to capture the essence of Dan Brown's literary significance. The technique has helped me balance structured steps with natural thought patterns, ensuring that the final terms emerge logically from both the method and my intuition about the topic.\n\nBy applying the journalistic investigation technique, I've moved from a superficial query about Dan Brown being an author to a richer exploration of his writing style, influences, themes, and the controversies surrounding his work. This expanded query can now guide a more insightful search, one that uncovers not just factual information but also the nuances and complexities of Dan Brown's literary world.",
