  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"The Tenth Doctor recruits Wilfred Mott to assist him throughout The End of Time,\" my initial impression is that this is a very specific event within the Doctor Who universe. The user seems to be looking for detailed information about the circumstances and motivations behind Wilfred Mott's involvement with the Tenth Doctor. However, the existing results are too general, focusing on character and episode information without delving into the specifics of their partnership.\n\nTo improve the search results, I need to apply a structured approach. Let me use the technique of query expansion, which involves identifying ineffective terms, performing breadth expansion to find related concepts, and then applying depth expansion to dive deeper into one of those concepts. This technique should help because it systematically explores the query's context and related ideas, potentially uncovering more targeted and relevant information.\n\nFirst, I identify the ineffective terms: \"Doctor,\" \"Wilfred Mott,\" \"assist,\" and \"throughout.\" These terms are either too broad or obvious, given the context of the query. Next, I move on to breadth expansion, where I consider concepts that are increasingly distant but still relevant to the original query. Terms like \"companion,\" \"crisis,\" \"regenerations,\" \"Time Lord,\" \"future,\" \"conspiracy,\" and \"interference\" come to mind. These terms start to paint a picture of the broader narrative and thematic elements surrounding Wilfred Mott's recruitment.\n\nHowever, to truly enhance the query, I need to apply depth expansion. I choose the term \"conspiracy\" as my focal point because it implies a complex, hidden narrative that could be central to understanding the Doctor's motivations and Wilfred's role. By exploring \"conspiracy\" in depth, I consider related terms such as \"shadowy organization,\" \"secret agendas,\" \"government involvement,\" and \"alien threat.\" This depth expansion reveals a richer context that could provide the specific details the user is looking for.\n\nAs I apply this technique, I find myself occasionally stepping back to reassess the query and its goals. I realize that the key to a successful expansion is not just in applying the systematic steps of the technique but also in allowing for natural, intuitive connections to emerge. For instance, recognizing that \"conspiracy\" could be a pivotal element leads me to explore related concepts that might not have been immediately obvious.\n\nThrough this process of structured expansion and natural insight, I begin to see how terms like \"crisis,\" \"companion,\" \"conspiracy,\" \"shadow government,\" and \"alien threat\" could form a cohesive and targeted query. These terms capture the essence of the original query while introducing new dimensions that can lead to more specific and relevant search results.\n\nSynthesizing my thoughts, I conclude that the most effective approach to expanding the original query involves combining the systematic application of query expansion techniques with the natural flow of intuitive connections and insights. By doing so, the final augmented query emerges not just as a list of terms but as a thoughtful and targeted expression of what the user is truly seeking.\n\nThe final terms for the augmented query are \"crisis companion conspiracy shadow government alien threat.\" These terms reflect a balance between the structured technique of query expansion and the natural cognitive patterns that enhance and refine the search process.",
