  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"Key & Peele has yet to be nominated for a Writers Guild Award,\" this makes me think of the importance of specific award nominations in understanding a show's or an individual's recognition within the industry. Though the user might actually be trying to confirm or deny the nomination status, I sense there's an underlying desire to understand the broader context of awards and nominations for comedic writing and television series.\n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here... Let me approach this using the expansion technique, which involves systematically identifying gaps, ineffective terms, and then applying breadth and depth expansions to uncover novel, relevant search terms. This should help because it allows us to transition from general queries to targeted, specific searches that can yield more precise results.\n\nFirst, I need to elucidate the goals and gaps in the original query. The primary objective seems to be confirming or denying the Writers Guild Award nomination for Key & Peele and possibly listing their award nominations. A gap here is the lack of specific terms related to award nominations and the focus on general information about the show.\n\nNext, identifying ineffective terms is crucial. Terms like \"Key & Peele,\" \"has yet to be nominated,\" and \"Writers Guild Award\" are too broad or specific to the original query and might not yield diverse results. I should avoid these terms in the augmented query to ensure novelty and diversity in the search results.\n\nNow, moving on to breadth expansion, I aim to list candidate terms that introduce increasingly distant but relevant concepts to the original query. This includes terms like \"television comedy awards,\" \"award shows,\" \"comedy writing recognition,\" \"writers guild,\" and \"screenwriting awards.\" These terms start to move away from the specific show and award, exploring the broader landscape of comedy awards and writing recognition.\n\nFor depth expansion, I choose one of these distant topics, \"Primetime Emmy Awards,\" and delve deeper into related terms. This includes \"Comedy Series Writing nominations\" and \"Award nomination history for comedic television series.\" By focusing on these specific areas, I can uncover terms that are both relevant and novel, avoiding the ineffective terms identified earlier.\n\nApplying the expansion technique systematically, I consider synonym replacement, conceptual expansion, and contextual expansion. For instance, instead of using \"Writers Guild Award,\" I could explore terms related to \"screenwriting awards\" or \"television comedy awards\" to introduce diversity. This systematic approach ensures that the augmented query is both targeted and diverse, avoiding generic terms and focusing on high-quality search terms.\n\nThrough this process of applying the expansion technique and exploring related threads, I believe the terms from the depth expansion, along with additional high-relevance terms, would be most effective for forming an augmented query. These terms capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, providing a pathway to more precise and relevant search results.\n\nThe augmented query that emerges from this thought process is: \"Primetime Emmy Awards Comedy Series Writing nominations award nomination history.\" This query is novel, diverse, and targeted, ensuring that the search results will provide the user with the confirmation or denial of the Writers Guild Award nomination and a list of Key & Peele's award nominations, all while avoiding ineffective terms and focusing on high-quality search terms.",
