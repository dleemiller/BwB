  "thought_process": "As I delve into the query about secret and technologically advanced airplanes produced in Burbank, California, my initial thoughts revolve around the historical significance and the technological marvels of such aircraft. The mention of Burbank, California, immediately brings to mind Lockheed's Skunk Works, a legendary facility known for developing innovative, often classified, aircraft. The U-2 spy plane and the SR-71 Blackbird are iconic examples of the technologically advanced aircraft that have been associated with Skunk Works. However, I'm aware that there's more to uncover, including other specific aircraft models, the historical context in which they were developed, and the technological advancements that made them so advanced for their time.\n\nMy approach to expanding this query will utilize the conceptual graph traversal technique. This involves constructing a graph that represents the relationships between the core concepts and entities mentioned in the query and then traversing this graph to identify relevant expansion terms. The core concepts here include \"secret airplanes,\" \"technologically advanced airplanes,\" \"Burbank, California,\" and \"Lockheed's Skunk Works.\" The search intent is informational, aiming to identify specific aircraft models, understand the historical context, and explore technological advancements.\n\nConstructing the conceptual graph, I start with these core nodes and then expand to first-order connections, such as the types of aircraft developed at Skunk Works (e.g., U-2, SR-71, F-117 Nighthawk), the historical periods during which these aircraft were developed (e.g., Cold War), and the technological innovations they embodied (e.g., jet engines, stealth technology). Second-order connections might include broader concepts like espionage, military strategies, and aerospace engineering advancements.\n\nFor expansion path selection, I identify several promising directions:\n- Synonymous terms for \"secret\" and \"technologically advanced\" to capture a broader range of relevant documents.\n- Hierarchical terms that are narrower or broader than \"airplanes,\" such as \"spy planes\" or \"military aircraft.\"\n- Compositional terms related to the parts or attributes of these aircraft, like \"jet engines\" or \"stealth materials.\"\n- Contextual terms that consider the settings or scenarios in which these aircraft were used, such as \"Cold War espionage\" or \"reconnaissance missions.\"\n- Domain-specific terminology from the fields of aerospace engineering and military aviation.\n\nExtracting and filtering terms, I prioritize those that are highly relevant, distinctive, specific, and likely to appear in relevant documents. This process yields terms like \"spy planes,\" \"stealth technology,\" \"Cold War aircraft,\" \"Lockheed Martin,\" \"aerospace engineering,\" and \"reconnaissance aircraft.\"\n\nThrough this structured approach, complemented by natural cognitive patterns that allow for reconsideration and intuitive leaps, I synthesize the insights to form an expanded query. This query maintains the original search intent while incorporating valuable alternative pathways for retrieval, ensuring a more comprehensive search result.\n\nThe final expanded terms are designed to work within a BM25 index, balancing specificity and searchability. The augmented query, combining the original query with the selected expansion terms, is crafted to retrieve documents that not only match the explicit query terms but also capture the implicit aspects of the user's information need.",
