  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"SummerSlam was a concert,\" my initial impression is that there's been a mix-up because SummerSlam is commonly known as a professional wrestling event, not a music concert. This makes me think that the user might actually be trying to find information about a music event that occurred around the same time as SummerSlam or perhaps a concert with a similar name. However, without more context, it's difficult to pinpoint exactly what the user is looking for.\n\nTo approach this systematically, I'll use the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal technique. This involves analyzing the query, constructing a conceptual graph, selecting expansion paths, extracting and filtering terms, and finally, forming an augmented query.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the query. The core concepts here are \"SummerSlam\" and \"concert.\" The search intent seems to be informational, with the user looking to find details about a specific event. An implicit assumption is that SummerSlam, in this context, refers to a musical event rather than a wrestling one.\n\nConstructing the conceptual graph, we start with \"SummerSlam\" and \"concert\" as core nodes. First-order connections for \"SummerSlam\" could include \"professional wrestling\" (to acknowledge its common association), and for \"concert,\" they could include \"music,\" \"live performance,\" and \"event.\" Second-order connections might involve specific music genres, venues, or performers associated with SummerSlam if it were a concert. Domain contexts include music festivals and live events.\n\nFor expansion path selection, several directions seem promising:\n- Synonymous terms: Looking for terms that mean the same as \"concert\" or \"music event.\"\n- Compositional terms: Considering parts of a concert, like \"performers\" or \"venue.\"\n- Contextual terms: Thinking about settings or scenarios where SummerSlam as a concert would make sense, such as \"summer music festivals\" or \"live performances in August.\"\n\nExtracting and filtering terms, we might consider:\n- For synonymous terms: \"music festival,\" \"live show,\" \"gig.\"\n- For compositional terms: \"band,\" \"singer,\" \"music venue.\"\n- For contextual terms: \"summer event,\" \"August concert,\" \"outdoor festival.\"\n\nHowever, we need to filter these to ensure they're relevant, distinctive, specific, and searchable. Terms like \"music festival\" and \"live performance\" seem highly relevant and could help retrieve documents about SummerSlam if it were indeed a concert. \"Summer event\" and \"outdoor festival\" could also be useful, providing context for when and where such a concert might occur.\n\nAs I apply the technique, I realize that the key is balancing the structured approach with natural thought patterns. For instance, my initial instinct to question the association of SummerSlam with concerts is validated by the technique's emphasis on understanding the core concepts and their common associations. However, the systematic approach ensures that I consider a wide range of possibilities, including the potential for SummerSlam to refer to a different kind of event altogether.\n\nUpon further reflection, it's clear that the expansion terms should aim to capture the essence of what the user might be looking for: information about a music concert, possibly named SummerSlam or occurring around the same time as the well-known wrestling event. The terms \"music festival,\" \"live performance,\" and \"summer event\" resonate with this goal, offering pathways to relevant documents that might otherwise be overlooked due to the query's ambiguity.\n\nThrough this process of applying the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal technique and exploring related threads, I believe the most effective terms for an augmented query would focus on clarifying the musical aspect of the event while keeping the core concept of SummerSlam intact. Thus, an augmented query could look like: \"SummerSlam music festival\" OR \"SummerSlam live performance\" OR \"SummerSlam concert event.\"\n\nThis approach not only adheres to the structured technique but also allows for the natural flow of thoughts and associations that can lead to more intuitive and effective query expansion.",
