  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"Cary Elwes was born in April 1962,\" this makes me think of the actor's biography, though the user might actually be trying to find more specific information about his early life, education, or how he got into acting. The original query is quite broad and doesn't capture the complexity of what someone might be looking for when searching for information on Cary Elwes. I need to refine this search by focusing on his unique attributes, life stages, and experiences that set him apart from others.\n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here, but let me approach this using the expansion technique provided, which involves being specific and diverse, applying varied augmentation techniques, and avoiding overlapping terms. This should help because it allows me to systematically explore different dimensions of Cary Elwes' life and career, leading to a more comprehensive search query.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the primary objectives and gaps in the original query. The objective is to find information about Cary Elwes, but the query doesn't specify what aspect of his life or career the user is interested in. A significant gap is the lack of specificity about what the user wants to know beyond his birth month and year.\n\nNext, I should identify ineffective terms that are too broad or non-precise. Terms like \"was born\" are not helpful as they are generic and don't add much value to narrowing down the search to Cary Elwes specifically.\n\nFor breadth expansion, I'll consider terms that introduce new dimensions to the query but are still relevant. This includes terms like \"Theatre,\" \"Early Roles,\" \"Film School,\" \"British Acting,\" and \"London Theatre Scene.\" These terms start to paint a picture of Cary Elwes' professional and educational background but still need to be more focused.\n\nNow, for depth expansion, I'll choose one of these broader topics and dive deeper. Let's take \"Royal Academy of Dramatic Art\" as it directly relates to Cary Elwes' education and training as an actor. Going deeper into this topic, I can include terms like \"Laurence Olivier,\" \"Classical Acting,\" \"Stage Debut,\" and \"West End Productions.\" These terms not only specify his educational background but also his early career and the type of acting he was trained in.\n\nAs I apply these steps, I'm starting to see a clearer picture of what the augmented query should look like. It should include terms from the depth expansion, like \"Royal Academy of Dramatic Art,\" \"Laurence Olivier,\" \"Classical Acting,\" \"Stage Debut,\" and \"West End Productions,\" because they are specific, diverse, and directly relevant to Cary Elwes' life and career.\n\nI just had a realization that connecting his educational background with his professional debut and the context in which he worked (like the West End) could provide a rich set of search results that are both relevant and non-overlapping with the original query. This approach ensures that the search terms are not only about his biography but also about his professional development and achievements.\n\nThrough this process of applying the expansion technique and exploring related threads, I believe the terms that would be most effective for an augmented query are those that capture his unique professional and educational attributes. By focusing on these aspects, we can create a search query that is both targeted and diverse, likely to yield results that are relevant and informative about Cary Elwes' life and career.",
