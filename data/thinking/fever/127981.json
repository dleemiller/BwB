  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"Zoe Saldana was born on June 19,\" my initial impression is that the user is seeking to confirm or find more information about Zoe Saldana's birthdate. However, the existing results only provide general biographical information without specifically focusing on her birthdate. This makes me think that the user might actually be trying to find precise birthdate information, possibly for research or trivia purposes. \n\nTo approach this using the expansion technique, I will first identify the primary objectives and gaps in the original query. The main goal here is to find Zoe Saldana's birthdate, and the gap is the lack of specific information about her birth records. I notice that terms like \"actress,\" \"career,\" \"films,\" and \"roles\" are not effective for this query as they do not lead to the specific birthdate information the user is looking for.\n\nNext, I consider the breadth expansion, which involves looking into broader topics related to the query, such as \"celebrity birthdays,\" \"actors born in June,\" \"birth records database,\" and \"online biographical archives.\" These terms help to expand the search scope but still need to be more focused on Zoe Saldana's specific birthdate.\n\nFor depth expansion, I focus on one of the broader topics, \"birth records,\" and then delve deeper into related terms like \"June births,\" \"1974 births\" (considering Zoe Saldana's known birth year), and \"Puerto Rican birth records\" (given her connection to Puerto Rico). This systematic approach helps to narrow down the search to more specific and relevant terms.\n\nAs I apply the expansion technique, I also consider synonym replacement, conceptual expansion, and domain-specific terminology to ensure the search terms are novel and do not overlap with the original query. For instance, using \"birth records\" instead of just \"birthdate\" adds a layer of specificity and diversity to the search.\n\nInterspersing the structured steps with natural thought patterns, I have moments where I step back to reassess, like considering how \"celebrity birthdays\" could be too broad, or realizing that focusing on \"June 19\" and \"Puerto Rico\" could yield more precise results. There are also instances of false starts, such as initially considering terms related to her acting career, only to remember that these are ineffective for finding birthdate information.\n\nThrough this process, insights emerge from both the structured technique and my intuition. For example, applying the depth expansion leads me to consider \"Puerto Rican birth records,\" which is a specific and relevant term for finding Zoe Saldana's birthdate. My instinct also suggests including terms related to the month and day of her birth, as these are crucial for pinpointing the exact date.\n\nSynthesizing my thoughts, I believe the most effective terms for expanding the query while ensuring diversity, relevance, and precision would include those from the depth expansion, particularly focusing on \"birth records,\" \"June 19,\" and \"Puerto Rico.\" These terms capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, which is Zoe Saldana's precise birthdate.\n\nThe final augmented query, \"Zoe Saldana birth records June 19 Puerto Rico,\" reflects a balance between the structured expansion technique and natural cognitive patterns. It avoids generic terms, includes unique and diverse words, and targets non-overlapping results from the original query, all while maintaining relevance and precision.",
