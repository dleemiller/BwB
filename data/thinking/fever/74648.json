  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"Ned Stark was introduced in 1996's A Game of Thrones,\" this makes me think of the book's narrative structure and how characters are introduced. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the significance of Ned Stark's introduction, it seems like they're asking for the specific point where he's first mentioned. I'm seeing several possibilities here, but to approach this systematically, let me use the expansion technique outlined, which involves understanding the primary objectives of the query, identifying ineffective terms, expanding the query through breadth and depth, and applying techniques like synonym replacement and conceptual expansion.\n\nStarting with the original query, it's clear the user is after specific information about Ned Stark's introduction in \"A Game of Thrones.\" The primary objective is to pinpoint where in the book Ned Stark is first introduced and understand the narrative context surrounding this introduction. The ineffective terms in this case would be broad or non-precise, such as \"Ned Stark\" and \"character description,\" as they don't specifically address the point of introduction or the context.\n\nFor breadth expansion, terms like \"prologue,\" \"opening chapters,\" \"narrative structure,\" \"world-building,\" \"plot devices,\" and \"foreshadowing\" come to mind. These terms start to flesh out the context in which Ned Stark's introduction would be significant. Then, for depth expansion, focusing on one of these areas, such as \"narrative structure,\" leads to more specific terms like \"exposition,\" \"setting,\" \"initial conflict,\" \"kingdom of Winterfell,\" and \"Eddard Stark's role.\" This depth expansion starts to reveal the intricacies of the story that could surround Ned Stark's introduction.\n\nApplying the technique of conceptual expansion, I consider how the concept of \"narrative structure\" can be further detailed in the context of \"A Game of Thrones.\" This involves looking into how the story is set up, the initial setting of Winterfell, and how Eddard Stark's role as Warden of the North might be introduced. The term \"prologue\" is particularly interesting because it sets the stage for the entire series, and understanding its content could provide insight into the subsequent introduction of major characters like Ned Stark.\n\nThrough this process, I'm also keeping in mind the need to avoid generic terms and focus on those that will yield non-overlapping, relevant results. Terms like \"exposition\" and \"setting\" are crucial because they directly relate to how a character's introduction is framed within the narrative. \"Initial conflict\" is also significant as it might foreshadow or directly involve Ned Stark, providing context to his character's introduction.\n\nThe augmented query that emerges from this process includes terms like \"prologue exposition setting Winterfell Eddard Stark initial conflict.\" These terms capture the essence of what we're looking for: the specific context and narrative structure surrounding Ned Stark's introduction in \"A Game of Thrones.\" This combination of terms should yield results that are both relevant and precise, avoiding the generic information that the original query might have uncovered.\n\nIn synthesizing this thought process, it's clear that applying a structured approach to query expansion, while also allowing for natural cognitive patterns and intuitive leaps, can significantly enhance the search for specific information within a complex narrative like \"A Game of Thrones.\" The technique helps in systematically exploring the query's objectives, expanding the search terms in both breadth and depth, and ensuring that the final query is targeted and relevant.",
