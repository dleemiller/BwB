  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"A near-Earth object is not a solar body,\" this makes me think of the distinctions between various celestial entities and how they're classified. Though the user might actually be trying to understand why near-Earth objects (NEOs) are categorized differently from what we typically consider solar bodies, like planets. Hmm, not sure yet, but it seems like we need to delve into definitions and properties of both NEOs and solar bodies to provide a clear differentiation.\n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here, so let me approach this using the Conceptual Graph Traversal technique, which involves constructing a graph of concepts related to the query and then traversing it to find relevant expansion terms. This should help because it allows us to systematically explore the semantic space around the query, capturing both explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking.\n\nStarting with the original query, I identify \"near-Earth object\" and \"solar body\" as core concepts. The search intent seems informational, aiming to understand the classification and characteristics of NEOs versus solar bodies. Implicitly, there's an assumption that these terms have distinct definitions and properties that set them apart.\n\nConstructing the conceptual graph, I have:\n- Core nodes: near-Earth object, solar body\n- First-order connections: definitions, classifications, orbital patterns, compositions\n- Second-order connections: asteroid, comet, planet, space rock, minor planet (as related concepts)\n- Domain contexts: astronomy, astrophysics, space science\n\nFor expansion path selection, I identify the following promising directions:\n- Synonymous terms: asteroid, comet, meteoroid for NEOs; planet, dwarf planet for solar bodies\n- Hierarchical terms: celestial object (broader), meteorite (narrower)\n- Compositional terms: orbital characteristics, composition (metallic, rocky, icy)\n- Contextual terms: impact risk, space missions, astronomical observations\n- Domain-specific terminology: NEO classification systems, planetary differentiation processes\n\nExtracting and filtering terms, I prioritize those that are most relevant, distinctive, specific, and searchable. For synonymous terms, \"asteroid\" and \"comet\" are strong candidates. Under hierarchical terms, \"celestial object\" is too broad, but \"meteorite\" could be useful. Compositional terms like \"orbital characteristics\" and \"composition\" are essential. Contextually, \"impact risk\" and \"space missions\" could provide valuable insights. Domain-specific terms like \"NEO classification\" and \"planetary differentiation\" offer depth.\n\nThrough this process of applying Conceptual Graph Traversal and exploring related threads, I believe the following terms would be most effective for expanding the query: near-Earth object, asteroid, comet, solar body, orbit, composition, celestial object, meteorite, impact risk, space mission, NEO classification, planetary differentiation. These capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, enhancing the original query with weighted selections of the best expansion terms.\n\nThe final augmented query could look like: \"near-Earth object AND NOT solar body, define asteroid, explain NEO composition and orbit, impact risk, space missions, NEO classification.\" This approach not only clarifies the distinction between NEOs and solar bodies but also opens up pathways to explore related concerns and characteristics, making the search more comprehensive and informative.",
