  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"Bank of America has platforms,\" this makes me think of various financial and technological aspects that Bank of America might be involved in. Though the user might actually be trying to find out about specific services or features offered by these platforms, it's not entirely clear yet. The original query is quite broad, so I'll need to use a structured approach to refine it.\n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here, but to organize my thoughts, I'll use the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal technique. This involves analyzing the query, constructing a conceptual graph, selecting expansion paths, extracting terms, and filtering them based on relevance, distinctiveness, specificity, and searchability. This should help because it systematically explores the semantic space around the original query, potentially uncovering more precise and relevant terms that users might be looking for.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the query. The core concepts here are \"Bank of America\" and \"platforms.\" The search intent seems informational, as the user is likely looking to learn more about the types of platforms Bank of America offers or the features of these platforms. An implicit assumption might be that the user is interested in digital platforms, given the broad nature of the term \"platforms.\"\n\nConstructing the conceptual graph, we have core nodes like \"Bank of America\" and \"platforms.\" First-order connections might include \"financial services,\" \"online banking,\" and \"mobile apps.\" Second-order connections could involve more specific services like \"investment platforms,\" \"wealth management,\" and \"loan services.\" The domain context here is clearly financial services and banking.\n\nFor expansion path selection, I identify several promising directions:\n- Synonymous terms, such as \"Bank of America solutions\" or \"Bank of America services.\"\n- Hierarchical terms, like \"digital banking platforms\" or \"financial technology solutions.\"\n- Compositional terms, including \"online banking features\" or \"mobile banking apps.\"\n- Contextual terms, such as \"personal banking platforms\" or \"business banking solutions.\"\n- Domain-specific terminology, like \"retail banking services\" or \"corporate banking products.\"\n\nExtracting and filtering terms, I consider relevance, distinctiveness, specificity, and searchability. Terms like \"online banking,\" \"mobile app,\" \"investment platforms,\" and \"digital products\" seem highly relevant and specific. They also have low lexical overlap with the original terms and are likely to appear in relevant documents.\n\nAs I apply the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal technique, I notice that it leads me to terms like \"financial services,\" \"digital banking,\" and \"mobile banking,\" which are directly related to the original query. This technique also helps me discover more specific terms that users might be interested in, such as \"wealth management services\" or \"credit card platforms.\" My intuition suggests that including terms related to the accessibility and features of these platforms could also be valuable, such as \"user interface\" or \"security features.\"\n\nThrough this process of applying the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal technique and exploring related threads, I believe the expanded terms should include a mix of specific services, digital products, and features that Bank of America offers. These terms capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, providing a more detailed and targeted query for searching.\n\nThe final expanded query, incorporating the best expansion terms, could be: \"Bank of America platforms services features digital products online banking mobile app investment wealth management credit cards loan services.\" This augmented query aims to balance the breadth of the original query with the specificity needed to retrieve relevant and useful information about Bank of America's platforms.",
