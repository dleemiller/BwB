  "query": "Religious symbols cause division within Western society.  Religious symbols can be seen as possible tools for fuelling division within society. When some women wear the Hijab it creates pressure on other Muslim women to also cover their heads. Pressure comes both socially from wanting to look like other women in their community and religiously from imams and family leaders pressing for observance. As such, Muslims themselves are divided and religious oppression against women is internalized.1 Approving of Muslim head coverings in society cements the Hijab as an essential tenet of Islam, in the minds of non-Muslims as well as believers. However, many different schools of Islam exist and as on other issues, they often disagree how to interpret the Koran's dress prescriptions. Moderate interpretations accept modest forms of modern dress while severe interpretations require full covering with the Burka or similar veil. Banning the veil furthers the cause of moderate interpretations and prevents the entrenchment of severe interpretations.  1 Rumy Hassan, 'Banning the hijab', Workers Power 283 February 2004, accessed on 24th July 2011",

  "thought_process": "As I delve into the query about religious symbols causing division within Western society, my mind immediately starts racing with associations. The topic of the hijab and its implications on Muslim women comes to the forefront, but I also think about the broader context of religious freedom, societal cohesion, and the diverse interpretations of Islamic dress codes. The user's query seems to be touching on a complex web of issues, from cultural norms and personal beliefs to legal frameworks and theological debates.\n\nTo approach this query expansion systematically, I decide to employ the technique of User Intent and Journey Mapping. This involves creating distinct user personas, analyzing their search vocabulary, mapping their information journey, and identifying contextual scenarios where they need this information. By doing so, I aim to capture the diverse perspectives, information needs, and search intents of users at various stages of their journey from awareness to expertise.\n\nMy first step is to create four user personas: the Novice Muslim Woman, the Intermediate Sociology Student, the Advanced Legal Scholar, and the Expert Imam. Each persona has unique goals, motivations, prior knowledge, and vocabulary, which will influence their search terms and information needs. For instance, the Novice Muslim Woman might start with basic questions about the cultural significance of the hijab, while the Advanced Legal Scholar would likely explore legal precedents on religious expression and constitutional rights regarding dress codes.\n\nAs I analyze the search vocabulary for each persona, I notice a progression from general to specific terms. The Novice Muslim Woman might begin with 'hijab meaning' or 'why do Muslim women wear hijab,' whereas the Intermediate Sociology Student would research 'religious symbols and social division' or 'impact of religious dress codes.' The Advanced Legal Scholar and Expert Imam would delve into more specialized terminology, such as 'legal frameworks surrounding religious freedom' or 'interpretations of Quranic verses on dress.'\n\nThe information journey mapping reveals a trajectory from basic definitions and cultural context to more advanced concepts, such as legal analysis, philosophical debates, and theological discussions. At each stage, users require different types of information, from introductory explanations to in-depth analyses and expert opinions. By understanding these progressive information needs, I can identify high-value terms that reflect the users' search intents and purposes.\n\nThe contextual scenarios further illuminate the specific situations where users need this information. A Muslim woman might be seeking guidance on hijab etiquette in the workplace, while a student is researching the historical evolution of religious symbols in Western societies. A policymaker might be considering legislation regarding religious attire in public spaces, and an imam could be addressing concerns about hijab within his community. These scenarios highlight the practical applications and real-world implications of the query.\n\nAs I extract intent-based terms from the personas, scenarios, and journey mapping, I notice a rich tapestry of vocabulary that reflects the users' diverse backgrounds and information needs. Terms like 'understand,' 'explain,' 'compare,' 'contrast,' 'analyze,' 'interpret,' 'evaluate,' 'apply,' 'solve,' 'research,' 'explore,' 'discuss,' 'debate,' 'advocate,' and 'protect' emerge as essential for capturing the search intents and purposes.\n\nThrough this systematic approach, I have expanded the original query to encompass a broader range of topics, from cultural context and interpretation of dress codes to legal frameworks, religious freedom, and social cohesion. The augmented query now includes terms like 'religious symbols,' 'societal division,' 'hijab,' 'cultural context,' 'interpretation of dress codes,' 'legal frameworks,' 'religious freedom,' 'social cohesion,' 'Western societies,' and 'Islam.' These terms reflect the complex and multifaceted nature of the original query, ensuring that users with diverse backgrounds and information needs can find relevant and accurate information throughout their journey from awareness to expertise.",
