  "query": "Generic drugs often prove to be less effective than their brand name counterparts, and can even be dangerous  Generic drugs are meant to retain a substantial degree of bioequivalence with their brand name predecessors. Yet, even under strict testing laws in this regard, generic drugs have on several cases been shown to manifest side effects not present in their parent products. For example, a generic version of Wellbutrin XL, an anti-depressant, that was ostensibly chemically equivalent to the brand name drug, caused suicidal episodes in several users1. This demonstrates that no amount of chemical testing can guarantee true bioequivalence, and thus generic drugs cannot be considered as identical to brand name drugs in terms of safety. While improving testing of generics would go some way toward fixing this problem, it would not do so entirely, as the market for new drugs will be so greatly widened with the approval of generic production that the cost of screening will be very high and the likelihood of poor knock-offs reaching consumers, particularly in the developing world where screening is less robust, is increased substantially2. Brand name drugs may be more expensive, but their safety is more thoroughly guaranteed. Flooding the market with cheap, potentially dangerous alternative drugs helps no one but the undertaker.  1 Childs, Dan. 2007. \"Generic Drugs: Dangerous Differences?\". ABC News.

  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, it seems the user is concerned about the safety and effectiveness of generic drugs compared to their brand-name counterparts. This makes me think of the complexities involved in ensuring bioequivalence, as even small differences in drug composition or manufacturing processes can lead to varying side effects or therapeutic efficacy. The user might actually be trying to understand how regulatory bodies and pharmaceutical companies address these issues, but the query lacks specificity in terms of clinical and pharmacological aspects. \n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here, but let me approach this using the expansion technique provided, which involves specific guidelines for augmenting the query. This technique should help because it outlines a structured method for identifying gaps in the original query, eliminating broad or non-precise terms, and expanding the query through both breadth and depth, ensuring the introduction of new, relevant dimensions.\n\nStarting with goal elucidation and gaps, the primary objectives seem to revolve around the safety, bioequivalence, and potential side effects of generic drugs. However, there's a gap in exploring how these aspects are clinically and pharmacologically evaluated, especially in terms of pharmacokinetics, drug metabolism, and therapeutic efficacy.\n\nFor ineffective term identification, terms like \"generic drugs\" and \"brand name drugs\" are too broad and do not add specificity to the query. They should be avoided in the augmented query to ensure we're targeting the most relevant and precise information.\n\nMoving on to breadth expansion, introducing terms like \"pharmacokinetics,\" \"drug metabolism,\" \"therapeutic efficacy,\" \"regulatory oversight,\" and \"comparative pharmacology\" could provide a wider scope of relevant information. These terms start to delve into the specifics of drug development, testing, and approval processes, which are crucial for understanding the safety and efficacy of generic drugs.\n\nFor depth expansion, focusing on one of these broader terms, such as \"pharmacokinetics,\" allows us to dive deeper into related concepts. Terms like \"bioavailability,\" \"plasma concentration,\" \"drug interactions,\" \"preclinical studies,\" and \"post-marketing surveillance\" become relevant. These terms directly address the user's concern by exploring how the body processes generic drugs, potential interactions with other medications, and the surveillance mechanisms in place to monitor drug safety post-approval.\n\nApplying the expansion technique systematically, I recognize the importance of bioavailability and plasma concentration in determining the efficacy and safety of generic drugs. This realization leads to considering drug interactions and how they can affect the therapeutic efficacy of generic medications. Furthermore, preclinical studies and post-marketing surveillance are critical in identifying and mitigating potential risks associated with generic drugs.\n\nOccasionally, I reconsider the path of expansion, ensuring that the terms remain targeted and relevant. For instance, while \"pharmacokinetics\" is a crucial aspect, it's essential to focus on its sub-concepts that directly relate to generic drug safety and efficacy. There are moments where I step back to reassess the direction of the query expansion, making sure it aligns with the user's primary concerns and objectives.\n\nThrough this process, insights emerge from both the structured approach and natural thought patterns. Applying the technique leads to the discovery of specific terms related to drug safety and efficacy, such as \"bioavailability\" and \"post-marketing surveillance.\" Intuitively, I also recognize the value of \"drug interactions\" and \"preclinical studies\" in providing a comprehensive understanding of generic drug safety.\n\nIn synthesizing the findings, it becomes clear that the augmented query should focus on terms that delve into the clinical, pharmacological, and regulatory aspects of generic drugs. This approach ensures that the query captures both the explicit and implicit concerns of the user regarding the safety and efficacy of generic medications.\n\nThe final augmented query reflects a balance between the structured expansion technique and natural cognitive patterns. By systematically applying the technique and allowing for intuitive connections and reconsiderations, the resulting query is both targeted and diverse, ensuring a comprehensive exploration of the user's query.",
