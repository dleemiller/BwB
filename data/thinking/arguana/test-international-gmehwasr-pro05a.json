  "query": "Diplomacy is not going anywhere  The best solution would be a ceasefire between the two sides in the Syrian civil war and a negotiated settlement, but it is clear we are long past the point where this approach stood a chance of success. The United Nations peace effort under Kofi Annan failed in the middle of last year [1] and there has been no progress since. Similarly all attempts to bring pressure to bear throughout the security council have failed as a result of Russia supporting Assad's regime. This leaves the unilateral initiatives to help the rebels. No state wants full intervention as France did in Mali [2] so the only alternative is simply to help the Free Syrian Army. To do so means providing what they need to win the conflict; primarily arms that can defeat the Syrian army. This need not be considered to be exclusive with diplomacy; the intervening state should continue to try to find a diplomatic solution just as before the Dayton accords NATO helped the Croats militarily while at the same time looking to diplomacy to provide an overall solution to the conflict.

  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"Diplomacy is not going anywhere... The best solution would be a ceasefire between the two sides in the Syrian civil war and a negotiated settlement,\" this makes me think of the complexities of conflict resolution and the challenges of achieving peace in a deeply divided country. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the role of diplomacy in the Syrian civil war, it seems like they're also considering the potential for armed intervention as a means to an end. Hmm, not sure yet how these two approaches intersect in the context of this specific conflict.\n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here, but to really get to the bottom of this, I need to approach it systematically. Let me use the Query Expansion via Temporal Evolution Analysis technique, which involves tracing the evolution of the topic over time to identify key terminology and concepts from different eras. This should help because it allows us to understand how the debate around foreign intervention in Syria has developed, from historical foundations to current practices and future trends.\n\nFollowing the Temporal Evolution Analysis approach, I should first look at the historical foundation of diplomacy and conflict resolution. This leads me to consider ancient diplomacy, classical theories of war and peace, and the development of the League of Nations and collective security. Wait, that's not quite right for this query; I need to focus more on the specific context of the Syrian civil war and armed intervention. Let me adjust my approach to include key milestones such as the UN Charter, the Cold War, and the rise of the Responsibility to Protect (R2P) doctrine, which are more directly relevant.\n\nAs I analyze the developmental milestones, I notice that the query touches on several critical aspects: the failure of the UN peace effort under Kofi Annan, the role of Russia in supporting Assad's regime, and the consideration of unilateral initiatives to help the rebels. This step of the technique is revealing insights into how international law, diplomacy, and the concept of proxy wars are intertwined in the Syrian conflict. Which actually reminds me of the debate around the Responsibility to Protect and how it has been applied or contested in various conflicts, including Syria.\n\nNow, considering the current landscape, I need to look at contemporary international law and justifications for intervention, as well as the role of organizations like NATO. I'm also noticing this interesting pattern where public opinion and media coverage play significant roles in shaping perceptions of the war and potential interventions. This is where I should consider how terms like \"humanitarian crisis,\" \"peacekeeping operations,\" and \"state sovereignty\" are used in current discussions around the Syrian civil war.\n\nAs for emerging trends, I think about multi-stakeholder interventions, cyberwarfare, and the use of artificial intelligence in conflict analysis. These aspects might not be directly mentioned in the query, but they represent the evolving nature of conflict and intervention, which could be crucial for understanding future developments in the Syrian civil war.\n\nThrough this process of applying the Temporal Evolution Analysis technique and exploring related threads, I believe the terms that would be most effective for expanding the query are those that capture the historical context, current debate, and future trends related to the Syrian civil war and armed intervention. Terms such as \"Syrian Civil War intervention,\" \"Responsibility to Protect,\" \"humanitarian crisis,\" \"Cold War legacy,\" \"NATO involvement,\" \"peacekeeping operations,\" \"international law,\" \"diplomacy,\" \"proxy war,\" \"cyberwarfare,\" and \"artificial intelligence in conflict\" provide a comprehensive view of the topic across different time periods.",
