  "query": "The boycott would affect Poland and the Ukrainian people as well as Yanukovych  A boycott of Euro 2012 even if it was meant to be limited to Ukraine would negatively impact on the whole tournament. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tust argued \"It is in Poland's undisputed interest to hold the games in Poland and Ukraine without a hitch and to prevent politics from ruining the great effort\", [1] any boycott would unnecessarily move the attention away from the games itself towards politics.  It should also be remembered that Viktor Yanukovych does not represent the whole of Ukraine and only won by a narrow margin with 48.95% of the vote compared to Yulia Timoshenko\u2019s 45.47% in the second round. [2] Arseniy Yatsenyuk leader of the Front for Change has urged leaders not to boycott \"The best scenario would be if the European leaders attended the championship, but did not meet President Yanukovych. It's supposed to be a visit to Ukrainians, not to Yanukovych\". [3] This would show that European countries support the Ukrainian people and their democratic aspirations and even hope they may be eventually will join the European Union while showing displeasure at Yanukovych\u2019s policies and lack of support for democracy.

  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query about the boycott of Euro 2012 and its impact on Poland and Ukraine, this makes me think of the complex political landscape of Eastern Europe and how sports events can become entangled in geopolitical tensions. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the broader implications of such a boycott on international relations, democracy, and human rights, my initial impression is that the query is quite specific to the event itself. However, as I delve deeper, I realize the importance of considering the political climate, public opinion in both Ukraine and Poland, and the potential economic consequences of such a boycott.\n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here, but to approach this systematically, let me use the Conceptual Territory Mapping technique. This involves creating a detailed map of the knowledge landscape surrounding the topic, which should help in identifying key concepts, relationships, and areas of interest that might not be immediately apparent.\n\nFirst, I need to establish the central coordinates of the query. The core issue here is the proposed boycott of Euro 2012 and its intended targets, notably Yanukovych's regime and potentially the Ukrainian representation in the tournament. The cardinal directions for exploration seem to be political (focusing on pro-boycott vs. pro-tournament arguments), social (examining Ukrainian public opinion and Polish perspectives), and practical considerations (such as economic impact and international relations). The scale for this exploration appears to be medium-grained, focusing on key players, arguments, and potential consequences.\n\nAs I explore the boundaries of this conceptual territory, I chart the immediate territory of the query, which includes Ukrainian and Polish politics, international diplomacy, and economic consequences. Neighboring domains and disciplines that come into play include human rights, democracy, and geopolitical strategies. Notably, areas where these territories overlap or connect involve the intersection of sports with politics and the role of international events in shaping public opinion and policy.\n\nPlotting major landmarks within this territory, key concepts include the figures of Viktor Yanukovych and Yulia Timoshenko, the political movement Front for Change, and the broader context of European Union membership aspirations for Ukraine. Settlements or communities of practice that are relevant include human rights organizations, political analysts, and international relations theorists. Routes or methodologies that are useful for navigating this landscape involve understanding electoral processes, the impact of political polarization, and the strategies employed by governments and international bodies to address democracy and human rights concerns.\n\nFilling in the detail features within each region, I note the specialized terminology such as \"narrow margin election victory,\" \"allegations of electoral fraud,\" \"democracy and human rights concerns,\" and \"economic dependence on Russia.\" These terms provide a precise vocabulary for discussing the nuances of the situation.\n\nCreating a cartographic legend, or a lexicon of the most important terms, helps in selecting navigation terms that would be most useful for someone trying to understand the impact of a Euro 2012 boycott. Terms like \"boycott,\" \"Euro 2012,\" \"Ukraine,\" \"Poland,\" \"Yanukovych,\" \"Timoshenko,\" \"democracy,\" \"international relations,\" \"politics,\" and \"economy\" emerge as crucial for navigating this knowledge landscape.\n\nThrough this process of applying Conceptual Territory Mapping and exploring related threads, I believe the terms that would be most effective for understanding the query are those that capture the political, social, and economic dimensions of the boycott and its implications. These include not just the explicit terms related to the event and its key figures but also the implicit aspects that touch on democracy, human rights, and international relations.\n\nThus, the final expanded query that encapsulates the complexity of the issue could be: \"Assessing the political, social, and economic impact of a boycott of Euro 2012 in Ukraine, including its effects on Polish-Ukrainian relations, the democratic aspirations of the Ukrainian people, and the broader geopolitical landscape of Eastern Europe.\"",
