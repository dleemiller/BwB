  "query": "Technology will lead job growth for youths.  The rate of unemployment in Sub-Saharan Africa remains above the global average, at 7.55% in 2011, with 77% of the population in vulnerable employment [1] . Economic growth has not been inclusive and jobs are scarce. In particular, rates of youth unemployment, and underemployment, remain a concern [2] . On average, the underutilisation of youths in the labour market across Sub-Saharan Africa stood at 67% in 2012 (Work4Youth, 2013). Therefore 67% of youths are either unemployed, inactive, or in irregular employment. The rate of unemployment varies geographically and across gender [3] .  There remains a high percentage of youths within informal employment. Technology can introduce a new dynamic within the job market and access to safer employment.  Secure, high quality jobs, and more jobs, are essential for youths. Access to technology is the only way to meet such demands. Technology will enable youths to create new employment opportunities and markets; but also employment through managing, and selling, the technology available.  [1] ILO, 2013.  [2] Definitions: Unemployment is defined as the amount of people who are out of work despite being available, and seeking, work. Underemployment defines a situation whereby the productive capacity of an employed person is underutilised. Informal employment defines individuals working in waged and/or self employment informally (see further readings).  [3] Work4Youth (2013) show, on average, Madagascar has the lowest rate of unemployment (2.2%) while Tanzania has the highest (42%); and the average rate of female unemployment stands higher at 25.3%, in contrast to men (20.2%).",

This technique should help because it allows us to systematically explore the relationships between concepts and identify relevant terms that can enhance the query.\n\nFirst, let's identify the core concepts and entities in the original query. These include \"technology,\" \"youth,\" \"employment,\" \"Sub-Saharan Africa,\" and \"job growth.\" The search intent appears to be informational, as the user is seeking specific examples and analysis of technologies and initiatives that can address youth unemployment in the region.\n\nNext, let's construct a conceptual graph with these core nodes and their first-order and second-order connections. The graph will include nodes for digital skills, mobile technology, e-commerce, renewable energy, and agricultural technology, among others, as these are all related to the potential of technology to create employment opportunities for youths.\n\nFor expansion path selection, I'll identify promising directions such as synonymous terms, hierarchical terms, compositional terms, contextual terms, and domain-specific terminology. For example, synonymous terms could include \"job creation,\" \"career development,\" and \"vocational training,\" while hierarchical terms might include \"information technology,\" \"communication technology,\" and \"clean technology.\"\n\nAs I traverse the graph, I'll extract high-value terms and filter them based on relevance, distinctiveness, specificity, and searchability. Some potential expansion terms that emerge from this process include \"digital skills training,\" \"mobile technology entrepreneurship,\" \"e-commerce platforms,\" \"renewable energy jobs,\" and \"agricultural technology initiatives.\"\n\nNow, let's consider some of the natural thought patterns that are emerging as I work through this process. One thing that strikes me is the importance of digital skills in preparing youths for technology-related jobs. This makes me think of the need for digital skills training programs, which could be a key component of initiatives to address youth unemployment in Sub-Saharan Africa. Another thought that occurs to me is the potential for mobile technology to enable entrepreneurship and job creation, particularly in rural or underserved areas where traditional employment opportunities may be scarce.\n\nAs I continue to traverse the graph and extract expansion terms, I'm also starting to see some connections between the different concepts and nodes. For example, the idea of e-commerce platforms as a way to empower youths and create employment opportunities is closely related to the concept of digital skills training, as youths will need to have the necessary skills to participate in e-commerce platforms and take advantage of the opportunities they offer.\n\nThrough this process of applying the Conceptual Graph Traversal technique and exploring related threads, I believe that the following terms would be most effective for expanding the query: \"digital skills,\" \"mobile technology,\" \"e-commerce,\" \"renewable energy,\" \"agricultural technology,\" \"",
