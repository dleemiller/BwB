  "query": "Rich and poor now face equality of impact of punishment  The purpose of a fine is to ensure that the offender faces the consequences of their actions. The extent to which a financial penalty feels like a negative consequence is relative to the amount of income someone has, not to the simple amount that the fine is. That is, if someone earning \u00a3200 per week is fined \u00a3100, that will feel more severe than a \u00a3100 fine would feel to someone earning \u00a32000 per week.  Therefore, if you make fines proportional to the income someone has, all people feel the impact of the punishment equally, rather than the poor facing a punishment with a harsher impact on them than on the rich.",

  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query about the fairness of fines and their impact on individuals based on income levels, this makes me think of how different punishments can affect people in various ways, though the user might actually be trying to understand the concept of proportionate punishment and explore alternatives to fines. The query raises important points about economic inequality and the need for a justice system that takes into account the financial situation of offenders. \n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here, but to approach this systematically, let me use the expansion technique that involves applying specific guidelines: being specific and diverse, applying varied augmentation techniques such as synonym replacement, conceptual expansion, contextual expansion, and using domain-specific terminology. This should help because it allows for a broad yet targeted exploration of the topic, ensuring the introduction of new dimensions without overlapping the original terms.\n\nFollowing the expansion technique approach, I first examined the original query to understand its primary objectives and gaps. The main goal seems to be understanding how to make fines fairer by considering the income of offenders, but there's a gap in exploring alternative sentencing options and policy proposals. \n\nThen, I identified broad or non-precise terms that should be avoided, such as \"impact,\" \"purpose,\" \"extent,\" and \"feel,\" as they are too generic and don't add specificity to the search.\n\nNext, I proceeded with breadth expansion, listing candidate terms with increasingly distant concepts to the original query. Terms like \"community service,\" \"restorative justice,\" \"asset forfeiture,\" \"economic inequality,\" \"criminal justice reform,\" \"sentencing guidelines,\" and \"prison abolition\" come to mind. These terms expand the scope of the query by introducing different aspects of the justice system and societal factors that influence fairness in punishment.\n\nAfter that, I chose one distant but important topic from the breadth expansion, which is \"restorative justice,\" and went increasingly deeper into related terms on that topic. This led to considering \"alternatives to incarceration,\" \"rehabilitation programs,\" \"social impact bonds,\" \"employment training,\" \"housing assistance,\" and \"poverty reduction initiatives.\" These terms not only delve deeper into the concept of restorative justice but also connect it with broader social issues and potential solutions.\n\nApplying the technique systematically and allowing for natural thought patterns and intuitive connections, I realized that terms like \"community service\" and \"asset forfeiture\" could also serve as bridges between the original query and the deeper exploration of alternatives to fines. The depth expansion into \"rehabilitation programs\" and related terms like \"employment training\" and \"housing assistance\" provides a nuanced understanding of how to support offenders in a way that addresses the root causes of criminal behavior, particularly in the context of economic inequality.\n\nThrough this process of applying the expansion technique and exploring related threads, I believe the terms that would be most effective for an augmented query are those that capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking. The final augmented query should reflect a balance of specificity, diversity, and relevance to the original query's objectives.\n\nThe final step involves synthesizing the insights gained from both the structured approach and natural thought patterns. By considering the primary objectives of understanding proportionate punishment, exploring alternative sentencing options, and identifying policy proposals for fairer fines, and combining these with the expanded terms, the resulting query should effectively guide a search towards relevant and novel documents across various domains.",
