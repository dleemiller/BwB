  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"What is it like to be a Psychology student (undergrad) at UCL?\", this makes me think of the various aspects of student life, academic rigor, and research opportunities that might be unique to UCL's Psychology program. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the academic environment, student support services, and the overall experience of being a Psychology undergraduate at UCL, the query is too broad and general. I need to focus on making it more specific and targeted to UCL's Psychology program.\n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here, but to approach this systematically, I'll use the expansion technique provided, which involves identifying ineffective terms, performing breadth expansion, and then depth expansion. This should help because it allows me to methodically explore related concepts and terms that can enhance the query without overlapping with the original terms.\n\nFirst, I identify \"what is it like\" and \"student\" as ineffective terms because they are too general and don't add much specificity to the query. Then, for breadth expansion, I consider terms like \"UCL academics\", \"university resources\", \"research projects\", \"London student life\", and \"psychology department\" to introduce new dimensions to the query. This step is crucial as it opens up the query to a wider range of relevant topics without being too generic.\n\nFor depth expansion, I choose \"psychology department\" as a starting point and delve deeper into related terms such as \"department culture\", \"faculty expertise\", \"research labs\", \"student societies\", and \"clinical placements\". This process allows me to uncover more specific and relevant terms that can significantly enhance the query. Applying the depth expansion technique, I realize that terms like \"research labs\" and \"faculty expertise\" are particularly valuable as they directly relate to the academic and research aspects of UCL's Psychology program.\n\nAs I apply the expansion technique, I also consider synonym replacement and conceptual expansion to further enrich the query. For instance, instead of just \"research labs\", I might include terms related to specific areas of psychology research at UCL, such as \"cognitive neuroscience\" or \"clinical psychology\". This step ensures that the query captures a wide range of relevant concepts and terms.\n\nOccasionally, I find myself making connections between the original query and the expanded terms that weren't immediately obvious. For example, considering \"London student life\" leads me to think about the unique experiences and opportunities available to Psychology students at UCL due to its location in London, such as access to a diverse population for research or internship opportunities in mental health services.\n\nStepping back to reassess, I realize that the key to a successful expansion is striking a balance between staying true to the original query's intent and introducing new, relevant terms that can attract a broader range of high-quality search results. By focusing on specific aspects of UCL's Psychology program and the experiences of its undergraduate students, I aim to create an augmented query that is both targeted and diverse.\n\nThrough this process of applying the expansion technique and exploring related threads, I believe the terms that would be most effective for an augmented query are those that reflect the depth expansion, particularly terms related to the psychology department, research opportunities, and student life at UCL. These terms capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking and are likely to yield more precise and relevant search results.",
