  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"Roughly how many take up PESSAT exam?\", this makes me think of statistical data and educational metrics, though the user might actually be trying to understand the popularity or competitiveness of the PESSAT exam. I'm seeing several possibilities here, but the original query is quite broad and doesn't specify what kind of data or statistics the user is looking for. Let me approach this using the expansion technique, which involves systematically analyzing the query's goals, identifying ineffective terms, and then applying breadth and depth expansion to find more specific and relevant search terms.\n\nThe primary objective of the query is to identify the number of PESSAT exam takers, which suggests we need to focus on terms related to student demographics, exam registration, and educational statistics. The term \"roughly\" seems too vague and doesn't add much value to the search, so it's best to avoid it in our expanded query. \n\nFollowing the expansion technique, I'll start by examining the breadth of possible terms that could be related to the query. This includes student demographics, exam registration, educational statistics, and PESSAT enrollment trends. However, to really dive deep and find specific data, I need to choose one of these areas and expand on it. Enrollment trends seem particularly promising because they directly relate to the number of students taking the exam and can provide insight into the exam's popularity over time.\n\nNow, let's apply the depth expansion to \"enrollment trends\". This involves looking at more specific terms like PESSAT student population, examination board statistics, and even broader terms like India education data. The idea is to find terms that are both specific and diverse, offering a novel perspective on the original query without overlapping with the original terms. \n\nAs I delve into the depth expansion, I notice that terms like \"student population\" and \"examination board statistics\" are closely related and could provide the specific data the user is looking for. However, to ensure our search is comprehensive, we should also consider the broader context of India's education system, as this could influence PESSAT enrollment trends.\n\nThrough this process of applying the expansion technique and exploring related threads, I believe the terms that would be most effective for a BM25 index are those that capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking. Thus, focusing on \"student population PESSAT India examination board statistics\" seems like a solid approach. It encapsulates the core of the query while providing enough specificity to yield relevant results.",
