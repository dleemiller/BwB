  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query \"What are some good resources to learn Tagalog?\", my first impression is that the user is seeking practical information on how to learn the Tagalog language. This makes me think of various resources such as online courses, language learning apps, textbooks, and even language exchange programs. However, the user's intent is more focused on finding resources rather than engaging in discussions, which indicates that the current results are not relevant.\n\nTo approach this, I'll use the expansion technique provided, which involves discovering new, relevant documents across various domains. The goal is to create an augmented query that is novel and free from overlapping the original terms. Starting with the original query, I notice that terms like \"good\" and \"resources\" are quite broad and non-precise, which could lead to ineffective search results. These terms should be avoided in the augmented query.\n\nThe next step is to apply breadth expansion by introducing new dimensions to the query. This involves listing candidate terms with increasingly distant concepts to the original query. Some of these terms could be \"online courses\", \"language apps\", \"textbooks\", \"immersion programs\", \"language exchange\", \"cultural centers\", and \"universities\". These terms start to diversify the search query, moving away from the generic term \"resources\".\n\nFor depth expansion, I choose one distant but important topic from the breadth expansion, which is \"online courses\". Then, I go increasingly deeper into related terms on this topic, such as \"interactive learning platforms\", \"Duolingo\", \"Memrise\", \"structured lessons\", \"vocabulary building\", \"grammar exercises\", and \"pronunciation guides\". This depth expansion provides more specific and targeted terms that can enhance the search query.\n\nAs I apply the expansion technique, I notice that the process involves a systematic approach to identifying gaps in the original query, avoiding broad terms, and introducing new concepts through breadth and depth expansion. However, it's also important to allow for natural thought patterns, such as reconsidering the effectiveness of certain terms or making intuitive connections between concepts.\n\nThrough this process, I realize that the augmented query should include terms that are not only relevant but also diverse and targeted. The terms \"online courses\", \"Duolingo\", \"Memrise\", \"structured lessons\", \"vocabulary building\", \"grammar exercises\", and \"pronunciation guides\" emerge as high-quality search terms that capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking.\n\nBy balancing the structured approach with natural cognitive patterns, I'm able to create an augmented query that is novel, diverse, and relevant to the original query. The final augmented query is \"online courses Duolingo Memrise structured lessons vocabulary building grammar exercises pronunciation guides\".",
