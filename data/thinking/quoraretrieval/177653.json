  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"What are the monomers of lipids?\"... this makes me think of biochemistry and the basic building blocks of cells. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the composition of lipids, I'm not sure yet if they're looking for a specific type of lipid or a general overview.\n\nTo tackle this, I'll use the Conceptual Graph Traversal technique for query expansion. This involves analyzing the query, constructing a conceptual graph, selecting expansion paths, and extracting high-value terms. The goal is to enhance the search query with semantically relevant terms that improve document retrieval.\n\nFirst, I'll identify the core concepts and entities in the original query. Clearly, \"lipids\" and \"monomers\" are central. The search intent is informational, as the user seeks to understand or learn about the monomers of lipids. There's an implicit assumption that the user has some basic knowledge of biochemistry but needs more specific information on lipid composition.\n\nNext, I'll build a conceptual graph. The core nodes will be \"lipids\" and \"monomers.\" First-order connections include properties like \"fatty acids,\" \"glycerol,\" and \"phospholipids,\" as these are directly related to lipid structure. Second-order connections might involve broader concepts like \"cell membranes,\" \"biological processes,\" and \"biochemical pathways.\" The domain context is clearly biochemistry and molecular biology.\n\nFor expansion path selection, I'll consider several directions:\n- Synonymous terms: Could include \"building blocks of lipids\" or \"lipid constituents.\"\n- Hierarchical terms: Broader concepts like \"biomolecules\" or narrower concepts like \"phospholipid monomers.\"\n- Compositional terms: Parts of lipids, such as \"fatty acid chains\" or \"glycerol backbone.\"\n- Contextual terms: Settings where lipids play a critical role, such as \"cell membrane structure\" or \"lipid metabolism.\"\n- Domain-specific terminology: Terms like \"triglycerides,\" \"sterols,\" or \"sphingolipids\" that are specific to the field of biochemistry.\n\nExtracting and filtering terms, I'll focus on relevance, distinctiveness, specificity, and searchability. For example, terms like \"fatty acids,\" \"glycerol,\" and \"phospholipids\" are highly relevant and specific. They also have low lexical overlap with the original terms and are likely to appear in relevant documents. Other terms like \"cell membrane,\" \"lipid metabolism,\" and \"biochemical pathways\" provide contextual relevance and can help in retrieving documents that discuss lipids in a broader biological context.\n\nThrough this process, the expanded terms will include a mix of direct constituents of lipids, related biochemical concepts, and terms that provide context to the query. These terms maintain the original search intent while offering alternative pathways for document retrieval.\n\nThe final set of expanded terms could look something like this:\n- Fatty acids\n- Glycerol\n- Phospholipids\n- Triglycerides\n- Sterols\n- Sphingolipids\n- Cell membrane\n- Lipid metabolism\n- Biochemical pathways\n- Biomolecules\n- Lipid synthesis\n\nThese terms, when added to the original query, should provide a comprehensive and targeted search that captures both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking. The augmented query could be: \"What are the monomers of lipids, including fatty acids, glycerol, and phospholipids, in the context of cell membrane structure and lipid metabolism?\"\n\nThis approach ensures that the search query is enhanced with relevant terms that can lead to more accurate and informative results, aligning with the user's informational intent and providing a deeper understanding of lipid monomers within the context of biochemistry.",
