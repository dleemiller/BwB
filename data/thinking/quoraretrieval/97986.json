  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"Why do so many people hate Manchester United?\"... this makes me think of the complexities of sports fandom, the role of media in shaping public opinion, and the historical events that might have contributed to negative sentiment towards the club. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the underlying reasons for this phenomenon, the query itself is quite broad and doesn't specify what aspect of \"hate\" they're interested in. Hmm, not sure yet how to approach this without more context.\n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here... Let me approach this using the expansion technique, which involves systematically identifying ineffective terms, expanding the query through breadth and depth analyses, and applying techniques like synonym replacement, conceptual expansion, and domain-specific terminology. This should help because it allows us to introduce new dimensions to the query without overlapping with the original terms.\n\nStarting with the original query's objectives and gaps, it's clear that we need to delve into the specifics of why Manchester United is disliked by many. The terms \"hate\" and \"so many\" are too broad and non-precise, making them ineffective for a targeted search. For breadth expansion, we consider terms like \"rivalries,\" \"fan culture,\" \"football management,\" \"club finances,\" \"transfer market,\" \"legacy,\" \"media coverage,\" and \"social media influence.\" These terms begin to cover various aspects that could influence negative sentiment.\n\nTo go deeper, let's focus on \"fan culture\" as it's a distant but important topic related to the original query. Within fan culture, we can explore \"fandom dynamics,\" \"online fan communities,\" \"social media engagement,\" \"forum discussions,\" and \"critical analysis of fan perspectives.\" This depth expansion allows us to understand the nuances of how and why fans develop negative sentiments towards Manchester United.\n\nApplying the technique systematically, I consider how each step reveals new insights. The breadth expansion introduces new dimensions such as the impact of \"transfer market\" decisions and \"media coverage\" on public opinion. Meanwhile, the depth expansion into \"fan culture\" and its related terms helps in understanding the grassroots level of sentiment formation.\n\nI just had a realization that connects to what we were exploring earlier... The role of \"social media influence\" and \"online fan communities\" in shaping and expressing negative sentiments towards Manchester United could be pivotal. This makes me think that terms related to these concepts should be included in the augmented query.\n\nFollowing the technique pointed me toward \"critical analysis of fan perspectives,\" but my instinct says we should also consider the historical and current \"rivalries\" as a significant factor. This balance between structure and intuition is crucial as it ensures the augmented query captures both explicit and implicit aspects of the user's query.\n\nThrough this process of applying the expansion technique and exploring related threads, I believe the terms that would be most effective for the augmented query are those that reflect the depth expansion into fan culture and the breadth of factors influencing sentiment. Thus, focusing on terms like \"rivalries,\" \"fandom dynamics,\" \"online fan communities,\" \"critical analysis,\" \"media coverage,\" and \"transfer market\" will provide a comprehensive and novel approach to understanding the original query.",
