  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"What can I do to get more energy?\"... this makes me think of various aspects that could be influencing the user's energy levels, such as physical health, mental well-being, and emotional state. Though the user might actually be trying to address a specific area, like improving their physical energy or boosting their mental focus, the query is broad and lacks specificity. Initially, I'm considering how to narrow down the scope while also exploring relevant concepts that could provide comprehensive advice.\n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here... Let me approach this using the expansion technique, which involves identifying the primary objectives of the query, pinpointing ineffective terms, expanding the query breadth, and then diving deeper into a selected area. This should help because it systematically breaks down the query into manageable parts, allowing for a more targeted and diverse set of search terms.\n\nStarting with goal elucidation, the user seems to be seeking advice on increasing energy levels, but the query doesn't specify if it's about physical, mental, or emotional energy. The ineffective term here is \"What,\" as it's too broad and doesn't add much value to the search query. For breadth expansion, I'm considering terms like \"productivity,\" \"sleep quality,\" \"nutrition,\" \"exercise,\" \"stress management,\" \"mindfulness,\" \"creativity,\" and \"focus techniques.\" These terms introduce new dimensions to the query, moving beyond the general concept of energy.\n\nNow, let's dive into depth expansion. Choosing \"nutrition\" as a key area, I start to explore related terms that could provide specific and actionable advice. This leads me to consider \"healthy eating habits,\" \"vitamins and minerals,\" \"protein sources,\" \"iron deficiency,\" and \"omega-3 fatty acids.\" Each of these terms offers a deeper insight into how nutrition can impact energy levels, providing a clear pathway to constructing a more effective search query.\n\nAs I apply the expansion technique, I'm also considering natural connections and intuition. For instance, the importance of \"focus techniques\" in boosting mental energy and how \"mindfulness\" can play a role in managing stress and improving mood. These intuitive leaps complement the structured approach, ensuring the expanded query captures both explicit and implicit aspects of the user's needs.\n\nThrough this process of applying the expansion technique and exploring related threads, I believe the terms that would be most effective for enhancing the search query are those that target specific areas of energy improvement, such as physical, mental, and emotional well-being, without overlapping with the original terms. The final augmented query should include terms like \"healthy eating habits,\" \"vitamins,\" \"minerals,\" \"protein,\" \"iron,\" \"omega-3,\" and \"focus techniques,\" providing a novel and diverse set of search terms that introduce new dimensions to the query.",
