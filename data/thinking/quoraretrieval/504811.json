  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"Does any airline use WhatsApp as a customer support tool?\"... this makes me think of how airlines interact with their customers, and whether WhatsApp is a common platform for this interaction. Though the user might actually be trying to find out if there's a specific airline that uses WhatsApp, or if this is a trend in the airline industry, I'm not sure yet.\n\nAs I start to break down the query, I realize that the term \"any\" is quite broad and might not be effective in yielding specific results. I need to focus on more targeted expansions that introduce new dimensions to the query. Let me approach this using the expansion technique provided, which involves being specific and diverse, and applying varied augmentation techniques such as synonym replacement, conceptual expansion, contextual expansion, and domain-specific terminology.\n\nI start by examining the primary objectives and gaps in the original query. The main goal is to identify airlines that offer WhatsApp support and determine if WhatsApp is a common customer service channel for airlines. However, the query lacks specificity and does not provide enough context for relevant results. The ineffective term \"any\" should be avoided, as it does not add much value to the search.\n\nFor breadth expansion, I consider terms that are increasingly distant from the original query, such as \"mobile messaging apps,\" \"airline communication channels,\" \"customer service platforms,\" \"online support tools,\" and \"digital customer engagement.\" These terms help to broaden the search and provide more context.\n\nNext, I focus on depth expansion, choosing one distant but important topic from the breadth expansion and going deeper into related terms. I select \"messaging app customer service\" and explore terms such as \"WhatsApp business features,\" \"airline industry trends,\" \"CRM software for airlines,\" and \"automated customer support solutions.\" This helps to narrow down the search and provide more specific results.\n\nAs I apply the expansion technique, I start to see connections between the original query and the expanded terms. The concept of WhatsApp business features, for instance, is closely related to the idea of airlines using WhatsApp for customer support. I also notice that CRM software for airlines is an important aspect of customer service, and automated customer support solutions could be a key area of interest for airlines looking to improve their customer engagement.\n\nThrough this process, I start to see insights emerging from both the structured approach and my natural thought patterns. Applying the expansion technique leads me to discover new terms such as \"WhatsApp business features\" and \"automated customer support solutions,\" which are highly relevant to the original query. My intuition also suggests that terms like \"airline CRM\" and \"digital customer engagement\" could be important in capturing the essence of the user's search.\n\nAfter carefully considering the expanded terms and avoiding ineffective words, I arrive at a final augmented query: \"whatsapp business features airline CRM automated customer support.\" This query is novel, diverse, and free from overlapping the original terms. It targets non-overlapping results from the original query and is contextually relevant to the user's search.",
