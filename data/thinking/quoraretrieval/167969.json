  "thought_process": "When I first look at the query \"How is ISIS funded and how do they operate?\", my initial impression is that this is a complex question that delves into the financial and operational mechanisms of a terrorist organization. The user is seeking a comprehensive understanding of how ISIS generates revenue and how it utilizes these funds to support its operations. This makes me think about the various aspects of terrorism financing, including international finance, black markets, and geopolitical factors.\n\nAs I begin to apply the journalistic investigation technique, I start by assessing what the user is truly seeking beneath the surface query. The user wants to understand the primary sources of ISIS funding, how the organization uses its funding to support operations, and the geographical areas where ISIS generates revenue. I also identify assumptions, knowledge gaps, and unexpressed needs, such as the user's potential interest in the organizational structure that facilitates ISIS's financial operations and the methods used to disrupt ISIS's funding streams.\n\nNext, I consider diverse real-world scenarios where this query is relevant, including professional contexts, educational settings, personal situations, and specialized communities. For instance, this query could be relevant in the context of counter-terrorism efforts, international relations, or financial regulation. I also think about the historical and evolving contexts of ISIS's funding and operations, including the impact of the organization's territorial losses and the use of cryptocurrency for fundraising.\n\nAs I investigate resources, I look for authoritative sources of information on this topic, including notable experts, established methodologies, and essential terminology. I identify key concepts, such as terrorist financing, shadow economy, and counter-terrorism financing, and I consider the role of organizations, institutions, and communities involved in addressing these issues.\n\nWhen creating headlines, I aim to introduce articles addressing the query from multiple angles, including beginner-oriented explanations, expert-level deep dives, practical application guides, comparative analyses, and historical or future-focused perspectives. Some possible headlines include \"ISIS's Financial Empire: Tracing the Terror Group's Billions\", \"The Shadow Economy of ISIS: Unraveling the Group's Financial Networks\", and \"Cryptocurrency and Jihad: ISIS's Embrace of Digital Finance\".\n\nAs I extract specific terms from these headlines, I focus on precise concepts related to the query, including terminology experts would use, related topics, and peripheral areas. I pull out terms like \"ISIS funding\", \"terrorist financing\", \"black market oil\", \"extortion rackets\", \"cryptocurrency\", \"hawala networks\", and \"money laundering\".\n\nThroughout this process, I balance structured steps with natural thought patterns, including occasional false starts, reconsiderations, and intuitive connections. For instance, when considering the role of cryptocurrency in ISIS's funding, I also think about the potential linkages between ISIS and organized crime networks. I step back to reassess my approach, ensuring that I'm capturing the complexity and nuance of the topic.\n\nAs insights emerge from both structure and intuition, I apply specific aspects of the journalistic investigation technique to discover new terms and concepts. For example, investigating terrorist financing leads me to consider the importance of UN sanctions and counter-terrorism financing efforts. I also realize that following the technique points me toward concepts like \"foreign terrorist fighters\" and \"virtual assets\", which are crucial in understanding ISIS's financial operations.\n\nThrough this process of applying the journalistic investigation technique and exploring related threads, I believe that the augmented query \"How is ISIS funded (oil, extortion, donations, cryptocurrency) and how do they operate (hawala, money laundering, virtual assets, black market)? Investigate terrorist financing, shadow economy, and counter-terrorism financing related to ISIS\" effectively captures the user's information needs. This query combines the original intent with valuable new terms, providing a comprehensive foundation for further research and investigation.",
