  "thought_process": "As I delve into the query \"What do you do when everything in life feels boring?\", my initial impression is that this is a deeply personal and existential question. It makes me think of the concept of ennui, a feeling of listlessness and dissatisfaction. The user might be experiencing a lack of purpose or meaning in their life, which is leading to this overwhelming sense of boredom. I'm also considering the possibility that the user is seeking practical advice on how to break out of a rut, rather than a philosophical exploration of boredom.\n\nTo approach this query, I'll utilize the Conceptual Graph Traversal technique. This involves constructing a conceptual graph that represents the relationships between the core concepts in the query. The core concepts here are \"boredom\", \"life\", and \"feeling\". I'll start by identifying the first-order connections, which include properties like \"lack of interest\", \"monotony\", and \"routine\". \n\nAs I build the graph, I notice that the concept of \"boredom\" has second-order connections to ideas like \"apathy\", \"demotivation\", and \"existential crisis\". This suggests that the user's boredom might be a symptom of a deeper issue, rather than just a surface-level problem. The domain context for this query appears to be psychology, self-help, and personal development.\n\nFor expansion path selection, I've identified four promising directions: \n\n1. **Synonymous terms**: Words like \"apathy\", \"ennui\", and \"listlessness\" that convey a similar sense of emotional numbness.\n2. **Hierarchical terms**: Broader concepts like \"mental health\" and \"well-being\", as well as narrower concepts like \"leisure activities\" and \"hobby exploration\".\n3. **Compositional terms**: Components of a fulfilling life, such as \"purpose\", \"meaning\", and \"passion\".\n4. **Contextual terms**: Settings where boredom often occurs, like \"daily routine\", \"work-life balance\", and \"social connections\".\n\nNow, I'll extract high-value terms from each expansion path, filtering them based on relevance, distinctiveness, specificity, and searchability. Some potential expansion terms include \"find hobbies\", \"explore new interests\", \"seek therapy for apathy\", \"change daily routine\", \"set new goals\", \"practice mindfulness\", \"combat monotony\", \"rediscover passion\", \"find purpose\", and \"overcome existential boredom\".\n\nAs I consider these terms, I'm also thinking about how they relate to each other and to the original query. For instance, \"finding hobbies\" and \"exploring new interests\" might be ways to combat monotony and rediscover passion. Meanwhile, \"seeking therapy for apathy\" and \"practicing mindfulness\" could be approaches to addressing underlying mental health issues. \n\nBy combining these expansion terms with the original query, I aim to create an augmented query that captures the complexity and nuance of the user's question. The final expanded terms should provide a valuable starting point for retrieving relevant documents and helping the user find meaningful solutions to their problem.\n\nThrough this process of applying Conceptual Graph Traversal and exploring related threads, I believe the following terms would be most effective for query expansion: \"find hobbies\", \"explore new interests\", \"seek therapy for apathy\", \"change daily routine\", \"set new goals\", \"practice mindfulness\", \"combat monotony\", \"rediscover passion\", \"find purpose\", and \"overcome existential boredom\". These terms balance the need for practical advice with the importance of addressing deeper, existential concerns.",
