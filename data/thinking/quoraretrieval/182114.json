  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"What are the pros & cons of demonization?\"... this makes me think of various contexts in which \"demonization\" can occur, though the user might actually be trying to understand its economic implications, considering the current economic climate and geopolitical tensions. Hmm, not sure yet how to tease apart the different facets of \"demonization\" and its potential impacts.\n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here... Let me approach this using Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal, which involves constructing a graph of concepts related to the original query and then systematically exploring this graph to find relevant expansion terms. This should help because it allows us to methodically uncover various aspects of \"demonization\" and its pros and cons, potentially revealing terms that are highly relevant but not immediately apparent from the original query.\n\nFollowing the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal approach, I should first identify the core concepts and entities in the original query. Here, \"demonization,\" \"pros,\" and \"cons\" are central. The search intent seems informational, as the user is seeking to understand the advantages and disadvantages of demonization, likely in an economic context given the mention of \"economics\" in the augmented query.\n\nAs I build the conceptual graph, I'll include core nodes for \"demonization,\" \"economics,\" and the idea of \"pros and cons.\" First-order connections might involve the effects of demonization on markets, trade, and currency, as well as social and political impacts. Second-order connections could delve into historical examples of demonization, theoretical economic models that predict its outcomes, and international relations aspects. Domain contexts will include economics, politics, sociology, and history, as these fields provide the necessary depth to understand the multifaceted nature of demonization.\n\nNow, identifying promising directions for query expansion... I see several paths:\n- Synonymous terms for \"demonization\" in an economic context, such as \"economic sanctions\" or \"trade embargo.\"\n- Hierarchical terms, like broader concepts (\"globalization,\" \"international trade\") or narrower ones (\"tariffs,\" \"quotas\").\n- Compositional terms, which could involve the components of economic systems affected by demonization, such as \"markets,\" \"currency exchange,\" or \"investment.\"\n- Contextual terms, considering scenarios like \"financial crisis,\" \"recession,\" or \"political instability.\"\n- Domain-specific terminology from economics and international relations, such as \"protectionism,\" \"isolationism,\" or \"deregulation.\"\n\nFor each expansion path, I need to extract high-value terms and filter them based on relevance, distinctiveness, specificity, and searchability. This process will help refine the list to terms that are not only related to \"demonization\" and its economic pros and cons but also likely to appear in relevant documents, thus enhancing the search query's effectiveness.\n\nApplying this systematic approach and considering my intuitive understanding of how these concepts interrelate, I notice that terms like \"economic sanctions,\" \"tariffs,\" \"protectionism,\" and \"globalization\" emerge as strong candidates for query expansion. These terms capture the essence of demonization's economic aspects and its broader implications on international trade and relations.\n\nThrough this process of applying Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal and exploring related threads, I believe the following terms would be most effective for enhancing the original query: \"economic sanctions,\" \"trade embargo,\" \"tariffs,\" \"quotas,\" \"protectionism,\" \"globalization,\" \"international trade,\" \"financial crisis,\" \"recession,\" and \"political instability.\" These terms maintain the original search intent while providing valuable alternative pathways for document retrieval, especially in the context of economics and geopolitical analysis.\n\nThus, the expanded query could be: \"What are the pros and cons of economic demonization, considering economic sanctions, trade embargos, tariffs, quotas, protectionism, globalization, and the impacts on international trade during financial crises, recessions, and periods of political instability?\"",
