  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"Why do people think it's okay to touch a pregnant woman's stomach?\"... this makes me think of societal norms and personal boundaries, though the user might actually be trying to understand the cultural or historical context behind this behavior. Hmm, not sure yet... I need to delve deeper into the potential reasons and influences. \n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here... Let me approach this using the expansion technique, which involves applying specific guidelines such as being specific and diverse, and utilizing varied augmentation techniques like synonym replacement, conceptual expansion, and domain-specific terminology. This should help because it will allow me to systematically explore related concepts and identify new, relevant terms.\n\nFirst, I need to examine the original query to understand its primary objectives and gaps. The query seems to be exploring the social acceptability of touching a pregnant woman's stomach, which involves understanding societal norms, consent, and potential cultural influences. There appears to be a gap in understanding why people think this behavior is acceptable, which could be filled by exploring cultural customs, body boundaries, and gestational sensitivities.\n\nNext, I should identify broad or non-precise terms that should be avoided. Terms like \"okay\" and \"it's\" seem too generic and don't add much value to the query. I'll make sure to exclude these from the expanded query.\n\nNow, I'll move on to breadth expansion, where I list candidate terms with increasingly distant concepts to the original query. This includes terms like \"pregnancy customs,\" \"body boundaries,\" \"gestational sensitivities,\" \"cultural taboos,\" and \"social etiquette.\" These terms start to paint a picture of the complex factors influencing people's perceptions of touching a pregnant woman's stomach.\n\nFor depth expansion, I'll choose one distant but important topic from the breadth expansion and go increasingly deeper in the related terms. Let's see... \"cultural taboos\" seems like a fascinating area to explore further. This leads me to \"sacred pregnancy rituals,\" \"maternal body symbolism,\" \"ancient beliefs about fertility,\" and \"folklore surrounding childbirth.\" These terms reveal a rich cultural and historical context that could help explain why people think it's okay to touch a pregnant woman's stomach.\n\nAs I apply the expansion technique, I'm noticing that the terms from the depth expansion are particularly insightful. Applying the technique's steps systematically, I'm able to identify high-quality search terms that are unique, diverse, and relevant to the original query. I'm also making sure to omit any ineffective words or terms, even if they're included in the expanded terms.\n\nThrough this process of applying the expansion technique and exploring related threads, I believe the terms from the depth expansion, combined with additional high-relevance terms, would be most effective for an augmented query. These terms capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, providing a nuanced understanding of the social and cultural factors influencing people's behavior around touching a pregnant woman's stomach.\n\nThe final augmented query, \"pregnancy customs cultural taboos sacred rituals maternal symbolism folklore childbirth,\" emerges logically from both the technique and natural insights, providing a targeted and precise set of terms for searching.",
