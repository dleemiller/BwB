  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query \"How can I make my self physically strong?\"... this makes me think of various aspects of physical fitness, though the user might actually be trying to improve their overall health, endurance, or muscle mass. The query seems a bit vague, so I need to break it down into more specific and actionable components.\n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here... Let me approach this using the expansion technique, which involves examining the query's primary objectives, identifying ineffective terms, and then applying breadth and depth expansions to discover new, relevant terms. This should help because it allows me to systematically analyze the query, identify gaps, and introduce new dimensions to the search.\n\nStarting with goal elucidation, I realize the user wants to improve their physical strength, which could encompass resistance training, weightlifting, or bodyweight exercises. However, terms like \"self\" are too broad and don't add much value to the query. I should avoid using such ineffective terms in the expanded query.\n\nAs I move on to breadth expansion, I consider more distant concepts related to physical strength, such as nutrition for athletes, sports performance, and athletic development. These terms might seem unrelated at first, but they could provide valuable insights into the user's search query. For instance, understanding the relationship between diet and strength could be crucial for someone looking to improve their physical strength.\n\nNow, let's dive deeper into one of these topics. I choose \"resistance training\" as a starting point for depth expansion. Following the expansion technique, I should look into more specific aspects of resistance training, such as progressive overload, compound exercises, and training frequency. These terms are more targeted and relevant to the user's search query.\n\nAs I apply the technique, I notice that concepts like protein intake and carbohydrate timing are also essential for strength training. These terms might not be directly related to resistance training, but they complement the user's search query nicely. I should also consider the importance of rest and recovery in strength training, as well as the role of isolation exercises in a well-rounded workout routine.\n\nThrough this process of applying the expansion technique and exploring related threads, I believe the augmented query should include terms like \"resistance training,\" \"weightlifting,\" \"compound exercises,\" \"protein intake,\" \"carbohydrate timing,\" and \"progressive overload.\" These terms capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, providing a more comprehensive and targeted search query.\n\nThe final augmented query seems to be a good representation of the user's search intent, covering various aspects of physical strength and fitness. By combining the results of breadth and depth expansions, I've created a query that is both diverse and targeted, with a focus on non-overlapping results from the original query.",
