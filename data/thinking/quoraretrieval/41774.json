  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"Who is the genuine seller of Davisco Whey Protein in INDIA? Any user of Davisco Whey, Please come forward,\" this makes me think of the user's frustration in finding a reliable source for a specific product. Though the user might actually be trying to find a certified dealer to ensure the authenticity and quality of the whey protein, the query's current form might not directly lead to the desired outcome. The addition of \"Any user of Davisco Whey, Please come forward\" seems more like an appeal rather than a specific query component, which might not be effective in search results.\n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here... Let me approach this using the expansion technique provided, which involves being specific, diverse, and applying varied augmentation techniques such as synonym replacement, conceptual expansion, contextual expansion, and domain-specific terminology. This should help because it allows us to break down the query into its core objectives and then expand upon those in a structured yet innovative way.\n\nStarting with goal elucidation and gaps, the primary objective is to identify genuine sellers of Davisco Whey Protein in India. A significant gap in the original query is its broadness and the inclusion of ineffective terms like \"user\" and \"Please come forward,\" which do not contribute to the search for a specific seller.\n\nMoving on to ineffective term identification, terms like \"user\" and \"Please come forward\" should be avoided as they are too broad or non-precise. These terms could lead to irrelevant results that do not pertain to finding a genuine seller of Davisco Whey Protein.\n\nFor breadth expansion, candidate terms could include \"fitness supplements,\" \"sports nutrition stores,\" \"online health marketplaces,\" \"protein powder brands,\" \"import-export businesses,\" \"consumer protection agencies,\" and \"dairy product suppliers.\" These terms expand the query to cover various aspects related to the product and its potential sources.\n\nHowever, to truly find relevant results, depth expansion is crucial. Choosing \"import-export businesses\" as a distant but important topic, we can delve deeper into related terms such as \"foreign trade regulations,\" \"FDA approval for food imports,\" \"Davisco Whey Protein distributorships,\" \"Indian bodybuilding federations,\" \"certified online retailers,\" and \"customer testimonials for whey protein sellers.\" This depth expansion allows us to target the query more precisely towards finding legitimate and certified sellers of Davisco Whey Protein in India.\n\nApplying the expansion technique systematically and considering natural cognitive patterns, I notice that focusing on \"import-export businesses\" and then diving into \"foreign trade regulations\" and \"FDA approval\" provides a strong foundation for ensuring the product's authenticity and compliance with regulations. This step of the technique is revealing insights into the legal and regulatory aspects of importing food products, which actually reminds me of the importance of \"consumer protection agencies\" in overseeing these imports. I need to consider the next step in the technique, which involves looking into \"Davisco Whey Protein distributorships\" and \"certified online retailers,\" but I'm also noticing this interesting pattern where \"Indian bodybuilding federations\" and \"customer testimonials\" could provide valuable insights into trusted sellers within the community.\n\nThrough this process of applying the expansion technique and exploring related threads, I believe the following terms would be most effective for the augmented query: \"Davisco Whey Protein FDA approved import-export businesses distributorships Indian bodybuilding federations certified online retailers customer testimonials.\" These terms capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking\u2014authenticity, reliability, and compliance, all within the context of finding a genuine seller of Davisco Whey Protein in India.",
