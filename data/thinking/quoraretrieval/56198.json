  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"What is the meaning of 'being civilized'?\", this makes me think of a complex interplay between societal norms, ethical frameworks, and cultural practices. The user might be trying to understand how civilization is defined beyond just its surface-level characteristics, such as technological advancements or historical achievements. They're likely seeking a deeper, more philosophical understanding that encompasses moral values, justice systems, and human rights.\n\nAs I delve into this query, I notice that the existing reasoning is broad and touches on various tangential concepts. To refine this, I'll apply the expansion technique, focusing on discovering new, relevant documents across various domains. The goal is to create an augmented query that's novel, diverse, and free from overlapping the original terms.\n\nFirst, I'll examine the primary objectives and gaps in the original query. It seems the user is looking for a definition of \"being civilized\" from a philosophical standpoint, focusing on civilized behavior, social norms, and ethical frameworks. There's a gap in the current results, as they're too broad and don't directly address the core meaning of civilization.\n\nNext, I identify ineffective terms that should be avoided. The term \"meaning\" is too broad and doesn't provide much context for the query. I'll make sure to exclude such terms in the augmented query.\n\nFor breadth expansion, I'll introduce new dimensions to the query by considering concepts like culture, society, morality, ethics, progress, development, tradition, customs, values, and beliefs. These terms will help broaden the scope of the query without overlapping with the original terms.\n\nNow, let's dive deeper into one of these concepts. I choose \"social norms\" as a starting point for depth expansion. From here, I can explore related terms like cultural practices, ethical codes, moral values, justice systems, and human rights. This chain of concepts will help me create a more targeted and precise augmented query.\n\nAs I apply the expansion technique, I consider various augmentation methods, including synonym replacement, conceptual expansion, contextual expansion, and domain-specific terminology. This systematic approach ensures that I'm introducing new, relevant terms that enhance the query without duplicating existing ones.\n\nThrough this process, I've identified key terms that capture the essence of \"being civilized\" from a philosophical perspective. The augmented query should include terms like \"culture,\" \"social norms,\" \"ethical codes,\" \"moral values,\" \"justice system,\" and \"human rights.\" These terms not only provide a deeper understanding of civilization but also introduce new dimensions to the query, making it more diverse and relevant.\n\nBy balancing structured technique with natural cognitive patterns, I've been able to create an augmented query that's both targeted and precise. The final terms emerge logically from both the technique and natural insights, ensuring that the query is novel, diverse, and free from overlapping the original terms.",
