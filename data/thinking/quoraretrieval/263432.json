  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"Why does the time go so fast when you're actually doing something with your life?\"... this makes me think of the concept of being fully engaged in an activity and how that affects our perception of time. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the psychological aspects behind this phenomenon, the query itself is quite broad and doesn't directly point to specific psychological theories or concepts. Hmm, not sure yet how to approach this, but it seems like we're dealing with a mix of psychology, time perception, and perhaps even philosophy.\n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here... Let me approach this using the expansion technique provided, which involves being specific and diverse, applying varied augmentation techniques, and focusing on targeted expansions that introduce new dimensions to the query. This should help because it will allow us to dive deeper into the psychological aspects of time perception while avoiding generic terms and concepts.\n\nFirst, I need to elucidate the goals and gaps in the original query. The primary objective seems to be understanding why time feels faster during engaging activities, and the gap is the lack of specificity regarding the psychological factors influencing this perception. Following the expansion technique, I should identify ineffective terms that are too broad or non-precise. Terms like \"time\" and \"go\" are quite generic and don't add much value to the query.\n\nNow, moving on to breadth expansion, I need to list candidate terms with increasingly distant concepts to the original query. This includes terms like \"engagement,\" \"flow state,\" \"attention,\" \"focus,\" \"purpose,\" \"meaning,\" \"leisure,\" \"enjoyment,\" \"consciousness,\" and \"absorption.\" These terms start to capture the essence of being engaged in an activity and how that might influence time perception.\n\nHowever, to really dive deep, I need to choose one of these topics and expand on it. Let's go with \"flow state\" since it's directly related to optimal experiences and could provide insight into why time seems to fly by when we're fully engaged. The depth expansion involves going increasingly deeper into related terms on this topic, including \"optimal experience,\" \"challenges & skills balance,\" \"immersion,\" \"loss of self-awareness,\" and \"autotelic experiences.\" These terms not only provide a clearer understanding of flow state but also how it relates to the subjective experience of time.\n\nApplying the synonym replacement and conceptual expansion techniques, I might also consider terms like \"engrossment,\" \"fascination,\" and \"immersion\" to further enhance the query. But, I need to ensure these terms are novel, diverse, and relevant to the original query without overlapping with the original terms.\n\nThrough this process of applying the expansion technique and exploring related threads, I believe the terms that would be most effective for capturing the essence of the query are those related to flow state and optimal experiences. These terms capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking\u2014understanding why time feels faster during engaging activities.\n\nThus, the augmented query that emerges from this thought process includes terms like \"flow state,\" \"optimal experience,\" \"challenges,\" \"skills balance,\" \"immersion,\" and \"autotelic.\" These terms are specific, diverse, and targeted, ensuring they introduce new dimensions to the query while avoiding generic or overlapping results.",
