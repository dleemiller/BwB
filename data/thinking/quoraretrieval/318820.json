  "thought_process": "As I delve into the query \"What is it like to be an IITian?\", my initial impressions are that this is a deeply personal and subjective query. It's not just about facts and figures regarding IITs, but about the human experience, emotions, and the social environment within these institutions. The existing reasoning provided highlights the importance of capturing the personal, emotional, and social aspects of being an IITian, which current search results seem to miss.\n\nTo tackle this, I'm going to apply the \"Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal\" technique. This involves several steps: query analysis, graph construction, expansion path selection, and term extraction and filtering. The goal is to enhance the search query by discovering semantically relevant terms that will improve document retrieval.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the query. The core concepts here are \"IITian\", \"experience\", \"feeling\", \"culture\", \"life\", \"students\", \"academy\", and \"environment\". The search intent is informational, aiming to understand what it's like to be an IITian. There are implicit assumptions about the importance of personal narratives, emotions, and the social context.\n\nNext, I construct a conceptual graph. The core nodes are the entities and concepts directly from the query. First-order connections include properties like \"challenges faced\", \"success stories\", and \"campus life\". Second-order connections might involve related concepts such as \"engineering education\", \"Indian education system\", and \"alumni networks\". Domain contexts include higher education, student life, and professional development.\n\nFor expansion path selection, I identify promising directions: synonymous terms (e.g., \"IIT experience\" vs. \"life as an IITian\"), hierarchical terms (broader concepts like \"engineering student life\" or narrower ones like \"hostel life at IIT\"), compositional terms (parts of the IIT experience, such as \"academic rigor\", \"extracurricular activities\"), contextual terms (settings like \"IIT campus\", \"Indian educational context\"), and domain-specific terminology (terms used within the IIT community).\n\nNow, I extract high-value terms for each path. For synonymous terms, I consider \"IIT life\", \"IIT experience\", and \"being an IITian\". For hierarchical terms, \"engineering student culture\" and \"academic environment at IITs\" are relevant. Compositional terms might include \"academics\", \"social life\", and \"personal growth\". Contextual terms could be \"IIT Delhi\", \"IIT Bombay\", and \"Indian engineering colleges\". Domain-specific terms might include \"JEE preparation\", \"IIT placements\", and \"IIT alumni network\".\n\nFiltering these terms based on relevance, distinctiveness, specificity, and searchability, I select a final set of expansion terms. These include \"IIT life\", \"engineering student culture\", \"academics at IIT\", \"social environment\", \"personal growth stories\", \"IIT Delhi experience\", \"challenges faced by IITians\", \"success stories of IIT graduates\", \"Indian engineering education\", and \"IIT alumni network\".\n\nFinally, synthesizing these insights, I believe the expanded query should capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what it's like to be an IITian. This includes personal experiences, emotions, student life, culture, and the social environment at IITs.\n\nThe original query was \"What is it like to be an IITian?\", and through this process, I've identified core concepts and selected expansion paths to create a more comprehensive and nuanced query. The expanded terms maintain the original search intent while providing alternative pathways for retrieval, enhancing the chances of finding relevant and meaningful results.",
