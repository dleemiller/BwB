  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"What are some examples of technology developed in Ancient Rome?\"... this makes me think of aqueducts, roads, and maybe some engineering feats like the Colosseum. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the broader scope of Roman technological advancements, not just the obvious ones. Hmm, not sure yet... I need to break it down further.\n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here... Let me approach this using the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal technique, which involves analyzing the query, constructing a conceptual graph, and then traversing it to find relevant expansion terms. This should help because it allows me to systematically explore related concepts and identify high-value terms that can enhance the query.\n\nFirst, I'll identify the core concepts and entities in the original query. These seem to be \"technology,\" \"Ancient Rome,\" and the implicit concept of \"inventions\" or \"engineering feats.\" The search intent here is clearly informational, with the user seeking specific examples. There's an implicit assumption that Ancient Roman technology is distinct from other ancient civilizations, which might be worth exploring.\n\nNow, let's construct the conceptual graph. The core nodes are \"Ancient Rome\" and \"Technology.\" First-order connections include \"inventions,\" \"engineering,\" and \"materials,\" as these are direct attributes of technology. Second-order connections could be \"Greek Technology\" (as a comparative or influential factor), \"Roman Architecture,\" and \"Technological History\" (to understand the broader context). Domain contexts include history, engineering, and archaeology.\n\nFor expansion path selection, I'll consider synonymous terms (like \"innovations\" for \"technology\"), hierarchical terms (such as \"civil engineering\" under \"technology\"), compositional terms (parts of Roman technology, like \"water supply systems\"), contextual terms (settings where Roman technology was applied, such as \"urban planning\"), and domain-specific terminology (like \"concrete\" in the context of Roman construction).\n\nLet's extract and filter terms for each path. For synonymous terms, \"innovations\" and \"developments\" could work. Hierarchical terms might include \"civil engineering,\" \"mechanical engineering,\" and \"materials science.\" Compositional terms could be \"aqueducts,\" \"roads,\" and \"bridges.\" Contextual terms might include \"urban,\" \"military,\" and \"agricultural\" applications. Domain-specific terms could be \"Roman concrete,\" \"arches,\" and \"vaults.\"\n\nAs I apply the technique, I'm noticing that some terms are more relevant than others. For instance, \"civil engineering\" is very pertinent because it directly relates to many of the technological achievements of Ancient Rome, such as aqueducts and roads. Similarly, \"Roman concrete\" is a distinctive and specific term that could lead to valuable information about Roman construction techniques.\n\nI just had a realization that connects to what we were exploring earlier... the concept of \"technological history\" could provide a broader context, helping to understand how Roman technology fits into the timeline of human innovation. This could also lead to comparisons with other civilizations, which might be useful for a comprehensive understanding.\n\nThrough this process of applying the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal technique and exploring related threads, I believe the following terms would be most effective for expanding the query: \"innovations,\" \"civil engineering,\" \"Roman concrete,\" \"aqueducts,\" \"roads,\" \"urban planning,\" \"agricultural technology,\" \"military engineering,\" \"arches,\" and \"vaults.\" These terms capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, from specific examples of technology to the broader contexts in which they were developed and used.",
