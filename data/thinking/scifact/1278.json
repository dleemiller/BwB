  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"The treatment of cancer patients with co-IR blockade does not cause any adverse autoimmune events,\" my initial impression is that this is a very specific medical query focusing on the safety aspect of a particular cancer treatment method. The user is interested in understanding whether co-IR blockade, a form of immunotherapy, leads to autoimmune events. This makes me think about the broader context of cancer treatment, the role of immunotherapy, and how co-inhibitory blockade works. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the safety profile of this treatment, there seems to be an underlying question about the mechanisms of immunotherapy and its potential side effects.\n\nTransitioning to a structured approach, I'll be using the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal technique. This technique involves analyzing the query, constructing a conceptual graph, selecting expansion paths, extracting terms, and finally filtering these terms based on their relevance, distinctiveness, specificity, and searchability. The goal here is to enhance the query by finding semantically relevant terms that improve document retrieval.\n\nStarting with query analysis, the core concepts are \"cancer treatment,\" \"co-IR blockade,\" and \"autoimmune events.\" The search intent is informational, aiming to understand the relationship between a specific medical treatment and its potential side effects. Implicit assumptions include the importance of safety in cancer treatments and the relevance of co-IR blockade in this context.\n\nBuilding the conceptual graph, I identify \"cancer treatment,\" \"immunotherapy,\" \"co-inhibitory blockade,\" \"autoimmune events,\" and \"side effects\" as core nodes. First-order connections include the relationship between cancer treatment and immunotherapy, the mechanism of co-inhibitory blockade, and the potential for autoimmune events as side effects. Second-order connections involve related concepts like the immune system's role in cancer, different types of immunotherapy, and the specific checkpoints involved in co-inhibitory blockade, such as PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4.\n\nFor expansion path selection, I identify several promising directions: \n- Synonymous terms, such as \"cancer therapy\" or \"immuno-oncology,\"\n- Hierarchical terms, including \"oncology\" as a broader concept and \"checkpoint inhibitors\" as a narrower concept,\n- Compositional terms, like \"immune checkpoint inhibitors\" as parts of immunotherapy,\n- Contextual terms, including \"clinical trials\" or \"treatment outcomes,\" which provide settings for the query,\n- Domain-specific terminology, such as \"immunomodulatory therapy\" or \"cancer immunotherapy.\"\n\nExtracting and filtering terms, I consider their relevance, distinctiveness, specificity, and searchability. High-value terms might include \"immunotherapy side effects,\" \"cancer immunotherapy safety,\" \"checkpoints and autoimmunity,\" \"PD-1/PD-L1 blockade,\" \"CTLA-4 blockade,\" \"oncology treatments,\" \"immuno-oncology therapies,\" \"immune system modulation,\" and \"clinical trial outcomes.\"\n\nAs I apply the technique and explore related threads, insights emerge from both the structured approach and my intuition. The technique helps in systematically uncovering relevant terms, while my natural thought process connects these terms to the broader context of cancer treatment and immunotherapy. I realize that terms like \"immunotherapy side effects\" and \"cancer immunotherapy safety\" are crucial because they directly address the user's concern about the safety profile of co-IR blockade in cancer treatment.\n\nThrough this process, I believe the following terms would be most effective for expansion: \"immunotherapy,\" \"cancer immunotherapy,\" \"co-inhibitory blockade,\" \"autoimmune events,\" \"side effects,\" \"immunotherapy side effects,\" \"cancer treatment safety,\" \"checkpoints,\" \"PD-1/PD-L1 blockade,\" \"CTLA-4 blockade,\" \"oncology treatments,\" and \"immuno-oncology.\" These terms maintain the original search intent while providing valuable alternative pathways for retrieval.\n\nThe augmented query, incorporating these expansion terms, would be: \"Cancer treatment, immunotherapy, co-inhibitory blockade, autoimmune events, side effects, cancer immunotherapy safety, checkpoints, PD-1/PD-L1 blockade, CTLA-4 blockade.\"\n\nThis thought process demonstrates how the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal technique, combined with natural cognitive patterns, can lead to a comprehensive and effective query expansion that enhances document retrieval.",
