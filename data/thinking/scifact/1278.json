  "thought_process": "The user is searching a BM25 index for \"The treatment of cancer patients with co-IR blockade does not cause any adverse autoimmune events.\" I need to uncover optimal search terms to use with that algorithm by determining the intent of their search. The user seems to be looking for information on the safety of cancer treatment using co-inhibitory blockade, specifically regarding the absence of adverse autoimmune events.\n\nTo expand this query, I will be playing the mind game of \"Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal.\" This technique involves analyzing the query, constructing a conceptual graph, selecting expansion paths, and extracting high-value terms. \n\nFirst, I analyze the query to identify core concepts: cancer treatment, co-IR blockade, and autoimmune events. The search intent is informational, seeking to understand the safety profile of a specific medical intervention. \n\nNext, I construct a conceptual graph with core nodes (cancer treatment, co-IR blockade, autoimmune events), first-order connections (immunotherapy, side effects), and second-order connections (checkpoints, immunotherapy safety). The domain context is oncology and immunology.\n\nThen, I select promising expansion paths: \n- Synonymous terms (e.g., \"cancer therapy\" instead of \"cancer treatment\"),\n- Hierarchical terms (e.g., \"immunotherapy\" as a broader concept),\n- Compositional terms (e.g., \"co-inhibitory receptors\" as components),\n- Contextual terms (e.g., \"clinical trials\" as settings),\n- Domain-specific terminology (e.g., \"PD-1/PD-L1 blockade\" as field-specific variants).\n\nFor each expansion path, I extract high-value terms: \n- Synonyms: cancer therapy, oncology treatment\n- Hierarchical: immunotherapy, checkpoint inhibition\n- Compositional: co-inhibitory receptors, immune checkpoints\n- Contextual: clinical trials, cancer research\n- Domain-specific: PD-1/PD-L1 blockade, CTLA-4 blockade\n\nAfter filtering these terms based on relevance, distinctiveness, specificity, and searchability, I obtain a set of expanded terms that maintain the original search intent while providing valuable alternative pathways for retrieval.\n\nTherefore, the optimal BM25 search terms are cancer treatment, immunotherapy, side effects, co-inhibitory blockade, autoimmune events, checkpoints, PD-1, PD-L1, CTLA-4, oncology.",
