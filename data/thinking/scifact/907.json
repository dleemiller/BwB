  "thought_process": "The user is searching a BM25 index for 'PGE 2 promotes intestinal tumor growth by altering the expression of tumor suppressing and DNA repair genes'. I need to uncover optimal search terms to use with that algorithm by determining the intent of their search. The user seems to be looking for a deeper understanding of how PGE2 influences intestinal tumor growth, specifically through its effects on gene regulation and expression.\n\nTo achieve this, I will be playing the mind game of \"query expansion\" which involves applying various techniques to broaden and deepen the search query. This technique includes steps such as identifying ineffective terms, performing breadth expansion through concepts like DNA methylation and epigenetic regulation, and then conducting depth expansion by diving deeper into specific areas like histone modification and transcription factor activity.\n\nFirst, I identify the primary objectives and gaps in the original query. The user wants to understand how PGE2 affects specific tumor-suppressing and DNA repair genes, and the molecular mechanisms behind this effect. The gaps in the query include the lack of specificity regarding which genes are targeted and how PGE2 alters their expression.\n\nNext, I recognize that terms like \"intestinal\" and \"tumor growth\" are too broad and might not yield the most relevant results, as they are ineffective in pinpointing the exact mechanisms of interest.\n\nFor breadth expansion, I consider terms that introduce new dimensions to the query, such as \"DNA methylation\", \"epigenetic regulation\", \"microRNA\", \"signal transduction pathways\", and \"inflammatory response\". These terms expand the query by incorporating concepts related to gene expression and regulation that could be influenced by PGE2.\n\nThen, for depth expansion, I select one of these broader concepts, \"epigenetic regulation\", and delve deeper into related terms. This includes exploring \"histone modification\", \"chromatin remodeling\", \"transcription factor activity\", and \"gene silencing\". These terms provide a more detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms through which PGE2 could alter gene expression in intestinal tumors.\n\nBy applying these expansion techniques, I can see how the query evolves to include more specific and relevant terms that capture the complexities of PGE2's influence on gene regulation in intestinal tumors.\n\nTherefore, the optimal BM25 search terms are PGE2 DNA methylation histone modification transcription factor microRNA.",
