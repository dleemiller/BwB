  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"PGE 2 promotes intestinal tumor growth by altering the expression of tumor suppressing and DNA repair genes,\" my first thought is that this query is quite specific but still has room for exploration in terms of the exact mechanisms and genes involved. The user seems to be interested in understanding how PGE2 influences tumor growth, particularly focusing on its impact on tumor-suppressing and DNA repair genes. This makes me think of various molecular pathways that could be involved, such as epigenetic modifications, signal transduction pathways, and possibly even inflammatory responses, given the role of PGE2 in inflammation.\n\nTo approach this systematically, I'll use a structured technique that involves understanding the primary objectives of the query, identifying gaps in the current query, recognizing ineffective or overly broad terms, and then applying both breadth and depth expansion techniques. The breadth expansion will help in identifying new, relevant concepts and terms that are not directly mentioned in the original query but are closely related, such as DNA methylation, epigenetic regulation, and microRNA. The depth expansion will allow me to dive deeper into one of these areas, for instance, epigenetic regulation, and explore related terms like histone modification, chromatin remodeling, and transcription factor activity.\n\nAs I start this process, I notice that terms like \"intestinal\" and \"tumor growth\" are quite broad and might not yield the most specific results. I'll keep these in mind as terms to potentially avoid or refine in the expanded query. My goal is to find terms that are both specific and diverse, offering new dimensions to the query without overlapping with the original terms.\n\nApplying the breadth expansion technique, I consider concepts that are increasingly distant but still relevant to the original query. Terms like DNA methylation, epigenetic regulation, microRNA, signal transduction pathways, and inflammatory response come to mind. These terms start to paint a picture of the complex interactions that PGE2 might have with gene expression in intestinal tumors.\n\nFor the depth expansion, I choose to focus on epigenetic regulation, as it seems particularly relevant given the query's interest in gene expression alterations. Delving deeper, I consider terms like histone modification, chromatin remodeling, transcription factor activity, and gene silencing. Each of these terms offers a more nuanced understanding of how PGE2 could be influencing tumor-suppressing and DNA repair genes.\n\nAs I synthesize this information, I realize that the key to a successful expanded query lies in balancing specificity with diversity and ensuring that the terms are both relevant and targeted. I aim to create an augmented query that captures the essence of the original query while introducing new dimensions that can lead to the discovery of novel, relevant documents.\n\nThrough this process of applying structured techniques and exploring related threads, I believe the terms that would be most effective for the augmented query are those that reflect the molecular mechanisms underlying PGE2's influence on gene expression, particularly focusing on epigenetic regulation and its associated processes.",
