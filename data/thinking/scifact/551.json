  "reasoning": "The query is focused on the specific molecular mechanism of ITAM phosphorylation and its effect on T cell receptor (TCR) signal transfer from the ectodomain to the cytoplasmic tail. Given the strengths and weaknesses of the current results, there's a need to enhance the query to directly address the role of ITAM phosphorylation in this context while maintaining relevance to TCR signaling mechanisms. This involves identifying core concepts and entities related to ITAM phosphorylation, TCR signaling, and the structural components of the TCR, such as the ectodomain and cytoplasmic tail.",

  "thought_process": "The user is searching a BM25 index for \"ITAM phosphorylation prevents the transfer of the T cell receptor (TCR) signal from the ectodomain to the cytoplasmic tail of the T cell receptor (TCR)\". I need to uncover optimal search terms to use with that algorithm by determining the intent of their search. The user seems to be looking for information on how ITAM phosphorylation affects the signaling process of the T cell receptor, specifically focusing on the prevention of signal transfer from the ectodomain to the cytoplasmic tail.\n\nTo achieve this, I will be playing the mind game of \"Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal\". This technique involves analyzing the query, constructing a conceptual graph, selecting expansion paths, and extracting high-value terms to enhance the query. \n\nFirst, I identify the core concepts and entities in the original query: ITAM phosphorylation, T cell receptor (TCR), ectodomain, cytoplasmic tail, and signal transfer. The search intent appears to be informational, aiming to understand the molecular mechanism behind ITAM phosphorylation's effect on TCR signaling. \n\nNext, I construct a conceptual graph with these core nodes and their connections. The graph includes first-order connections like the relationship between ITAM phosphorylation and TCR signaling, and second-order connections such as the involvement of tyrosine kinases and co-receptors in this process. \n\nFor expansion path selection, I identify promising directions: synonymous terms (e.g., \"ITAM phosphorylation\" and \"tyrosine phosphorylation\"), hierarchical terms (e.g., \"TCR signaling\" and \"immune cell signaling\"), compositional terms (e.g., \"ectodomain\" and \"cytoplasmic tail\" as components of the TCR), contextual terms (e.g., \"immunological synapse\" as a setting for TCR signaling), and domain-specific terminology (e.g., \"ZAP-70\" as a specific tyrosine kinase involved in TCR signaling).\n\nI then extract high-value terms from these paths, focusing on relevance, distinctiveness, specificity, and searchability. Terms like \"tyrosine kinase\", \"Src family kinases\", \"ZAP-70\", \"co-receptors\", \"immunological synapse\", and \"plasma membrane\" are identified as valuable for enhancing the query.\n\nTherefore, the optimal BM25 search terms are ITAM, phosphorylation, TCR, ectodomain, cytoplasmic tail, tyrosine kinase, Src family kinases, ZAP-70, co-receptors, immunological synapse, plasma membrane, signal transduction, immune cell signaling.",
