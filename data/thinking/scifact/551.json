  "reasoning": "The query is focused on the specific molecular mechanism of ITAM phosphorylation and its effect on T cell receptor (TCR) signal transfer from the ectodomain to the cytoplasmic tail. Given the strengths and weaknesses of the current results, there's a need to enhance the query to directly address the role of ITAM phosphorylation in this context while maintaining relevance to TCR signaling mechanisms. This involves identifying core concepts and entities related to ITAM phosphorylation, TCR signaling, and the structural components of the TCR, such as the ectodomain and cytoplasmic tail.",

  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query about ITAM phosphorylation preventing the transfer of the T cell receptor (TCR) signal from the ectodomain to the cytoplasmic tail, this makes me think of the intricate mechanisms involved in TCR signaling and how modifications such as phosphorylation can significantly impact signal transduction. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the molecular basis of immune cell activation and how alterations in ITAM phosphorylation could affect this process, the query is quite specific and needs expansion to capture a broader yet still relevant set of information.\n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here, but to ensure a systematic approach, let me apply the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal technique, which involves constructing a conceptual graph of the query and its related concepts, then traversing this graph to identify high-value expansion terms. This should help because it allows for a structured exploration of the query's context, intent, and relevant terminology.\n\nFirst, analyzing the query, the core concepts are ITAM phosphorylation, TCR signaling, and the structural components of the TCR like the ectodomain and cytoplasmic tail. The search intent seems informational, aiming to understand the role of ITAM phosphorylation in TCR signal transduction. Implicit assumptions include the importance of tyrosine kinases and co-receptors in this process.\n\nNext, constructing the conceptual graph, we have core nodes like ITAM, TCR, ectodomain, cytoplasmic tail, and phosphorylation. First-order connections include the relationships between ITAM and TCR signaling, the role of tyrosine kinases in phosphorylation, and how co-receptors like CD4 and CD8 interact with the TCR complex. Second-order connections might involve the immunological synapse, the plasma membrane, and specific types of T cells. Domain contexts include immunology, cell biology, and molecular biology.\n\nFor expansion path selection, promising directions include synonymous terms (e.g., \"tyrosine phosphorylation\" for \"ITAM phosphorylation\"), hierarchical terms (e.g., \"immune receptor signaling\" for \"TCR signaling\"), compositional terms (e.g., \"TCR subunits\" like CD3), contextual terms (e.g., \"antigen presentation\"), and domain-specific terminology (e.g., \"immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif\" for ITAM).\n\nExtracting and filtering terms, we look for relevance, distinctiveness, specificity, and searchability. Terms like \"tyrosine kinase activity,\" \"TCR complex assembly,\" \"immunological synapse formation,\" \"co-receptor binding,\" and \"signal transduction pathways\" seem promising. They are relevant to the query, distinct from the original terms, specific in their meaning, and likely to appear in relevant documents.\n\nThrough this process of applying the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal technique and exploring related threads, I believe the following terms would be most effective for expanding the query: ITAM, TCR, ectodomain, cytoplasmic tail, phosphorylation, tyrosine kinase, co-receptors, immunological synapse, TCR complex, and signal transduction. These capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, including the molecular mechanisms and the broader context of T cell activation and immune response.\n\nThus, the expanded query could be: \"Role of ITAM phosphorylation in preventing signal transfer from the ectodomain to the cytoplasmic tail of the T cell receptor (TCR) and its impact on TCR subunit association with the plasma membrane, including the involvement of tyrosine kinases and co-receptors in TCR signaling and activation, within the context of immunological synapse formation and signal transduction pathways.\"",
