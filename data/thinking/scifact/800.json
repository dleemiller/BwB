  "thought_process": "The user is searching a BM25 index for \"Modifying the epigenome in the brain affects the normal human aging process by affecting certain genes related to neurogenesis.\" I need to uncover optimal search terms to use with that algorithm by determining the intent of their search. The user seems to be looking for information on how changes to the epigenome, specifically in the brain, impact the aging process, focusing on genes involved in neurogenesis.\n\nTo expand this query, I'm playing a mind game called \"Query Expansion via Temporal Evolution Analysis.\" This game involves analyzing how the query topic has evolved over time and will likely develop in the future to discover temporally diverse terminology. \n\nFirst, I look into the historical foundation of epigenetics, tracing its origins and early development. I identify foundational concepts like \"epigenesis\" by Conrad Waddington, the discovery of DNA methylation, and the identification of histone modifications. These historical approaches and methodologies provide a baseline understanding of the topic.\n\nNext, I map key evolutionary stages in the development of epigenetics, noting breakthrough moments like the coining of the term \"epigenetics\" in 1942, the identification of DNA methylation in the 1950s-1960s, and the understanding of histone modifications in the 1980s. I see how language and concepts have transformed over time, with terms like \"epigenetic reprogramming\" and \"epigenomics\" emerging in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.\n\nThen, I assess the contemporary state of epigenetics, identifying current best practices and leading approaches. Today, there's a focus on epigenetics in brain development and function, the study of DNA methylation and histone modifications in neurogenesis and aging, and the exploration of pharmacological interventions targeting epigenetic enzymes.\n\nLooking to the future, I project how epigenetics is likely to evolve, identifying emerging trends like precision medicine approaches using epigenetic profiles, the development of targeted epigenetic therapies for neurodegenerative diseases, and the investigation of the gut microbiome's influence on brain epigenetics.\n\nFinally, I compile terminology from each time period, identifying terms that have remained relevant across eras, like \"DNA methylation\" and \"histone modifications,\" and select terms that provide historical context or future relevance, such as \"epigenetic modification,\" \"neurogenesis,\" \"aging interventions,\" \"histone acetylation,\" \"brain plasticity,\" and \"age-related neurodegenerative diseases.\"\n\nTherefore, the optimal BM25 search terms are epigenetic modification, neurogenesis, aging interventions, DNA methylation, histone acetylation, brain plasticity, age-related neurodegenerative diseases.",
