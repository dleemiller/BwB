  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"Ultrasound guidance significantly raises the number of traumatic procedures when attempting needle insertion,\" this makes me think of the potential risks and complications associated with ultrasound guidance in medical procedures. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the reasons behind this increase, I'm not sure yet. My initial impression is that the query is focused on the negative impact of ultrasound guidance, but I need to consider the context and potential benefits as well.\n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here, but to approach this systematically, I'll use the technique of query expansion, which involves identifying ineffective terms, breadth expansion, and depth expansion. This should help because it allows me to explore related concepts and terms that might not be immediately apparent.\n\nStarting with the ineffective terms, I notice that \"ultrasonic\" and \"guidance\" are quite broad and might not be effective in narrowing down the search results. I'll make a mental note to avoid these terms in the expanded query.\n\nMoving on to breadth expansion, I'm considering terms like \"minimally invasive surgery,\" \"percutaneous procedures,\" \"biopsy,\" \"interventional radiology,\" \"surgical navigation,\" and \"image-guided therapy.\" These terms seem to be related to the original query, but I need to ensure that they're not too generic.\n\nAs I delve deeper into the topic, I'm drawn to \"minimally invasive surgery\" as a potential area for depth expansion. This leads me to consider terms like \"laparoscopic surgery,\" \"robotic surgery,\" \"tissue retraction,\" and \"surgical stapling.\" I'm noticing that these terms are becoming increasingly specific, which is good, but I also want to ensure that they're still relevant to the original query.\n\nApplying the query expansion technique, I'm realizing that the augmented query should include terms that are both specific and diverse. I'll aim to create a query that introduces new dimensions to the search while avoiding overlapping terms.\n\nFollowing the technique's steps, I'm identifying high-quality search terms that meet the criteria. I'm considering terms from the depth expansion, such as \"laparoscopic,\" \"robotic,\" \"tissue retraction,\" and \"surgical stapling.\" I'm also looking for additional high-relevance terms that can enhance the query without duplicating existing terms.\n\nThrough this process of applying the query expansion technique and exploring related threads, I believe that the augmented query should include terms like \"minimally invasive,\" \"laparoscopic,\" \"robotic,\" \"tissue retraction,\" and \"surgical stapling.\" These terms capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, and they're targeted, diverse, and relevant to the original query.",
