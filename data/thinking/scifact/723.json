While existing results provide a good foundation, they lack specific examples and deeper insights into the signaling pathways involved. To improve the search, we need to: 1) clarify the goals of the research, 2) identify terms that might be too broad, 3) explore related concepts beyond membrane rafts, 4) delve deeper into one specific aspect of membrane raft regulation, and finally, 5) construct an augmented query incorporating these refinements.",

  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"Ly49Q directs the organization of neutrophil migration to inflammation sites by regulating membrane raft functions,\" this makes me think of the complex processes involved in cell migration and how specific proteins like Ly49Q play a crucial role. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the molecular mechanisms behind this migration, it seems the query is more focused on the regulatory aspect of Ly49Q on membrane rafts. Hmm, not sure yet how to approach this, but it seems like we need to delve into both the specific functions of Ly49Q and the broader context of cell signaling and membrane dynamics.\n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here, but let me approach this using a structured technique for query expansion, which involves identifying the primary objectives, pinpointing ineffective terms, and then expanding both in breadth and depth. This should help because it allows us to systematically analyze the query, avoid overly broad terms, and introduce new, relevant concepts that can enhance our search results.\n\nFirst, let's clarify the goals of the research. We want to understand Ly49Q's influence on neutrophil migration, identify specific mechanisms of membrane raft regulation by Ly49Q, and explore signaling pathways involved in Ly49Q-mediated migration. These goals suggest we need to focus on targeted expansions that introduce new dimensions to the query without overlapping with the original terms.\n\nFollowing the expansion technique, we identify \"organization\" and \"inflammation\" as potentially ineffective terms because they are broad and may not yield specific enough results related to Ly49Q's function. For breadth expansion, we consider terms like \"lipid rafts,\" \"cell adhesion molecules,\" \"cytoskeleton,\" \"chemotaxis,\" and \"signal transduction.\" These terms expand our query to related concepts beyond just membrane rafts, potentially uncovering new insights into how Ly49Q operates in neutrophil migration.\n\nFor depth expansion, we choose \"lipid rafts\" as a key concept and delve deeper into related terms such as \"cholesterol,\" \"sphingolipids,\" \"lipid-protein interactions,\" and \"signaling cascades.\" This depth expansion is crucial because it allows us to understand the intricate mechanisms by which Ly49Q might regulate membrane raft functions, potentially leading to a more nuanced understanding of neutrophil migration.\n\nThis process of applying the expansion technique and exploring related threads brings to light specific terms that could enhance our search. For instance, applying the depth expansion leads us to terms like \"cholesterol\" and \"sphingolipids,\" which are crucial components of lipid rafts and could play a significant role in Ly49Q's regulatory function. I just had a realization that connects to what we were exploring earlier - the importance of lipid-protein interactions in signaling cascades. This connection highlights how Ly49Q, through its regulation of membrane raft composition and function, could influence signaling pathways involved in neutrophil migration.\n\nThrough this process of applying the expansion technique and exploring related threads, I believe the following terms would be most effective for an augmented query: Ly49Q, neutrophil migration, membrane rafts, cholesterol, sphingolipids, signal transduction, chemotaxis. These terms capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, providing a balanced approach between the structured technique and natural cognitive patterns.",
