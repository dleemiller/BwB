  "thought_process": "The user is searching a BM25 index for \"Leukemia associated Rho guanine nucleotide-exchange factor represses RhoA in response to SRC activation.\" I need to uncover optimal search terms to use with that algorithm by determining the intent of their search. The user seems to be looking for specific information on how a particular Rho guanine nucleotide-exchange factor (GEF) interacts with RhoA in the context of leukemia, especially in response to SRC activation.\n\nTo expand this query, I will play the mind game of \"conceptual expansion,\" which involves identifying key concepts in the original query and then expanding on those concepts to include related but broader or more specific terms. This technique allows us to explore different dimensions of the query, potentially uncovering new and relevant information that wasn't immediately apparent.\n\nFirst, let's identify the key concepts: leukemia, Rho guanine nucleotide-exchange factor, RhoA, and SRC activation. The existing reasoning highlights the need to understand this GEF's role in leukemia, particularly how SRC activation influences its behavior. The task outcomes provide clear goals: identifying leukemia-specific Rho GEFs, investigating the mechanisms of SRC activation on this GEF, and exploring its connection to leukemia progression.\n\nThe ineffective terms listed, such as \"Rho GTPases,\" \"force sensing,\" \"cytoskeletal dynamics,\" suggest we should avoid overly broad or non-specific terms that might not directly contribute to understanding the specific interaction in question.\n\nFor breadth expansion, we consider terms like \"leukemia associated proteins,\" \"cancer signaling pathways,\" \"oncogenes,\" \"tumor suppressor genes,\" \"cell proliferation,\" and \"apoptosis.\" These terms expand our search to include a wider range of concepts related to leukemia and cancer biology, potentially introducing new dimensions to our query.\n\nIn depth expansion, focusing on \"SRC family kinases,\" we delve deeper into the signaling pathways involved, including \"phosphorylation,\" \"downstream targets,\" \"RAS-MAPK pathway,\" and \"NF-\u03baB signaling.\" This step allows us to understand the intricate mechanisms by which SRC activation could influence our GEF of interest, providing a richer context for our search.\n\nBy playing this mind game of conceptual expansion, we've moved from a very specific interaction to a broader understanding of the biological context in which this interaction occurs. We've identified key terms that can enhance our search, ensuring we capture the complexity of the relationship between this leukemia-associated Rho GEF, SRC activation, and the signaling pathways involved.\n\nTherefore, the optimal BM25 search terms are leukemia associated Rho GEF SRC phosphorylation RAS-MAPK NF-\u03baB.",
