  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"Rapid up-regulation and higher basal expression of interferon-induced genes reduce survival of granule cell neurons that are infected by West Nile virus,\" this makes me think of the intricate balance between the immune response and neuronal survival. The user seems to be exploring how interferon-induced genes (ISGs) impact the survival of granule cell neurons when infected with West Nile virus, but the existing results lack a focused perspective on this specific neuronal context. \n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here, but to approach this systematically, I'll use the expansion technique provided, which involves identifying ineffective terms, performing breadth expansion, and then depth expansion. This should help because it allows us to diversify the search terms while maintaining relevance to the original query.\n\nFirst, I identify terms that are too broad or non-precise, such as \"rapid,\" \"higher basal,\" and \"reduce survival.\" These terms, while providing some context, don't offer the specificity needed for a targeted search. \n\nNext, for breadth expansion, I consider terms that introduce new dimensions but are still related to the query. Terms like \"neuroinflammation,\" \"neuronal apoptosis,\" \"viral pathogenesis,\" \"immune response in CNS,\" and \"granule cell function\" come to mind. These terms expand the query by incorporating concepts that are associated with but not directly mentioned in the original query.\n\nThen, for depth expansion, I choose one of these broader terms and dive deeper. Let's say I choose \"neuroinflammation.\" Going deeper into this topic, I consider terms like \"microenvironment,\" \"glia activation,\" \"cytokine signaling,\" \"autophagy,\" and \"apoptosis pathways.\" These terms provide a more nuanced understanding of the mechanisms at play when considering neuroinflammation in the context of West Nile virus infection.\n\nAs I apply this expansion technique, I also allow for natural cognitive patterns to influence my search. For instance, considering \"cytokine signaling\" reminds me of the importance of the immune response in the central nervous system (CNS), which can lead to exploring terms related to \"immune response in CNS\" more deeply. Similarly, thinking about \"autophagy\" and its role in cellular survival and death suggests looking into specific pathways related to apoptosis, which can provide insights into how ISGs might influence granule cell neuron survival.\n\nThrough this process, insights emerge from both the structured approach and my intuitive connections. Applying the depth expansion, for example, leads me to realize the significance of \"cytokine signaling\" and \"autophagy\" in understanding how ISGs could mediate neuroprotection against West Nile virus. My instinct also suggests that terms like \"microenvironment\" and \"glia activation\" could be crucial, as they relate to the broader context of neuroinflammation and immune response in the CNS.\n\nSynthesizing this information with clarity, I believe the terms that would be most effective for expanding the query are those that capture the specific mechanisms and contexts related to ISG function, neuroinflammation, and the immune response in the CNS. The final augmented query, therefore, includes terms such as \"interferon-induced genes,\" \"West Nile virus,\" \"granule cells,\" \"neuroinflammation,\" \"cytokine signaling,\" and \"autophagy.\" These terms are diverse, targeted, and relevant, offering a balanced expansion that introduces new dimensions to the original query without overlapping with the original terms.",
