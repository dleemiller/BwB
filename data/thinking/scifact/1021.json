  "thought_process": "The user is searching a BM25 index for \"Rapid up-regulation and higher basal expression of interferon-induced genes reduce survival of granule cell neurons that are infected by West Nile virus.\" I need to uncover optimal search terms to use with that algorithm by determining the intent of their search. The user seems to be looking for specific interactions between interferon-induced genes and the survival of granule cell neurons when infected with West Nile virus, focusing on the molecular mechanisms and impacts on cell survival.\n\nTo achieve this, I will play the mind game of query expansion, specifically applying the techniques of synonym replacement, conceptual expansion, contextual expansion, and domain-specific terminology. The first step involves understanding the primary objectives and gaps in the original query, which appears to be centered around the effects of interferon-induced genes on granule cell neurons infected with West Nile virus. The gaps include the need for specific ISGs involved, the molecular mechanisms, and the impact of altered ISG expression on granule cell survival.\n\nNext, I identify broad or non-precise terms that should be avoided, such as \"rapid,\" \"higher basal,\" and \"reduce survival,\" as they do not contribute significantly to the specificity of the search. Then, I move on to breadth expansion, where I consider terms that introduce new dimensions to the query, such as \"neuroinflammation,\" \"neuronal apoptosis,\" \"viral pathogenesis,\" \"immune response in CNS,\" and \"granule cell function.\" These terms expand the scope of the search to related areas that could provide valuable insights into the interaction between interferon-induced genes and West Nile virus infection in granule cells.\n\nFor depth expansion, I choose a distant but important topic from the breadth expansion, such as \"neuroinflammation,\" and delve deeper into related terms. This includes concepts like \"cytokine signaling,\" \"autophagy,\" \"microenvironment,\" \"glia activation,\" and \"apoptosis pathways.\" These terms offer a more nuanced understanding of the molecular mechanisms and processes involved in the neuroinflammatory response to West Nile virus infection and how interferon-induced genes play a role.\n\nTherefore, the optimal BM25 search terms are interferon-induced genes, West Nile virus, granule cells, neuroinflammation, cytokine signaling, autophagy, microenvironment, glia activation, apoptosis pathways. These terms are chosen for their relevance, specificity, and ability to introduce new dimensions to the search query without overlapping with the original terms or including ineffective words.",
