  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"Febrile seizures increase the threshold for development of epilepsy,\" my initial impression is that this query is trying to understand the relationship between febrile seizures and the risk of developing epilepsy. The user seems to be seeking information on how febrile seizures might influence the development of epilepsy, possibly looking for underlying mechanisms or potential preventative measures. However, the terms \"increase,\" \"the threshold,\" and \"development\" seem too broad and might not yield specific studies directly examining this causal relationship.\n\nTo approach this query expansion, I'll use a technique that involves analyzing the query's objectives, identifying ineffective terms, and then applying breadth and depth expansions. This technique, which we can call \"Query Augmentation through Objective Analysis\" (QAOA), helps in discovering new, relevant documents by introducing new dimensions to the query.\n\nFirst, let's elucidate the goals and gaps in the original query. The primary objective is to understand the connection between febrile seizures and epilepsy risk, including identifying underlying biological mechanisms and exploring potential preventative measures. A gap in the query is its lack of specificity regarding the mechanisms and pathways involved in this relationship.\n\nNext, we identify ineffective terms that should be avoided due to their broadness or lack of precision. Terms like \"increase,\" \"the threshold,\" and \"development\" are too general and might not lead to targeted research on the topic.\n\nFor breadth expansion, we look for candidate terms that introduce new but related concepts. Terms such as \"neuroinflammation,\" \"brain development,\" \"genetic predisposition,\" \"epileptogenesis,\" and \"seizure threshold\" offer a broader perspective on the topic, moving beyond the direct causal link to consider factors that might influence the development of epilepsy following febrile seizures.\n\nNow, for depth expansion, we choose one of these broader topics and delve deeper into related terms. Let's focus on \"neuroinflammation.\" By exploring terms related to neuroinflammation, we can better understand one of the potential underlying mechanisms. Terms like \"glial cells,\" \"cytokine release,\" \"neuronal hyperexcitability,\" and \"synaptic plasticity\" provide a deeper insight into how neuroinflammation might contribute to the development of epilepsy after febrile seizures.\n\nApplying the QAOA technique and considering the insights from both breadth and depth expansions, I realize that the terms \"febrile seizures,\" \"neuroinflammation,\" \"glial cells,\" \"cytokine release,\" \"neuronal hyperexcitability,\" and \"synaptic plasticity\" capture the essence of what we're looking for. These terms are specific, diverse, and targeted towards understanding the relationship between febrile seizures and epilepsy development, including potential biological mechanisms and preventative measures.\n\nThrough this process of applying the QAOA technique and exploring related threads, I believe the terms \"febrile seizures, neuroinflammation, glial cells, cytokine release, neuronal hyperexcitability, synaptic plasticity\" would be most effective for a targeted search. They not only capture the explicit aspects of the user's query but also incorporate implicit aspects related to the underlying mechanisms and potential preventative measures.",
