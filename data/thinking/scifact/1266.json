  "thought_process": "The user is searching a BM25 index for \"The risk of breast cancer among parous women increases with placental weight of pregnancies, and this association is strongest for premenopausal breast cancer.\" I need to uncover optimal search terms to use with that algorithm by determining the intent of their search. The user seems to be looking for an understanding of how placental weight during pregnancy affects the risk of breast cancer, particularly in women who have given birth and are premenopausal.\n\nTo expand this query, I will apply the technique of combining breadth and depth expansion. First, I'll briefly explain the mind game: it involves identifying ineffective terms, expanding the query to include broader concepts (breadth expansion), and then delving deeper into one of these concepts to uncover more specific terms (depth expansion). \n\nStarting with the original query, I notice terms like \"The risk,\" \"of,\" and \"among\" are not very specific and could be considered ineffective for a precise search. The main concepts here are breast cancer, parous women, placental weight, and premenopausal status.\n\nFor breadth expansion, I consider related concepts such as hormonal regulation, fetal development, epigenetic modifications, immune system function, and environmental exposures. These terms introduce new dimensions to the query, focusing on potential biological mechanisms and external factors that could influence the relationship between placental weight and breast cancer risk.\n\nNext, for depth expansion, I choose one of these broader concepts, epigenetic modifications, and delve deeper into it. Epigenetic modifications could include DNA methylation, histone modification, changes in gene expression patterns, and potentially the activation of oncogenes. These terms are more specific and targeted, offering a deeper understanding of the biological mechanisms at play.\n\nTherefore, the optimal BM25 search terms are hormonal regulation, fetal development, epigenetic modifications, DNA methylation, histone modification, gene expression patterns, oncogene activation, premenopausal breast cancer.",
