  "thought_process": "The user is searching a BM25 index for \"Vitamin D deficiency is unrelated to birth weight\". I need to uncover optimal search terms to use with that algorithm by determining the intent of their search. The user seems to be looking for information on the relationship between vitamin D deficiency and birth weight, which suggests they are interested in understanding whether there is a correlation or causation between these two factors.\n\nTo expand this query, I will play the mind game of \"Query Expansion via User Intent and Journey Mapping\". This technique involves analyzing how different users would seek this information throughout their journey from awareness to expertise. I will create user personas, analyze search vocabulary, map information journeys, identify contextual scenarios, and extract intent-based terms.\n\nFirst, I create four distinct user personas: a novice parent, a pregnant woman, a nutritionist, and a medical researcher. Each persona has varying levels of expertise, goals, and motivations for seeking this information. For example, the novice parent might search for \"Does vitamin D affect baby's birth weight?\" while the medical researcher might search for \"Meta-analysis of vitamin D supplementation and birth weight outcomes\".\n\nNext, I analyze the search vocabulary for each persona, identifying initial search terms, follow-up searches, and how their vocabulary differs based on expertise. I notice that the novice parent and pregnant woman tend to use more general terms like \"vitamin D and birth weight\" or \"prenatal vitamin D for healthy birth weight\", while the nutritionist and medical researcher use more specific terms like \"biochemical pathways of vitamin D influencing fetal growth\" or \"impact of maternal vitamin D levels on newborn weight\".\n\nI then map the progressive information needs as users learn more about the topic. For the novice parent, the entry-point question might be \"What is vitamin D?\" and the intermediate learning milestone might be understanding the importance of vitamin D during pregnancy. For the medical researcher, the advanced concept exploration vocabulary might include terms like \"vitamin D receptor polymorphisms\" or \"fetal growth restriction\".\n\nI also identify specific scenarios where users need this information, such as planning a pregnancy, during pregnancy health consultations, or addressing nutritional concerns. In each scenario, I consider the problem-solving situations, learning contexts, decision-making moments, and practical application settings that might prompt a search.\n\nFinally, I extract high-value terms across the expertise spectrum, contextual vocabulary from different usage scenarios, and intent-revealing terminology that clarifies the search purpose. From all personas and scenarios, I extract terms like \"vitamin D deficiency\", \"birth weight\", \"pregnancy\", \"infant health\", \"fetal growth\", \"prenatal care\", \"nutritional intervention\", \"clinical trials\", \"meta-analysis\", and \"mechanism of action\".\n\nTherefore, the optimal BM25 search terms are: vitamin D deficiency, birth weight, pregnancy, infant health, fetal growth, prenatal care, nutritional intervention, clinical trials, meta-analysis, mechanism of action, obstetrics, pediatrics, vitamin D supplementation, maternal vitamin D levels, newborn weight, biochemical pathways.",
