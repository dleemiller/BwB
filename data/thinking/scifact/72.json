  "thought_process": "The user is searching a BM25 index for \"Activator-inhibitor pairs are provided dorsally by Admpchordin.\" I need to uncover optimal search terms to use with that algorithm by determining the intent of their search. The user seems to be looking for specific mechanisms involving activator-inhibitor pairs, particularly those related to ADMP and Chordin, and their role in dorsal patterning during morphogenesis.\n\nTo expand this query, I will play the mind game of applying the expansion technique provided. This technique involves several steps, including goal elucidation, ineffective term identification, breadth expansion, and depth expansion. I will briefly explain each step and then walk through how I apply them to the query.\n\nFirst, I identify the primary objectives and gaps in the original query. The user wants to understand the specific activator-inhibitor pairs involved in dorsal morphogenesis and the role of ADMP and Chordin beyond BMP inhibition. The gaps include the lack of detail on dorsal patterning and the interplay with other signaling molecules.\n\nNext, I identify ineffective terms that are too broad or non-precise. These terms include \"provided,\" \"dorsally,\" and \"generally.\" I will avoid these terms in the expansion to ensure the new query is more targeted.\n\nFor breadth expansion, I consider terms that are increasingly distant from the original query but still relevant. These terms include \"segmentation,\" \"neural tube,\" \"mesoderm,\" \"cell fate,\" \"axial patterning,\" and \"gradient formation.\" These terms introduce new dimensions to the query, exploring related concepts in developmental biology.\n\nThen, for depth expansion, I choose one of these distant but important topics, \"segmentation,\" and delve deeper into related terms. This includes exploring \"Hox genes,\" \"parasegmental organization,\" \"pair-rule genes,\" and \"transcriptional regulation.\" This step allows me to uncover more specific and relevant terms that can enhance the query.\n\nBy applying this expansion technique, I have moved from the original query to a more detailed and specific set of search terms. The process involved understanding the user's intent, avoiding ineffective terms, expanding the query to related concepts, and then drilling down into more specific terms within one of those concepts.\n\nTherefore, the optimal BM25 search terms are ADMP Chordin BMP segmentation Hox genes transcription regulatory. These terms are specific, diverse, and targeted, avoiding logical operators and ineffective words, and are designed to yield non-overlapping results from the original query that are contextually relevant.",
