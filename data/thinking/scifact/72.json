  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"Activator-inhibitor pairs are provided dorsally by Admpchordin,\" this makes me think of the intricate mechanisms involved in morphogenesis, particularly how specific molecules like ADMP and Chordin play crucial roles in dorsal patterning. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the deeper implications of these pairs in developmental biology, the initial query seems too narrow, focusing only on the dorsal provision of these molecules. Hmm, not sure yet how to expand this without losing the core intent.\n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here, but to systematically approach this, let me use the expansion technique that involves identifying gaps in the current query, recognizing ineffective terms, and then applying breadth and depth expansions. This should help because it allows us to methodically uncover new dimensions of the query while ensuring we don't stray too far from the original intent.\n\nFirst, examining the primary objectives, the query aims to understand the specific activator-inhibitor pairs involved in dorsal morphogenesis, particularly focusing on ADMP and Chordin's roles. A gap here is the lack of detail on how these molecules interact with other signaling pathways and developmental processes. Ineffective terms like \"provided,\" \"dorsally,\" and \"generally\" should be avoided as they don't add much specificity to the query.\n\nFor breadth expansion, terms like \"segmentation,\" \"neural tube,\" \"mesoderm,\" \"cell fate,\" \"axial patterning,\" and \"gradient formation\" could introduce new dimensions, exploring how activator-inhibitor pairs influence various aspects of development. Among these, \"segmentation\" stands out as a crucial process in development that could be deeply influenced by such molecular interactions.\n\nDelving deeper into \"segmentation\" for depth expansion, we consider terms like \"Hox genes,\" \"parasegmental organization,\" \"pair-rule genes,\" and \"transcriptional regulation.\" These terms progressively narrow down the focus to specific genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying segmentation, which is a distant but important topic related to the original query on dorsal patterning.\n\nApplying the technique systematically, I adjust my approach by considering how each step reveals new insights. For instance, recognizing the importance of Hox genes in segmentation leads me to think about their role in broader developmental processes, which actually reminds me of the related concept of morphogen gradients and how they might influence cell fate decisions. Occasional reconsiderations, like realizing the need to focus more on the interplay between different signaling pathways, help refine the expansion process.\n\nThrough this systematic application and exploration of related threads, I start to see how terms like \"ADMP,\" \"Chordin,\" \"BMP,\" \"segmentation,\" \"Hox genes,\" and \"transcription regulatory\" could form a cohesive and expanded query. Applying the specific aspect of the technique focusing on depth expansion leads me to discover terms like \"parasegmental organization\" and \"pair-rule genes,\" which provide a deeper understanding of the developmental processes involved.\n\nI just had a realization that connects to what we were exploring earlier - the importance of axial patterning and how these activator-inhibitor pairs might influence the formation of the neural tube and mesoderm. Following the technique pointed me toward the role of Hox genes, but my instinct says we should also consider the broader context of developmental biology, especially how cell fate is determined through complex interactions of signaling molecules.\n\nSynthesizing all these insights, I believe the terms that would be most effective for an expanded query, especially targeting a BM25 index, would include those from the depth expansion, ensuring they capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking. Thus, the final expanded query, considering all the guidelines and the process of expansion, would include terms that reflect the systematic application of the technique while also incorporating natural, intuitive leaps and connections made during the thought process.",
