  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query regarding the severity of cardiac involvement in amyloidosis as described by the degree of transmurality of late gadolinium enhancement in MRI, this makes me think of how critical it is to quantify the correlation between these imaging findings and disease severity. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the clinical implications of this relationship, it seems like there's an underlying need to identify specific patterns or biomarkers that could help in managing amyloidosis. \n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here, but to approach this systematically, I'll use a technique that involves analyzing the query's objectives, identifying ineffective terms, and then expanding the query through breadth and depth analyses. This should help because it will allow us to explore related concepts and specific terms that are both diverse and targeted, enhancing the search's precision and relevance.\n\nStarting with the breadth expansion, terms like cardiac function assessment, disease staging, imaging biomarkers, prognostic factors, and therapeutic targets come into play. These are broad but relevant areas that could encompass the original query's intent. However, to truly augment the query, we need to dive deeper into one of these areas. Let's consider \"imaging biomarkers\" since it directly relates to the use of LGE in assessing cardiac involvement in amyloidosis.\n\nAs I delve into the depth expansion, focusing on imaging biomarkers, I'm led to consider LGE signal intensity, regional wall motion abnormalities, diastolic dysfunction, and ejection fraction. These terms are more specific and directly related to the assessment of cardiac function in the context of amyloidosis. It's interesting to see how these specific factors can provide insights into the disease's severity and progression.\n\nApplying the expansion technique systematically, I notice that terms like \"regional wall motion,\" \"diastolic dysfunction,\" and \"ejection fraction\" are not only specific but also diverse and non-overlapping with the original query's terms. The inclusion of \"LGE signal intensity\" further enhances the query by directly relating it to the imaging aspect of cardiac involvement in amyloidosis.\n\nThrough this process of applying the expansion technique and exploring related threads, I believe the terms that would be most effective for an augmented query are those that capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking. The final augmented query emerges from a combination of systematic analysis and intuitive connections, ensuring it is both targeted and relevant.",
