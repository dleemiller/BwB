  "thought_process": "The user is searching for information on why articles published in open access format are less likely to be cited than traditional journals. I need to uncover optimal search terms to use with the BM25 algorithm by determining the intent of their search. The user seems to be looking for factors that contribute to the disparity in citation rates between open access and traditional publications.\n\nTo expand this query, I will play the mind game of \"expansion technique\" which involves applying varied augmentation techniques such as synonym replacement, conceptual expansion, contextual expansion, and domain-specific terminology. This technique allows me to discover new, relevant documents across various domains and create a novel augmented query that is free from overlapping the original terms.\n\nFirst, I will examine the original query to understand its primary objectives and gaps. The user wants to understand the reasons behind the lower citation rates of open access articles compared to traditional journals. This implies a focus on factors influencing scholarly impact and the potential barriers to visibility or recognition faced by open access publications.\n\nNext, I will identify broad or non-precise terms that should be avoided, such as \"published\" and \"articles\". These terms are too general and may not provide relevant results.\n\nThen, I will perform breadth expansion by listing candidate terms with increasingly distant concepts to the original query. This includes terms such as \"impact factor\", \"peer review\", \"visibility\", \"accessibility\", \"dissemination\", \"research funding\", \"author recognition\", \"digital repositories\", and \"scholarly communication\".\n\nAfter that, I will choose one distant but important topic from the breadth expansion, which is \"visibility\", and go increasingly deeper in the related terms on that one selection. This leads to terms such as \"discoverability\", \"search engine optimization\", \"indexation\", \"metadata standards\", \"online platforms\", \"community engagement\", and \"citation practices\".\n\nBy applying the expansion technique, I have uncovered a set of high-quality search terms that are specific, diverse, and relevant to the original query. These terms include \"impact factor\", \"peer review\", \"discoverability\", \"search engine optimization\", \"metadata standards\", \"online platforms\", and \"citation practices\".\n\nTherefore, the optimal BM25 search terms are impact factor, peer review, discoverability, search engine optimization, metadata standards, online platforms, citation practices.",
