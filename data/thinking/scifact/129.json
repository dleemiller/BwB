  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"Articles published in open access format are less likely to be cited than traditional journals,\" this makes me think of the disparities in citation rates between open access and traditional publications. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the underlying factors contributing to these disparities, such as visibility, accessibility, and the impact of digital platforms on scholarly communication. Hmm, not sure yet, but it seems like the query is touching on issues of scholarly impact, barriers to recognition, and possibly the role of publishing formats in citation outcomes.\n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here, but to approach this systematically, let me use the expansion technique, which involves identifying gaps in the original query, recognizing ineffective terms, and then applying breadth and depth expansion to uncover relevant and diverse terms. This should help because it will allow us to explore various dimensions of the query, from the factors influencing citation rates to the broader context of scholarly communication and digital publishing.\n\nStarting with goal elucidation and gaps, the primary objective is to understand why open access articles have lower citation rates. A gap in the query is the lack of specificity regarding the factors that could influence these rates, such as peer review processes, impact factor considerations, and the role of online platforms in article dissemination.\n\nMoving on to ineffective term identification, terms like \"published\" and \"articles\" are too broad and don't add much specificity to the query. These terms should be avoided in the expansion to ensure we're targeting more precise and relevant concepts.\n\nFor breadth expansion, we consider terms that introduce new dimensions to the query, such as \"impact factor,\" \"peer review,\" \"visibility,\" \"accessibility,\" \"dissemination,\" \"research funding,\" \"author recognition,\" \"digital repositories,\" and \"scholarly communication.\" These terms start to paint a picture of the various factors at play in the citation disparity between open access and traditional journals.\n\nThen, for depth expansion, choosing a term like \"visibility\" allows us to dive deeper into related concepts such as \"discoverability,\" \"search engine optimization,\" \"indexation,\" \"metadata standards,\" \"online platforms,\" \"community engagement,\" and \"citation practices.\" This depth expansion provides a nuanced understanding of how visibility, or the lack thereof, might impact citation rates for open access articles.\n\nAs I apply the expansion technique, I notice that terms from the depth expansion, such as \"discoverability,\" \"search engine optimization,\" and \"metadata standards,\" offer a lot of insight into the potential reasons for lower citation rates. These terms are about how easily accessible and findable the articles are, which directly influences their citation potential. Additionally, considering \"impact factor,\" \"peer review,\" and \"citation practices\" from the breadth expansion adds another layer of understanding, focusing on the quality, credibility, and the citation process itself.\n\nThrough this process of applying the expansion technique and exploring related threads, I believe the terms that would be most effective for a search query are those that capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking. Terms like \"impact factor,\" \"peer review,\" \"discoverability,\" \"search engine optimization,\" \"metadata standards,\" \"online platforms,\" and \"citation practices\" not only reflect the systematic approach of the technique but also incorporate intuitive connections and insights gained from considering the broader context of scholarly communication and digital publishing.",
