  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query \"Insomnia can be effectively treated with cognitive behavioral therapy,\" my initial impression is that the user is seeking information on the efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for treating insomnia. However, the phrase \"can be effectively treated\" seems somewhat generic and might not yield the most specific or relevant results. The user might actually be trying to understand the mechanisms behind CBT's effectiveness in insomnia treatment or explore other applications of CBT in the realm of sleep disorders.\n\nTo approach this query expansion, I'll utilize a structured technique that involves a combination of synonym replacement, conceptual expansion, and domain-specific terminology. This should help in discovering new, relevant documents across various domains without overlapping the original terms.\n\nFirst, I identify the primary objectives of the query, which are to understand the effectiveness of CBT for insomnia and explore its applications beyond just weight loss. There's a gap in the query regarding the specific aspects of CBT that are beneficial for insomnia, as well as other potential psychological therapies that could be effective.\n\nThe ineffective terms in the query are \"insomnia can be effectively treated,\" as they are broad and don't provide much specificity for the search. For breadth expansion, I consider terms like \"sleep disorders,\" \"psychological therapies,\" \"behavioral interventions,\" \"stress management,\" \"anxiety reduction,\" and \"depression treatment.\" These terms introduce new dimensions to the query by exploring related conditions and therapeutic approaches.\n\nFor depth expansion, I select \"stress management\" as a key area to delve deeper into, given its relevance to both insomnia and CBT. From here, I explore terms like \"stress management techniques,\" \"mindfulness exercises,\" \"relaxation strategies,\" \"sleep hygiene practices,\" \"cognitive restructuring,\" and \"exposure therapy.\" These terms not only provide a deeper understanding of stress management but also connect back to the original query's focus on CBT for insomnia, offering a more nuanced and targeted approach to the search.\n\nAs I apply these expansion techniques, I'm drawn to the connections between mindfulness exercises and relaxation strategies in reducing stress and potentially improving sleep quality. This reminds me of the importance of sleep hygiene practices in managing insomnia, which can be enhanced through cognitive restructuring techniques. The application of exposure therapy, often used in CBT, also emerges as a relevant term, given its potential in addressing underlying issues contributing to insomnia.\n\nThrough this process, I realize that the terms emerging from the depth expansion, such as \"stress management techniques,\" \"mindfulness exercises,\" \"relaxation strategies,\" \"sleep hygiene practices,\" \"cognitive restructuring,\" and \"exposure therapy,\" capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking. These terms are specific, diverse, and relevant, offering a novel and targeted approach to exploring the effectiveness of CBT for insomnia and its broader applications.",
