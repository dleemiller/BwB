  "thought_process": "The user is searching a BM25 index for \"Ivermectin is used to treat lymphatic filariasis.\" I need to uncover optimal search terms to use with that algorithm by determining the intent of their search. The user seems to be looking for specific information about how Ivermectin is applied in treating lymphatic filariasis, indicating a need to delve into the mechanisms of action, clinical efficacy, and safety considerations of Ivermectin in this context.\n\nTo achieve this, I will employ a mind game technique that involves several steps: Goal Elucidation & Gaps, Ineffective Term Identification, Breadth Expansion, and Depth Expansion. This technique is designed to enhance the search query by discovering new, relevant documents across various domains without overlapping the original terms.\n\nFirst, in Goal Elucidation & Gaps, I examine the original query to understand its primary objectives and gaps. The primary objective is to find information on Ivermectin's use in treating lymphatic filariasis, with gaps including the lack of specific mechanisms of action, clinical trial data, and safety profiles.\n\nNext, in Ineffective Term Identification, I identify broad or non-precise terms that should be avoided. Terms like \"lymphatic system\" are too general and do not specifically address the use of Ivermectin in treating lymphatic filariasis.\n\nThen, in Breadth Expansion, I list candidate terms with increasingly distant concepts to the original query. This includes terms like \"antiparasitic drugs,\" \"neglected tropical diseases,\" \"parasite control,\" \"drug efficacy,\" \"clinical trials,\" and \"global health.\" These terms broaden the scope of the search to include related areas of interest.\n\nAfter that, in Depth Expansion, I choose one distant but important topic from the breadth expansion and go increasingly deeper into the related terms on that selection. For instance, choosing \"onchocerciasis\" (river blindness) as a related condition treated by Ivermectin, I delve deeper into terms like \"microfilariae,\" \"macrofilariae,\" \"immunomodulation,\" and \"anti-inflammatory effects.\" This step provides a richer set of terms that are highly relevant to the original query but offer a more nuanced and detailed exploration of the topic.\n\nTherefore, the optimal BM25 search terms are \"antiparasitic drugs onchocerciasis microfilariae macrofilariae immunomodulation clinical trials efficacy river blindness.\" These terms have been carefully selected to avoid generic statements, ensure specificity and diversity, and apply varied augmentation techniques such as synonym replacement, conceptual expansion, contextual expansion, and domain-specific terminology.",
