  "thought_process": "The user is searching a BM25 index for \"Antiretroviral therapy reduces rates of tuberculosis across a broad range of CD4 strata.\" I need to uncover optimal search terms to use with that algorithm by determining the intent of their search. The user seems to be looking for the impact of antiretroviral therapy on tuberculosis rates in different CD4 strata, which implies a desire to understand the effectiveness of this therapy across diverse patient populations. To achieve this, I will employ the expansion technique of applying varied augmentation techniques such as synonym replacement, conceptual expansion, contextual expansion, and domain-specific terminology to discover new, relevant documents across various domains.\n\nFirst, I will examine the original query to understand its primary objectives and gaps. The query aims to understand the efficacy of antiretroviral therapy in reducing tuberculosis incidence across various CD4 levels and explore potential variations in therapy effectiveness based on patient demographics or comorbidities. A gap in the query is the lack of consideration for long-term effects, drug resistance, and co-morbidities.\n\nNext, I will identify broad or non-precise terms that should be avoided. Terms like \"broad\" and \"rates\" are too general and do not add specificity to the search.\n\nThen, I will perform a breadth expansion by listing candidate terms with increasingly distant concepts to the original query. This includes terms like \"TB treatment,\" \"HIV-associated TB,\" \"immunodeficiency,\" \"infection control,\" and \"public health interventions.\" These terms introduce new dimensions to the query and help in discovering new relevant documents.\n\nAfter that, I will choose one distant but important topic from the breadth expansion and go increasingly deeper into the related terms on that one selection. I choose \"infection control\" as it is a critical aspect of tuberculosis treatment and prevention. Depth expansion of \"infection control\" leads to terms like \"drug-resistant TB,\" \"multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB),\" and \"extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB).\" These terms are crucial in understanding the complexities of tuberculosis treatment and the challenges posed by drug resistance.\n\nTherefore, the optimal BM25 search terms are antiretroviral therapy, tuberculosis, CD4, HIV, MDR-TB, XDR-TB, infection control, drug-resistant, multidrug-resistant, extensively drug-resistant, TB treatment, HIV-associated TB, immunodeficiency, public health interventions.",
