  "thought_process": "The user is searching a BM25 index for \"The center of the granuloma in an immune cell induces a pro-inflammatory immune response.\" I need to uncover optimal search terms to use with that algorithm by determining the intent of their search. The user seems to be looking for the specific mechanisms by which the center of an immune cell granuloma triggers a pro-inflammatory immune response, focusing on cellular components and molecular mediators involved in this process.\n\nTo expand the query, I'll be playing the mind game of \"Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal.\" This technique involves constructing a conceptual graph based on the original query and then traversing it to find semantically relevant terms for expansion. The process starts with query analysis, where I identify core concepts (granuloma, immune cell, pro-inflammatory immune response) and determine the search intent (informational, seeking to understand a specific biological mechanism).\n\nNext, I construct a conceptual graph with core nodes (granuloma, immune cell), first-order connections (cellular components like macrophages and T cells, molecular mediators like cytokines), and second-order connections (inflammation, immune response, signaling pathways). I also consider domain contexts (immunology, cell biology) to refine the graph.\n\nFor expansion path selection, I identify promising directions such as synonymous terms (e.g., \"inflammatory mediators\" instead of \"pro-inflammatory immune response\"), hierarchical terms (e.g., \"cytokines\" as a broader concept including TNF-alpha and IL-1beta), compositional terms (e.g., \"granuloma center\" components), contextual terms (e.g., \"immune response in granuloma\"), and domain-specific terminology (e.g., \"signal transduction\" in immunology).\n\nTraversing the graph, I extract high-value terms like \"macrophages,\" \"T cells,\" \"TNF-alpha,\" \"IL-1beta,\" \"cytokines,\" \"inflammation,\" \"signal transduction,\" and \"granuloma formation.\" These terms are filtered based on relevance, distinctiveness, specificity, and searchability, ensuring they maintain the original search intent while offering alternative pathways for retrieval.\n\nTherefore, the optimal BM25 search terms are macrophages, T cells, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, cytokines, inflammation, signal transduction, granuloma, immune cell, and pro-inflammatory.",
