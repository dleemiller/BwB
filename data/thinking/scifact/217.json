  "thought_process": "The user is searching a BM25 index for \"CX3CR1 on the Th2 cells promotes T cell survival\". I need to uncover optimal search terms to use with that algorithm by determining the intent of their search. The user seems to be looking for the role of CX3CR1 in promoting Th2 cell survival, particularly in the context of allergic asthma. To achieve this, I'll be playing the mind game of \"conceptual expansion\" - a technique that involves exploring related concepts and ideas to uncover new search terms.\n\nFirst, I'll examine the original query to understand its primary objectives and gaps. The query seeks to understand the role of CX3CR1 in promoting Th2 cell survival, which suggests that the user is interested in the mechanisms underlying this process. However, the existing results lack direct experimental evidence linking CX3CR1 to this specific function, indicating a gap in the current knowledge.\n\nNext, I'll identify broad or non-precise terms that should be avoided. Terms like \"CX3CR1\", \"on\", and \"cells\" are too general and may not provide specific enough results. I'll set these aside and focus on more targeted expansions.\n\nNow, I'll move on to breadth expansion, where I'll explore increasingly distant concepts related to the original query. This includes terms like \"T helper cells\", \"allergic inflammation\", \"cytokine signaling\", \"chemokine receptors\", \"immune regulation\", \"apoptosis\", and \"cell survival pathways\". These terms introduce new dimensions to the query and provide a broader context for understanding the role of CX3CR1 in Th2 cell survival.\n\nFrom the breadth expansion, I'll choose one distant but important topic and go increasingly deeper into related terms. I'll select \"cytokine signaling\" as the topic and explore terms like \"IL-4 pathway\", \"STAT6 activation\", \"transcriptional regulation\", \"Bcl-2 family\", and \"anti-apoptotic proteins\". These terms provide a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying CX3CR1's role in Th2 cell survival.\n\nTherefore, the optimal BM25 search terms are T helper cells, allergic inflammation, IL-4 pathway, STAT6 activation, Bcl-2 family, anti-apoptotic proteins.",
