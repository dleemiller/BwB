  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"Leuko-increased blood increases infectious complications in red blood cell transfusion,\" this makes me think of the complexities involved in blood transfusions and how leucocytes play a significant role in the immune response. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the specific mechanisms by which increased leucocytes in transfused blood lead to higher infection rates, I'm not sure yet how deeply they want to dive into immunology or transfusion medicine.\n\nAs I consider the query, I start to see several possibilities for expansion. The terms \"leucocytes,\" \"infection risk,\" and \"red blood cell transfusion\" stand out as core concepts that need to be explored further. However, to systematically approach this, I'll use the Conceptual Graph Traversal technique for query expansion. This involves constructing a conceptual graph that includes core nodes (direct entities/concepts from the query), first and second-order connections, and domain contexts. \n\nThe first step in this process is query analysis. Here, I identify \"leucocytes,\" \"blood transfusion,\" and \"infectious complications\" as core concepts. The search intent seems informational, aiming to understand the relationship between leucocytes in transfused blood and the risk of infections. An implicit assumption is that the role of leucocytes in the immune response is crucial to this relationship.\n\nNext, I'll construct the conceptual graph. Core nodes include \"leucocytes,\" \"blood transfusion,\" and \"infections.\" First-order connections involve the relationships between these nodes, such as how leucocytes affect the immune response during a transfusion. Second-order connections bring in related concepts like \"immune system,\" \"complications,\" and \"red blood cells.\" The domain context is clearly within transfusion medicine and immunology.\n\nFor expansion path selection, I identify several promising directions: \n- Synonymous terms, like \"white blood cells\" for \"leucocytes,\"\n- Hierarchical terms, such as \"hematopoietic cells\" as a broader concept for \"leucocytes,\"\n- Compositional terms, including \"granulocytes\" and \"lymphocytes\" as components of leucocytes,\n- Contextual terms, like \"transfusion-related infections\" or \"immunological complications,\"\n- Domain-specific terminology, such as \"leukoreduction\" in the context of preventing transfusion-related complications.\n\nWhen extracting and filtering terms, I look for relevance, distinctiveness, specificity, and searchability. Terms like \"leukocyte antigens,\" \"immune modulation,\" \"transfusion medicine,\" and \"haematology\" emerge as strong candidates. They are semantically connected to the original query, offer a distinct perspective, are specific, and are likely to appear in relevant documents.\n\nThrough this process of applying Conceptual Graph Traversal and exploring related threads, I believe these terms would be most effective for enhancing the query: \"leucocytes, white blood cells, infection risk, complications, immune response, red blood cell transfusion, leukoreduction, transfusion medicine, immunological risks.\" They capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, which is to understand how increased leucocytes in blood transfusions can lead to higher infectious complications and to explore the immune system's role in this context.",
