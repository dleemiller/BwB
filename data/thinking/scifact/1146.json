  "reasoning": "The original query implies a comparison of care quality between teaching and non-teaching hospitals, primarily focusing on mortality rates.  While the existing research provides a solid foundation, it lacks depth in exploring other crucial aspects of healthcare quality and suffers from the limitations of observational studies. \n\nTo enhance the search, we need to: 1) broaden the scope beyond mortality, encompassing patient experience and access to specialized services; 2) consider alternative study designs that can establish causality; 3) explore potential confounding factors influencing the observed differences.",

  "thought_process": "The user is searching for a comparison of care quality between teaching and non-teaching hospitals, specifically looking at the statement \"Teaching hospitals do not provide better care than non-teaching hospitals.\" I need to uncover optimal search terms to use by determining the intent of their search. The user seems to be looking for a nuanced understanding of healthcare quality, beyond just mortality rates, and is interested in aspects such as patient experience, access to specialized services, and the potential for study designs that can establish causality.\n\nTo enhance this query, I will play a mind game using the expansion technique provided, which involves several steps: goal elucidation and gaps identification, ineffective term identification, breadth expansion, and depth expansion. \n\nFirst, I identify the primary objectives and gaps in the original query. The main goal is to compare care quality, but there's a gap in exploring other crucial aspects of healthcare quality and in considering alternative study designs. \n\nNext, I list broad or non-precise terms that should be avoided, such as \"better\" and \"provide,\" as they do not add specificity to the search.\n\nThen, I perform a breadth expansion by listing candidate terms with increasingly distant concepts to the original query. These include terms like \"patient satisfaction,\" \"healthcare access,\" \"specialized services,\" \"randomized controlled trials,\" \"longitudinal studies,\" \"confounding variables,\" \"socioeconomic factors,\" and \"health outcomes.\"\n\nFollowing this, I choose one distant but important topic from the breadth expansion, \"patient experience,\" and go deeper into related terms. This depth expansion includes terms like \"patient surveys,\" \"hospital ratings,\" \"communication with physicians,\" \"wait times,\" \"emotional support,\" \"complications after discharge,\" and \"readmission rates.\"\n\nBy applying this expansion technique, I have uncovered a rich set of terms that can enhance the original query. Therefore, the optimal search terms are patient experience, patient surveys, hospital ratings, communication, physicians, wait times, emotional support, complications, readmissions.",
