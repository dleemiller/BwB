While existing results touch upon ubiquitination's role in growth cone function, they lack a direct comparison as stated. The focus should shift from general ubiquitination mechanisms to specific aspects related to local protein turnover and regulation at these cellular compartments.",

  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"Proteins synthesized at the growth cone are ubiquitinated at a higher rate than proteins from the cell body,\" this makes me think of the complex processes involved in protein synthesis and degradation within cells, particularly the role of ubiquitination in marking proteins for degradation. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the specific mechanisms or regulatory elements that lead to this difference in ubiquitination rates between growth cones and cell bodies, the initial query seems to lack specificity in terms of the pathways or components involved. \n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here, but to approach this systematically, let me use the expansion technique outlined, which involves identifying ineffective terms, expanding the query through both breadth and depth, and ensuring the final query is novel, diverse, and free from overlapping original terms. This should help because it allows us to pinpoint specific aspects of protein ubiquitination and its regulation in growth cones versus cell bodies, potentially uncovering more targeted information.\n\nStarting with the ineffective terms, we've identified \"proteins,\" \"ubiquitinated,\" and \"metabolic\" as too broad or non-precise. These terms are indeed too general and could lead to a vast amount of irrelevant information. The next step involves breadth expansion, where we consider terms like \"degradation,\" \"proteasome,\" \"lysosome,\" \"signaling pathways,\" \"actin cytoskeleton,\" \"axon guidance,\" and \"neurodevelopment.\" These terms start to get at the specific mechanisms and contexts relevant to the query.\n\nFor depth expansion, focusing on the \"proteasome\" seems promising, as it directly relates to protein degradation, a key aspect of ubiquitination. Drilling down, we consider \"26S proteasome,\" \"ubiquitin ligases,\" \"deubiquitinases,\" and \"protein degradation pathways.\" This level of specificity should help in identifying documents that discuss the finer points of protein ubiquitination in the context of growth cones and cell bodies.\n\nAs I apply this structured approach, I'm also considering natural connections and potential tangents. For instance, the role of the actin cytoskeleton in axon guidance and how ubiquitination might affect cytoskeletal dynamics is an interesting thread. However, staying focused on the task, the augmented query needs to reflect the depth expansion around the proteasome and related regulatory components.\n\nThrough this process of applying the expansion technique and exploring related threads, I believe the terms that would be most effective for the augmented query are those that reflect the specific mechanisms of protein ubiquitination and degradation in growth cones, avoiding the overly broad terms and focusing on the depth expansion around the proteasome and its related pathways.",
