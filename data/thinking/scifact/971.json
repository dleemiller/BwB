  "thought_process": "The user is searching a BM25 index for \"Primary cervical cancer screening with HPV detection has higher longitudinal sensitivity than conventional cytology to detect cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2.\" I need to uncover optimal search terms to use with that algorithm by determining the intent of their search. The user seems to be looking for a comparison between HPV detection and conventional cytology in terms of longitudinal sensitivity for detecting cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2, which suggests they are interested in the effectiveness of different screening methods for cervical cancer.\n\nTo expand on this query, I will apply the \"Query Expansion Through Journalistic Investigation\" technique. This involves treating the query as if I were a journalist researching a story, looking for real-world contexts, expert opinions, and detailed information that can shed more light on the topic.\n\nFirst, I assess the query to understand what the user is truly seeking. They want to know about the longitudinal sensitivity of HPV detection compared to conventional cytology, which implies they are looking for information on how these methods perform over time in detecting cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2.\n\nNext, I consider real-world contexts where this query is relevant. This could include professional contexts such as gynecology or oncology, educational settings like medical schools, personal situations where individuals are concerned about cervical cancer screening, and specialized communities of healthcare professionals and researchers.\n\nI then investigate resources and authorities on this topic. Notable experts might include oncologists, gynecologists, and epidemiologists who have published studies on cervical cancer screening. Essential terminology includes \"HPV detection,\" \"conventional cytology,\" \"longitudinal sensitivity,\" \"cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2,\" and \"cervical cancer screening guidelines.\"\n\nCreating headlines for articles that address the query from different angles helps to extract more specific terms. For example, \"New Study Compares Longitudinal Sensitivity of HPV Detection and Conventional Cytology in Cervical Cancer Screening,\" \"Understanding the Role of HPV Vaccination in Cervical Cancer Prevention,\" or \"Updated Guidelines for Cervical Cancer Screening: What You Need to Know.\"\n\nFrom these headlines and the investigative process, I extract specific terms that represent precise concepts related to the query, such as \"HPV detection,\" \"conventional cytology,\" \"longitudinal sensitivity,\" \"cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2,\" \"age-specific effectiveness,\" \"HPV vaccination programs,\" and \"cervical cancer screening guidelines.\"\n\nTherefore, the optimal BM25 search terms are HPV detection, conventional cytology, longitudinal sensitivity, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, age-specific effectiveness, HPV vaccination, cervical cancer incidence, cervical cancer mortality, screening guidelines, and HPV testing methods.",
