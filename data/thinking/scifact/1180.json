  "thought_process": "The user is searching a BM25 index for \"The PRR MDA5 is a sensor of RNA virus infection.\" I need to uncover optimal search terms to use with that algorithm by determining the intent of their search. The user seems to be looking for information on the role of PRR MDA5 in detecting RNA virus infections, which involves understanding its function, historical development, and current applications.\n\nTo expand this query, I am playing the mind game of \"Query Expansion via Temporal Evolution Analysis.\" This technique involves analyzing how the query topic has evolved through time to discover temporally diverse terminology. \n\nFirst, I consider the historical foundation of PRR MDA5, tracing its origins and early development. This includes identifying foundational concepts such as the recognition of viral RNA as a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) and the discovery of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) as key players in innate immunity. I note the historical approaches and methodologies that are now considered classic, such as the identification of RIG-I and MDA5 as cytoplasmic RNA sensors.\n\nNext, I map the key developmental milestones in the topic's development, including the characterization of MDA5 structure and function, the elucidation of the MDA5 signaling pathway, and the discovery of specific viral RNA motifs recognized by MDA5. I identify breakthrough moments that changed terminology or approaches, such as the development of MDA5-targeting therapies for viral infections.\n\nThen, I assess the current landscape of PRR MDA5 research, identifying current best practices and leading approaches. This includes understanding the role of RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) as primary sensors of cytoplasmic viral RNA, MDA5's critical role in sensing long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), and the signaling cascade activation through MAVS, IRF3, and NF-\u03baB.\n\nI also project how this topic is likely to evolve, identifying emerging trends such as investigating the specificity of MDA5 for different viral RNA structures, exploring the role of MDA5 in modulating the adaptive immune response, and developing novel MDA5 agonists or antagonists as therapeutic agents against viral infections.\n\nFinally, I compile terminology from each time period, identifying terms that have remained relevant across eras and selecting terms that provide historical context or future relevance. This includes terms such as PRR, MDA5, cytoplasmic viral RNA sensor, RIG-I-like receptor (RLR), long dsRNA, interferon production, antiviral response, MAVS, IRF3, NF-\u03baB, and therapeutic targeting.\n\nTherefore, the optimal BM25 search terms are PRR, MDA5, cytoplasmic viral RNA sensor, RIG-I-like receptor, long dsRNA, interferon production, antiviral response, MAVS, IRF3, NF-\u03baB, therapeutic targeting.",
