  "thought_process": "The user is searching a BM25 index for \"In young and middle-aged adults, current or remote uses of ADHD medications do not increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events.\" I need to uncover optimal search terms to use with that algorithm by determining the intent of their search. The user seems to be looking for a deeper understanding of how ADHD medications impact cardiovascular health in adults, considering both short-term and long-term effects.\n\nTo expand this query, I will play the mind game of \"expansion technique,\" which involves applying various augmentation techniques such as synonym replacement, conceptual expansion, contextual expansion, and domain-specific terminology. This game requires me to think creatively about the query, identifying gaps and ineffective terms, and then broadening and deepening the search terms to capture a more comprehensive set of relevant documents.\n\nFirst, I examine the original query to understand its primary objectives and gaps. The query focuses on the relationship between ADHD medication use and cardiovascular risks in adults, but it has gaps in terms of considering broader aspects of medication use patterns, individual health factors, and long-term cardiovascular outcomes.\n\nNext, I identify broad or non-precise terms that should be avoided, such as \"current,\" \"remote,\" and \"serious.\" These terms are too vague and may not effectively capture the desired search results.\n\nThen, I perform a breadth expansion by listing candidate terms with increasingly distant concepts to the original query. This includes terms such as \"long-term health effects,\" \"mental health comorbidities,\" \"lifestyle factors,\" \"pharmacogenetics,\" and \"cardiovascular disease subtypes.\" These terms introduce new dimensions to the query and help to capture a wider range of relevant documents.\n\nAfter that, I choose one distant but important topic from the breadth expansion, which is \"mental health comorbidities,\" and go increasingly deeper in the related terms on that topic. This includes terms such as \"depression,\" \"anxiety,\" \"stress,\" \"sleep disorders,\" and \"arrhythmias.\" These terms are more specific and targeted, and they help to capture a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between ADHD medications and cardiovascular health.\n\nFinally, I combine the terms from the breadth expansion and depth expansion to create an augmented query that is novel, diverse, and relevant to the original query. This includes terms such as \"long-term health effects,\" \"mental health comorbidities,\" \"depression,\" \"anxiety,\" \"stress,\" \"sleep disorders,\" \"heart disease,\" \"hypertension,\" \"arrhythmias,\" and \"pharmacogenetics.\"\n\nTherefore, the optimal BM25 search terms are long-term health effects mental health comorbidities depression anxiety stress sleep disorders heart disease hypertension arrhythmias pharmacogenetics.",
