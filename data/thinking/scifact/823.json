  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"N348I mutations cause resistance to zidovudine (AZT),\" this makes me think of the complex mechanisms of drug resistance in HIV treatment. The user might actually be trying to understand the molecular basis of how certain mutations affect the efficacy of antiretroviral drugs like zidovudine. However, the query seems to focus narrowly on a specific mutation and drug, which might limit the scope of relevant information that can be uncovered.\n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here, but to expand this query effectively, I need to approach it using a systematic technique. Let me use the expansion technique provided, which involves identifying ineffective terms, performing breadth expansion, and then depth expansion. This should help because it allows for a structured exploration of related concepts, increasing the chances of discovering novel and relevant information.\n\nFirst, I identify the ineffective terms, which are \"N348I mutations\" and \"zidovudine (AZT)\" themselves, as they are too specific and might not yield a broad range of relevant results. For breadth expansion, I consider terms that are increasingly distant from the original query but still relevant, such as \"viral resistance mechanisms,\" \"HIV reverse transcriptase,\" \"antiretroviral drug efficacy,\" and \"pharmacogenomics.\" These terms open up the query to include a wider range of topics related to drug resistance and HIV treatment.\n\nNext, for depth expansion, I choose one of these distant but important topics, \"HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitors,\" and delve deeper into related terms such as \"nucleoside analogs,\" \"proviral DNA replication,\" and \"genetic diversity of HIV.\" This step is crucial because it allows me to drill down into specific areas that are crucial for understanding the complexities of HIV drug resistance and potential therapeutic interventions.\n\nFollowing the expansion technique, I apply synonym replacement, conceptual expansion, and contextual expansion. For instance, considering \"nucleoside analogs\" leads me to think about other types of antiretroviral drugs and how they interact with the HIV virus, which in turn reminds me of the importance of \"drug target interactions\" and \"mutation analysis\" in understanding resistance mechanisms.\n\nAt this point, I'm noticing a pattern where the depth expansion is revealing a rich landscape of interconnected concepts. The technique is helping to systematically uncover these relationships, but my intuition is also playing a role in making connections between seemingly disparate pieces of information. For example, the concept of \"genetic diversity of HIV\" intuitively connects to \"treatment strategies for resistant HIV,\" highlighting the importance of considering the evolving nature of the virus in developing effective treatment plans.\n\nThrough this process of applying the expansion technique and exploring related threads, I believe the following terms would be most effective for expanding the query: \"HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitors,\" \"nucleoside analogs,\" \"proviral DNA replication,\" \"genetic diversity of HIV,\" \"drug target interactions,\" and \"pharmacogenomics.\" These terms capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, providing a balanced approach to understanding the molecular basis of AZT resistance and exploring potential therapeutic interventions.\n\nThe final augmented query, therefore, should include these high-quality search terms, ensuring they are unique, diverse, and relevant to the original query without using logical operators or duplicating terms.",
