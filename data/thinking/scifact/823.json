  "thought_process": "The user is searching a BM25 index for \"N348I mutations cause resistance to zidovudine (AZT)\". I need to uncover optimal search terms to use with that algorithm by determining the intent of their search. The user seems to be looking for research that explores the molecular mechanisms behind the resistance of N348I mutations to zidovudine (AZT), which is an antiretroviral drug used to treat HIV.\n\nTo expand this query, I will play the mind game of \"conceptual expansion\" which involves identifying related concepts and terminology in the domain of HIV treatment and antiretroviral therapy. This technique requires me to think about the broader context of the query and identify key concepts, entities, and relationships that can help me uncover new and relevant search terms.\n\nFirst, I will examine the original query to understand its primary objectives and gaps. The query is focused on understanding the relationship between N348I mutations and resistance to zidovudine (AZT), but it lacks specificity and context. To address this gap, I will identify ineffective terms that should be avoided, such as \"N348I mutations\" and \"zidovudine (AZT)\", as they are too broad and may not yield relevant results.\n\nNext, I will perform a breadth expansion by identifying candidate terms with increasingly distant concepts to the original query. This includes terms such as \"viral resistance mechanisms\", \"HIV reverse transcriptase\", \"antiretroviral drug efficacy\", \"drug target interactions\", \"pharmacogenomics\", \"mutation analysis\", and \"clinical trials\". These terms provide a broader context for the query and can help me identify new and relevant search terms.\n\nThen, I will perform a depth expansion by choosing one distant but important topic from the breadth expansion and going increasingly deeper in the related terms. I will choose \"HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitors\" as the topic and expand on it by identifying related terms such as \"nucleoside analogs\", \"proviral DNA replication\", and \"genetic diversity of HIV\". These terms provide a more specific and targeted context for the query and can help me identify high-quality search terms.\n\nTherefore, the optimal BM25 search terms are \"HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitors, nucleoside analogs, proviral DNA replication, genetic diversity\".",
