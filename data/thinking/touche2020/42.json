  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"Should fighting be allowed in hockey?\"... this makes me think of the intense debates I've heard among hockey fans and the complex arguments presented by both sides. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the historical context and future implications of fighting in hockey, hmm, not sure yet... It seems like there's a deep-rooted cultural aspect to fighting in hockey, but also a growing concern for player safety and the sport's image.\n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here... Let me approach this using the Temporal Evolution Analysis technique, which involves tracing the development of a topic over time to identify key terminology and concepts from different eras. This should help because understanding how the discussion around fighting in hockey has evolved can provide insights into the current landscape and future directions.\n\nFollowing the Temporal Evolution Analysis approach, I should first identify the historical foundation of fighting in hockey... The early forms of violence, the gentlemanly conduct code, and the emergence of the enforcer role are all crucial. Wait, that's not quite right for this query; I need to consider how these historical elements have influenced the present and future of fighting in hockey. Let me adjust my focus to how the terminology and concepts related to fighting have changed over time.\n\nThis step of the technique is revealing the importance of tracking changes in terminology and concepts, such as the shift from \"violence\" to \"fighting majors\" and the introduction of \"player safety\" as a key concern. Which actually reminds me of the related concept of \"skill-based play\" and how it might be seen as an alternative to the culture of fighting. I need to consider how these concepts intersect and influence each other.\n\nApplying the Temporal Evolution Analysis, I notice that the historical milestones, such as the introduction of rule changes to penalize violence and the emergence of the enforcer role, have significantly impacted the current debate. The ongoing efforts to reduce fighting through rule changes, suspensions, and fines, alongside the growing focus on player wellness and the influence of youth hockey regulations, are all critical aspects. This also makes me think about the potential for technological advancements in tracking and preventing violence, which could be a game-changer.\n\nAs I continue through the process, I realize that identifying emerging trends and projecting how the topic will evolve is essential. The increased emphasis on sport safety, player wellbeing, and the potential for alternative disciplinary systems are all part of this evolution. My instinct says we should also consider the role of predictive analytics and technological interventions in shaping the future of fighting in hockey.\n\nThrough this process of applying Temporal Evolution Analysis and exploring related threads, I believe the terms that would be most effective for query expansion are those that capture the historical context, current landscape, and future directions of fighting in hockey. These include terms like \"hockey fighting history,\" \"evolution of fighting rules,\" \"fighting injuries statistics,\" \"alternatives to fighting in hockey,\" \"player safety regulations,\" and \"future of fighting in hockey.\" They provide a comprehensive view of the topic's temporal spectrum, from its origins to its potential future developments.\n\nI just had a realization that connects to what we were exploring earlier - the importance of understanding the temporal evolution of a topic to effectively expand a query. By tracing the development of concepts and terminology over time, we can identify key areas of interest and concern that might not be immediately apparent from the original query. This approach complements my natural thought process, allowing me to balance structured analysis with intuitive connections and insights.\n\nUpon reflection, the systematic application of the Temporal Evolution Analysis technique, combined with my natural thought patterns and experiences, has led to a more nuanced understanding of the query. The final expanded query terms emerge logically from both the technique and my intuitive insights, demonstrating how structure and intuition can complement each other in the query expansion process.",
