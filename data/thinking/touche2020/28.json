  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"Should prostitution be legal?\", this makes me think of the complex interplay between ethics, law, social norms, health, and economics. The user might be trying to understand the pros and cons of legalization, but it's also possible they're looking for a more nuanced exploration of the issue, considering multiple perspectives and disciplines. \n\nTo approach this, I'll use the Multi-Disciplinary Expert Panel technique, which involves convening a panel of experts from different fields to analyze the query. This technique is beneficial because it allows for a comprehensive understanding of the issue, incorporating various methodologies, specialized knowledge, and terminologies. By doing so, we can identify key concepts that might have been overlooked and synthesize a well-rounded opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to select the experts. For this query, relevant disciplines could include ethics, law, public health, economics, and sociology. So, I'll create an expert persona for each of these fields. For instance, Dr. Maria Rodriguez, an ethicist, can provide insights into the moral implications of legalizing prostitution, while Professor John Taylor, a legal scholar, can discuss the legal frameworks and precedents surrounding prostitution laws.\n\nAs each expert analyzes the query from their disciplinary perspective, they'll identify key concepts and methodologies. Dr. Sophia Patel, the public health specialist, will likely focus on the health risks associated with prostitution and how legalization could impact these, possibly through regulation and access to healthcare services. Meanwhile, Dr. Emily Chen, the economist, will consider the economic benefits and costs, such as taxation and job creation, alongside the potential social costs.\n\nThe panel discussion will be crucial, as it allows the experts to debate and find common ground. They'll identify cross-disciplinary connections\u2014like how economic benefits can be linked to improved health outcomes for sex workers if the industry is properly regulated. They'll also clarify any terminology differences between their fields, ensuring a cohesive understanding of the issue.\n\nEach expert will then provide recommended resources and suggest domain-specific search terms. For example, Dr. David Lee, the sociologist, might recommend studies on the social stigma surrounding prostitution and its impact on sex workers, while also suggesting terms like \"marginalization\" and \"exploitation\" for further exploration.\n\nAs I compile the specialized terminology and identify terms with cross-disciplinary relevance, I'll prioritize those that add new dimensions to the search. Terms like \"sex work,\" \"legalization,\" \"regulation,\" \"exploitation,\" and \"human rights\" will likely be central, alongside \"health risks,\" \"economic benefits,\" \"taxation,\" and \"social costs.\"\n\nThrough this systematic application of the Multi-Disciplinary Expert Panel technique, combined with the natural flow of considering various perspectives and connections, the process reveals a rich tapestry of insights. The technique helps to ensure that no critical aspect of the query is overlooked, from the ethical considerations to the economic implications.\n\nApplying this technique leads to the realization that the query isn't just about the legal status of prostitution but also about how regulation can mitigate exploitation and improve the well-being of sex workers. This understanding emerges from both the structured approach of convening experts and the intuitive connections made between their insights.\n\nThe final expanded query, \"Should prostitution be legalized, considering the ethical, legal, social, health, and economic implications, and how can regulation mitigate exploitation and improve the well-being of sex workers?\" captures the essence of this comprehensive analysis. It reflects the expert panel's contributions, synthesizing their knowledge into a query that is both detailed and nuanced.\n\nIn conclusion, the thought process behind expanding the query \"Should prostitution be legal?\" involves a deep dive into multiple disciplines, leveraging the expertise of scholars from ethics, law, public health, economics, and sociology. By systematically applying the Multi-Disciplinary Expert Panel technique and allowing for the natural integration of insights and connections, we arrive at a refined query that encompasses the complexity of the issue.",
