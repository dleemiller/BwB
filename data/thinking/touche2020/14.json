  "thought_process": "As I delve into the query \"Is sexual orientation determined at birth?\", my initial impression is that this question touches on a deeply personal and complex aspect of human identity. It's a topic that has been debated fiercely, with opinions often influenced by personal beliefs, societal norms, and varying degrees of understanding about sexual orientation. My first thought is to consider what the user might be seeking: factual information about the biological basis of sexual orientation, philosophical perspectives on identity, or perhaps guidance on navigating personal beliefs amidst societal views.\n\nTo approach this query systematically, I'll employ the \"Query Expansion Through Journalistic Investigation\" technique. This involves treating the query as a story to be researched and developed, similar to how a journalist would investigate a topic. The first step in this technique is query assessment, where I analyze what the user is truly seeking. In this case, the user wants to understand the origins of sexual orientation, which could involve biological, psychological, and social factors.\n\nNext, I consider real-world contexts where this query is relevant. This includes professional settings like psychology and medicine, educational environments where sexual health and identity are discussed, personal situations such as individuals questioning their sexual orientation, and specialized communities like LGBTQ+ support groups. Historical contexts, such as the evolution of LGBTQ+ rights and the impact of significant events like the Stonewall Riots, are also crucial.\n\nNow, I move on to resource investigation, identifying authoritative sources and experts in the field. This includes research from psychologists, geneticists, sociologists, and historians who have studied sexual orientation and identity formation. Notable studies, such as the Kinsey Reports, and landmark legal decisions, like Obergefell v. Hodges, provide valuable insights. Essential terminology includes terms like \"sexual orientation,\" \"gender identity,\" \"biological basis,\" and \"social influences,\" as well as methodologies for studying human sexuality and psychological development.\n\nCreating diverse headlines helps to approach the query from multiple angles. For example, \"Unraveling the Mystery of Sexual Orientation: Nature vs. Nurture,\" \"A Historical Perspective on LGBTQ+ Rights and Identity,\" \"The Psychology of Sexual Orientation: Understanding Identity Formation,\" and \"Beyond Binary: Exploring the Spectrum of Human Sexuality\" offer a range of viewpoints. From these headlines, I extract specific terms that represent precise concepts related to the query, such as \"genetic factors,\" \"hormonal influences,\" \"environmental factors,\" \"social norms,\" \"cultural beliefs,\" and \"psychological experiences.\"\n\nAs I apply the journalistic investigation technique, I notice that my thought process is balancing structured steps with natural cognitive patterns. I start with an organic, intuitive approach, considering the complexities and sensitivities of the query, and then systematically apply the technique's steps to uncover a wealth of related terms and concepts. This balance allows me to delve deeper into the query, ensuring that the final expanded query captures both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking.\n\nThrough this process, insights emerge from both the structured technique and my intuitive connections. For instance, applying the technique leads me to consider the historical context of LGBTQ+ rights, which in turn reminds me of the importance of cultural beliefs in shaping identity. This realization complements the technique's emphasis on exploring real-world contexts and authoritative sources.\n\nFinally, synthesizing my findings with clarity, I believe that the terms extracted through this process\u2014such as \"biological basis,\" \"psychological factors,\" \"social influences,\" \"LGBTQ+ rights,\" \"identity formation,\" and \"cultural contexts\"\u2014would be most effective for expanding the query. These terms capture the complexity of sexual orientation, acknowledging both the scientific and societal aspects that influence an individual's identity.",
