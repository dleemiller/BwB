  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"Should performance-enhancing drugs be accepted in sports?\"... this makes me think of the complex ethical dilemmas involved, though the user might actually be trying to understand the various arguments and perspectives surrounding this issue, including health risks, fair play, and individual autonomy. The query seems to be seeking a comprehensive exploration of the topic, considering multiple viewpoints and the potential consequences of accepting or rejecting performance-enhancing drugs in sports.\n\nAs I delve into this query, I start seeing several possibilities here... Let me approach this using the Query Expansion Through Journalistic Investigation technique, which involves analyzing the user's true needs, identifying real-world contexts, investigating resources, creating headlines, and extracting valuable terms. This should help because it allows me to systematically unpack the query, identify key concepts, and uncover related terms that can enhance the search.\n\nFollowing the technique, I first assess the query to understand what the user is truly seeking. Beneath the surface, the user wants to grasp the ethical implications, health consequences, and competitive aspects of performance-enhancing drugs in sports. This involves identifying assumptions, such as the belief that performance-enhancing drugs are inherently unfair, and knowledge gaps, like the lack of understanding about the latest technological advancements in drug testing.\n\nNext, I consider real-world contexts where this query is relevant, including professional sports leagues, educational settings like sports medicine programs, personal situations such as athletes facing the decision to use performance-enhancing drugs, and specialized communities like anti-doping agencies. Each context offers a unique perspective on the issue, from the practical implications of drug use to the ethical debates surrounding fair play and competitive advantage.\n\nI then investigate resources, including notable experts in sports ethics and medicine, established methodologies like the World Anti-Doping Code, essential terminology such as \"therapeutic use exemptions,\" and organizations like the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). These resources provide a foundation for understanding the complex issues at play and the various stakeholders involved.\n\nCreating headlines that could introduce articles addressing the query from multiple angles helps to further refine the search terms. For example, \"The Ethics of Enhancing: Should Performance-Enhancing Drugs Be Allowed in Sports?\" or \"Beyond the Doping Scandals: The Future of Fair Play in Professional Sports.\" These headlines cover different aspects of the query, from beginner-oriented explanations to expert-level deep dives into the ethical and health-related implications.\n\nExtracting specific terms from these headlines, such as \"performance-enhancing drugs,\" \"sports ethics,\" \"fair play,\" \"health risks,\" \"anti-doping regulations,\" and \"therapeutic use exemptions,\" provides a set of high-value search terms that capture the essence of the user's query. These terms can be combined with the original query intent to create an augmented query that better reflects the user's information needs.\n\nThrough this process of applying the Query Expansion Through Journalistic Investigation technique and exploring related threads, I believe these terms would be most effective for enhancing the search: performance-enhancing drugs, ethics, fair play, health risks, anti-doping regulations, therapeutic use exemptions, sports medicine, and competitive advantage. They capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, including the ethical debates, health consequences, and competitive implications of performance-enhancing drugs in sports.",
