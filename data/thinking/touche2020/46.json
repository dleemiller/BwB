  "thought_process": "As I reflect on the query \"Should net neutrality be restored?\" and delve into the structured data provided, my initial thoughts revolve around the implications and arguments surrounding net neutrality. The query itself seems straightforward, yet it encompasses a complex debate about internet governance, the role of Internet Service Providers (ISPs), and the potential consequences of either restoring or repealing net neutrality. This makes me think of the various stakeholders involved, including internet users, businesses, and regulatory bodies, and how each group might have differing opinions on the matter.\n\nTransitioning to a more structured approach, I decide to apply the \"Query Expansion Through Journalistic Investigation\" technique. This involves treating the query as if I were a journalist tasked with writing a comprehensive story on the subject. The first step in this process is query assessment, where I analyze what the user is truly seeking. Beneath the surface, the user seems to be looking for an understanding of the arguments for and against net neutrality, the potential consequences of both restoring and repealing it, and how it impacts various groups.\n\nNext, I consider real-world contexts where this query is relevant. This includes professional contexts such as technology and legal industries, educational settings where net neutrality is discussed in terms of its impact on access to information, personal situations where individuals are concerned about their internet access and privacy, and specialized communities like tech enthusiasts and digital rights advocates.\n\nMoving on to resource investigation, I identify notable experts in the field of internet governance and digital rights, such as Timothy Wu and Lawrence Lessig, and their key contributions to the net neutrality debate. Essential terminology includes \"data prioritization,\" \"internet governance,\" and \"digital economy.\" Organizations like the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) are also crucial in this context.\n\nCreating diverse headlines to address the query from multiple angles helps to further expand the query. Examples include \"The Future of Internet Governance: Why Net Neutrality Matters,\" \"Net Neutrality Repeal: What It Means for Small Businesses and Innovators,\" and \"The Ethics of Data Prioritization: Balancing ISP Interests with User Rights.\" These headlines not only provide a framework for understanding the query but also help in extracting specific, high-value search terms related to net neutrality.\n\nExtracting terms from these headlines and the overall investigation process yields a list of keywords that can be used to augment the original query. These include \"net neutrality,\" \"internet access,\" \"data prioritization,\" \"ISP,\" \"digital economy,\" \"innovation,\" and \"internet governance.\" Combining the original query intent with these new terms results in an augmented query that can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the topic.\n\nThrough this process of applying the journalistic investigation technique and exploring related real-world terms and concepts, I believe the augmented query \"impact of net neutrality on internet access, data prioritization, and the digital economy\" effectively captures the essence of what the user is seeking. This expanded query incorporates both the explicit and implicit aspects of the original query, enhancing the potential for finding relevant and insightful information on the topic.",
