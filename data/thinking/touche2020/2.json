  "reasoning": "The query addresses the safety concerns regarding vaping. The current results are limited by biased opinions and lack of long-term research. Therefore, the focus will be to expand the search with terms related to the long-term health effects, specific chemicals involved in vaping, and alternative perspectives, such as studies on respiratory illnesses and cardiovascular impacts. I will identify and avoid overly general terms that might dilute the search. Then, I will broaden the search by adding terms that target specific health outcomes. I will select the most promising of these broader terms and delve deeper.",

  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"Is vaping with e-cigarettes safe?\", this makes me think of the broader implications of vaping on health, though the user might actually be trying to understand the immediate risks versus the long-term effects. Initially, my mind wanders to the various components of e-cigarettes, such as nicotine, flavorings, and the devices themselves, and how these might affect different aspects of health. However, to systematically approach this query expansion, I'll use a structured technique that involves identifying the primary objectives and gaps in the original query, recognizing ineffective terms, expanding the breadth of the search with more specific and diverse terms, and then delving deeper into one of these areas for more targeted results.\n\nThe original query seems to lack specificity regarding what \"safe\" entails, whether it's about the devices, the e-liquids, or the act of vaping itself. This makes me realize the need to focus on long-term health effects, specific chemicals, and alternative perspectives like respiratory and cardiovascular impacts. Terms like \"safe\", \"is\", and \"with\" are too broad and don't add much value to the search, so they should be avoided.\n\nTo expand the breadth of the search, terms like \"popcorn lung\", \"bronchiolitis obliterans\", \"acute lung injury\", \"myocardial infarction\", \"flavoring chemicals\", \"nicotine addiction\", \"propylene glycol\", \"vegetable glycerin\", \"secondhand vapor\", \"youth vaping\", \"gateway drug\", and \"smoking cessation\" come to mind. These terms start to paint a more detailed picture of the potential health implications and related issues surrounding vaping.\n\nHowever, to really drill down and find meaningful information, I need to choose one of these areas and go deeper. The topic of \"youth vaping\" stands out because it touches on several critical issues, including nicotine addiction, the impact on adolescent brains, and the potential for vaping to serve as a gateway to other substances. This leads me to consider terms like \"teen vaping trends\", \"e-cigarette marketing to teens\", \"youth nicotine dependence\", \"long-term effects of vaping on adolescent brains\", and \"vaping prevention programs\". These terms not only provide a clearer direction for the search but also start to uncover the complexities of vaping's impact on youth.\n\nAs I apply the expansion technique, I'm also considering synonyms, conceptual expansions, and domain-specific terminology to ensure the search terms are novel and relevant. For instance, looking into \"flavoring chemicals\" could involve exploring specific compounds like diacetyl, which is linked to \"popcorn lung\", or examining the role of \"nicotine addiction\" in the context of \"youth vaping trends\".\n\nThe process of expanding the query involves a constant back-and-forth between structured technique and natural intuition. While the technique provides a systematic approach to identifying relevant terms, my natural thought process is what connects these terms to the broader context of vaping safety. It's through this blend of structure and intuition that I start to see how terms like \"vaping prevention programs\" and \"secondhand vapor\" can be just as relevant to understanding the safety of vaping as terms directly related to health effects.\n\nThrough this process of applying the expansion technique and exploring related threads, I believe the terms that would be most effective for a search query are those that capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking. The final augmented query should reflect a deep dive into specific areas like youth vaping, while also considering the broader health and social implications of vaping. This approach ensures that the search results will be targeted, diverse, and relevant to the original query, providing a comprehensive understanding of the safety concerns surrounding e-cigarettes.",
