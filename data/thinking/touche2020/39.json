  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"Should the federal minimum wage be increased?\"... this makes me think of the broader economic implications and the debates surrounding wage policies. Though the user might actually be trying to find information on the current state of minimum wage laws, the effects on employment, or perhaps arguments for and against increasing it. Hmm, not sure yet, but I have a feeling that exploring related concepts and arguments will be key to expanding this query effectively.\n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here... Let me approach this using the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal technique, which involves constructing a graph with core concepts, identifying first and second-order connections, and then selecting promising expansion paths. This should help because it allows me to visually map out the relationships between different concepts and identify high-value terms that are semantically relevant to the original query.\n\nFollowing the technique, I start with query analysis, identifying core concepts like \"federal minimum wage,\" \"increase,\" and implicit assumptions such as the impact on employment and poverty. The search intent seems informational, aiming to explore the pros and cons of the policy proposal.\n\nNext, I construct the conceptual graph, starting with core nodes like \"federal minimum wage\" and \"increase.\" First-order connections include concepts like \"poverty,\" \"employment,\" and \"inflation,\" which are directly related to the potential effects of increasing the minimum wage. Second-order connections bring in related concepts one step removed, such as \"living wage,\" \"income inequality,\" and \"cost of living,\" which are relevant to understanding the broader economic and social implications.\n\nFor expansion path selection, I identify promising directions such as synonymous terms (e.g., \"wage hike\"), hierarchical terms (e.g., \"state minimum wage\"), compositional terms (e.g., \"tipped minimum wage\"), and contextual terms (e.g., \"small business\" impacts). Domain-specific terminology like \"earned income tax credit\" also seems relevant.\n\nApplying the technique's steps systematically, I extract high-value terms for each expansion path and filter them based on relevance, distinctiveness, specificity, and searchability. This process leads me to terms like \"living wage,\" \"income inequality,\" \"poverty threshold,\" and \"job creation,\" which not only are closely related to the original query but also offer valuable alternative pathways for document retrieval.\n\nAs I balance the structured approach with natural thought patterns, I find myself occasionally reconsidering the importance of certain terms or exploring tangents that might yield unexpected insights. For instance, thinking about \"tipped minimum wage\" leads me to consider the specific challenges faced by industries with a high proportion of tipped workers, which in turn highlights the need to include terms related to employment sectors and affected groups.\n\nThrough this process of applying the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal technique and exploring related threads, I believe the terms identified for the augmented query effectively capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking. The final expanded query, \"federal minimum wage\" +increase +( \"living wage\" OR \"income inequality\" OR \"poverty threshold\" OR \"job creation\" OR \"wage stagnation\" OR \"cost of living\" OR \"purchasing power\" OR \"state minimum wage\" OR \"local minimum wage\" OR \"tipped minimum wage\") -decrease, should improve the retrieval of relevant documents by incorporating a range of semantically relevant terms that reflect the complexity of the topic.",
