  "thought_process": "As I delve into the query \"sirtuins,\" my initial impression is that this is a complex topic with a rich history, spanning from its discovery in yeast to its current implications in human health and diseases. The user might be looking for a broad overview, but I suspect there's a need to uncover the depth of information available, from its historical context to the current research landscape and future trends. This makes me think of employing a structured approach to ensure coverage of all facets of sirtuin research.\n\nLet me approach this using the Temporal Evolution Analysis technique, which involves analyzing the topic's development over time to discover a wide range of temporally diverse terminology. This should help because it will allow us to capture not just the current understanding but also the historical foundations and future directions of sirtuin research.\n\nStarting with the historical foundation, I note the discovery of Silent Information Regulator 2 (Sir2) in yeast, the identification of its NAD+ dependence, and its link to lifespan extension in model organisms. These foundational concepts are crucial as they laid the groundwork for subsequent research. The technique suggests tracing the origins and early development, which leads me to consider terms like \"Sir2,\" \"NAD+ dependent deacetylase,\" and \"chromatin silencing.\"\n\nMoving on to the developmental milestones, I see the identification of mammalian sirtuins (SIRT1-7), the demonstration of deacetylation activity, and the link to calorie restriction and aging. These milestones are pivotal as they mark significant steps in understanding sirtuins' role in metabolism and aging. Applying the Temporal Evolution Analysis, I should identify breakthrough moments and how they changed terminology or approaches, leading to terms like \"SIRT1,\" \"resveratrol,\" and \"STACs\" (sirtuin-activating compounds).\n\nThe current landscape of sirtuin research is vast, with investigations into sirtuin roles in age-related diseases, their regulation, and their potential as therapeutic targets. The technique advises assessing the contemporary state and identifying current best practices, which points towards terms like \"age-related diseases,\" \"epigenetics,\" and \"longevity.\" It's also crucial to understand the isoform-specific functions and the involvement of sirtuins in various diseases, including cancer, neurodegeneration, and metabolic disorders.\n\nAs I project into the emerging trends, I see sirtuins being explored in the context of personalized medicine, epigenetic regulation, stem cell aging, and even their interaction with the microbiome. The technique suggests identifying new terminology gaining acceptance, such as \"sirtuins and personalized medicine,\" \"sirtuins in epigenetic regulation,\" and \"sirtuins and the microbiome.\" This step of the technique is revealing the dynamic nature of sirtuin research and its expanding scope.\n\nThrough this process, I've noticed that while applying the Temporal Evolution Analysis systematically, my natural thought patterns have also played a significant role. I've had moments of reconsideration, like when realizing the importance of including all sirtuin isoforms (SIRT1-7) in the query, and intuitive connections, such as linking sirtuins' role in aging to their potential in treating age-related diseases. There have been brief tangents, like pondering the implications of sirtuins in spaceflight and extreme environments, which, although not directly related to the core query, highlight the vast potential of sirtuin research.\n\nSynthesizing all the insights, I believe the Temporal Evolution Analysis has been instrumental in uncovering a comprehensive set of terms that capture the historical, current, and future aspects of sirtuin research. By balancing this structured technique with my natural thought processes, I've been able to craft an augmented query that should provide a thorough overview of sirtuins: \"sirtuins history AND sirtuins function AND sirtuins isoforms SIRT1 SIRT2 SIRT3 SIRT4 SIRT5 SIRT6 SIRT7 AND sirtuins aging AND sirtuins clinical trials AND sirtuins future research.\" This query incorporates terms from each temporal phase, ensuring that the search results will span the breadth of sirtuin research, from its origins to its future directions.",
