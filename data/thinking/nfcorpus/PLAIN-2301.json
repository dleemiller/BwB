  "reasoning": "The original query \"uterine health\" is too broad.  It's understandable why searches focusing on breast cancer risk factors dominate the results, as that's a well-researched area related to hormonal conditions and women's health. To broaden the scope and capture a more comprehensive understanding of uterine health, we need to:\n\n1. **Clarify Goals:**  Determine the specific aspects of uterine health the user is interested in (e.g., menstruation, fibroids, infertility).\n2. **Identify Ineffective Terms:** \"Uterine health\" is very general and may lead to overly broad results. \n3. **Expand Breadth:** Explore related concepts like gynecology, reproductive health, pelvic floor, and menstrual cycle disorders.\n4. **Deepen Understanding:** Focus on one specific area within breadth expansion and delve deeper into its subtopics.",

  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query \"uterine health,\" this makes me think of a broad range of women's health issues, though the user might actually be trying to understand something more specific, like the causes of uterine fibroids or the impact of hormonal imbalances on menstrual cycles. The existing reasoning provided has already broken down the query into specific goals, identified ineffective terms, expanded the breadth of related concepts, and delved deeper into specific areas like menstrual cycle disorders. \n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here, but to approach this systematically, I'll use the expansion technique provided, which involves being specific and diverse, applying varied augmentation techniques such as synonym replacement, conceptual expansion, contextual expansion, and domain-specific terminology. This should help because it ensures the augmented query captures a wide range of relevant documents without overlapping too much with the original terms.\n\nFollowing the expansion technique approach, I should first elucidate the goals and gaps in the original query. The primary objectives seem to be understanding causes of irregular menstruation, exploring treatment options for uterine fibroids, and learning about the impact of hormonal changes on uterine health. The gaps include the broadness of the term \"uterine health\" and the lack of specificity in the areas of interest.\n\nNext, I identify ineffective terms, which include \"uterine health\" due to its generality. The breadth expansion has already been done, listing terms like gynecology, reproductive health, menstrual cycle disorders, pelvic floor, hormonal imbalances, endometriosis, and infertility. For depth expansion, the choice of menstrual cycle disorders as a starting point is insightful, leading to subtopics like dysmenorrhea, amenorrhea, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and premenstrual syndrome (PMS).\n\nApplying the technique systematically, I see that the augmented query provided, 'gynecology menstrual cycle disorders dysmenorrhea amenorrhea PCOS PMS hormonal imbalances,' effectively captures the breadth and depth of the user's potential interests without using logical operators, ensuring uniqueness, diversity, relevance, and precision. This process has helped to unveil a more nuanced understanding of what the user might be seeking, moving from a very general query to a specific set of terms that can yield more targeted and useful results.\n\nThrough this process of applying the expansion technique and exploring related threads, I believe the terms in the augmented query are effective for capturing the complexities of uterine health beyond the initial broad query. They represent a balance between structured approach and natural cognitive patterns, enhancing the search query with specificity and relevance.",
