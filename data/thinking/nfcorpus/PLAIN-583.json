  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"antinutrients,\" this makes me think of various substances that can interfere with nutrient absorption in the body. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the specific types of antinutrients, their effects, and possibly how to mitigate these effects, the term itself is quite broad. My initial impression is that we need to drill down into specific examples of antinutrients and explore their implications on health and nutrition.\n\nTransitioning to a more structured approach, I'll be using the technique of query expansion, which involves identifying the primary objectives of the query, pinpointing gaps in the information sought, and then systematically expanding the query through breadth and depth expansions. This technique should help because it allows us to move from a general query to a more specific and nuanced set of search terms that can capture the complexity of the user's information needs.\n\nStarting with the breadth expansion, the goal is to identify terms that are increasingly distant from the original query but still relevant. Terms like \"phytates,\" \"lectins,\" \"tannins,\" \"oxalates,\" and \"enzyme inhibitors\" come to mind, as they are all types of antinutrients. Additionally, concepts such as \"nutrient bioavailability\" and \"mineral absorption\" are crucial, as they relate to the effects of antinutrients on the body.\n\nNow, applying the depth expansion technique, I choose to focus on \"phytates\" as a key term. Drilling deeper, we get into specifics like \"phytic acid,\" which is a major component of phytates found in cereals and legumes. The process of \"soaking\" and \"fermentation\" becomes relevant here, as these are methods used to reduce phytate content in foods, thereby enhancing mineral absorption. This leads to further exploration of how these methods impact the bioavailability of minerals like iron and zinc, which are essential nutrients.\n\nI notice that while applying the technique, my intuition also plays a role. For instance, recognizing that \"phytic acid\" is not just a term but a specific compound within the broader category of antinutrients helps in narrowing down the search. Similarly, understanding the dietary sources and the effects of antinutrients on mineral absorption intuitively guides the expansion towards more relevant and specific terms.\n\nThrough this process, I also consider the ineffective terms that should be avoided, such as the original term \"antinutrients\" itself, as it's too broad and doesn't add specificity to the search. The goal is to end up with a set of terms that are not only diverse and specific but also ensure that the search results will be novel and non-overlapping with what a simple search for \"antinutrients\" might yield.\n\nIn synthesizing the thought process, it becomes clear that applying the query expansion technique, coupled with intuitive insights and a deep understanding of the subject matter, leads to a more refined and effective search query. The expanded terms such as \"phytic acid,\" \"cereals,\" \"legumes,\" \"soaking,\" \"fermentation,\" \"iron absorption,\" and \"zinc absorption\" capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, providing a comprehensive framework for exploring the complex topic of antinutrients.",
