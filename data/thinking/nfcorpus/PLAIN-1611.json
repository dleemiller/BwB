  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"mesquite,\" my initial impression is that this could be related to the plant, the wood, or even culinary practices, given its use in smoking meats. However, the user might actually be trying to identify a mesquite tree, understand its properties, or find the best type for smoking recipes. This ambiguity suggests the need for a structured approach to expand the query effectively.\n\nLet me approach this using the Query Expansion via User Intent and Journey Mapping technique, which involves understanding how different users with varying levels of expertise and goals would search for information about mesquite throughout their learning journey. This technique should help because it considers the diverse contexts and vocabulary users might employ at different stages of their information search.\n\nFirst, I create user personas: a novice gardener looking to plant a mesquite tree, a DIY woodworker interested in the properties of mesquite wood, an arborist seeking advanced cultivation techniques, and a culinary chef wanting the best mesquite for smoking recipes. Each persona has a unique set of initial search terms, follow-up searches, and a distinct vocabulary based on their expertise level and context.\n\nFor the novice gardener, initial searches might include \"what is a mesquite tree\" or \"how to grow mesquite,\" while the DIY woodworker might search for \"uses for mesquite wood\" or \"mesquite wood properties.\" The arborist could be looking for \"types of mesquite trees\" or \"mesquite tree care,\" and the chef might search for \"best mesquite for smoking\" or \"mesquite recipes.\"\n\nAs I map the information journey for these personas, I see a progression from basic questions like \"what is a mesquite tree\" to more advanced queries such as \"mesquite wood for furniture\" or \"mesquite culinary applications.\" The vocabulary shifts from general terms to more specific ones, reflecting an increase in knowledge and understanding.\n\nThe technique also involves identifying specific scenarios where these users need information, such as identifying a mesquite tree in the wild, choosing the right mesquite wood for a project, or preparing traditional mesquite recipes. These scenarios help in extracting high-value terms that reflect the users' intent and actual search behaviors.\n\nApplying this technique, I start to see a pattern where certain terms are more relevant at different stages of the user's journey. For instance, \"mesquite identification\" and \"mesquite properties\" are crucial for beginners, while \"mesquite uses\" and \"grow mesquite tree\" become more relevant as users progress. Advanced users might focus on \"mesquite wood types,\" \"mesquite cooking,\" or \"smoking mesquite.\"\n\nOccasionally, I reconsider my approach to ensure I'm covering all personas and scenarios adequately. For example, I realize the importance of regional specificity for growing mesquite trees, leading me to include terms like \"growing mesquite trees in [region].\" This step back to reassess helps in capturing a broader range of potential searches.\n\nIntuitively, I also connect the dots between different aspects of mesquite, such as its use in smoking and its wood properties, recognizing that users might not always search in a linear or predictable manner. This intuition complements the structured technique by allowing for the inclusion of terms that might not be immediately apparent through persona creation and journey mapping alone.\n\nThrough this process of applying the Query Expansion via User Intent and Journey Mapping technique and exploring related threads, I believe the terms that would be most effective for expanding the query \"mesquite\" include \"mesquite tree identification,\" \"best mesquite for smoking recipes,\" \"growing mesquite trees in [region],\" and \"properties of mesquite wood for construction.\" These terms capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what users with different backgrounds and intents might be seeking when they search for \"mesquite.\"",
