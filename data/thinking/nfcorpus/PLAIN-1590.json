  "thought_process": "As I delve into the query \"medical ethics,\" my initial thoughts revolve around the principles that guide healthcare professionals and researchers. The terms \"autonomy,\" \"beneficence,\" \"non-maleficence,\" and \"justice\" immediately come to mind, forming the foundation of medical ethics. However, I realize that the user might be seeking more than just these core principles; they could be interested in the broader applications and nuances of medical ethics.\n\nTo systematically expand this query, I'll employ the Conceptual Territory Mapping technique. This approach involves creating a detailed map of the knowledge landscape surrounding medical ethics. I start by identifying the central coordinates of the query, which are the core principles and their practical applications. The cardinal directions for this map include the contrast between theoretical frameworks and practical applications, as well as the distinction between clinical ethics and research ethics.\n\nAs I explore the boundaries of the query's immediate territory, I notice neighboring domains such as law, philosophy, religion, and public health. These areas are crucial because they influence and are influenced by medical ethics. For instance, legal precedents like the Nuremberg Code and the Belmont Report have significantly shaped the ethical standards in medical research. Meanwhile, philosophical and religious perspectives inform individual and collective moral compasses in healthcare decisions.\n\nThe next step in the Conceptual Territory Mapping process is landmark identification. Key landmarks in the territory of medical ethics include foundational documents like the Hippocratic Oath, the Declaration of Helsinki, and professional codes of conduct from organizations such as the American Medical Association (AMA). These landmarks provide a framework for ethical decision-making in healthcare and research.\n\nProceeding to detail mapping, I fill in specialized features within each region of the map. This involves labeling precise, domain-specific terminology and noting historical sites and emerging developments. For example, within the region of clinical ethics, terms like \"informed consent,\" \"confidentiality,\" and \"end-of-life care\" are paramount. In research ethics, concepts such as \"resource allocation,\" \"research ethics,\" and \"conflicts of interest\" are critical.\n\nAs I navigate the conceptual territory, occasional tangents and reconsiderations arise. For instance, the mention of \"resource allocation\" leads me to think about healthcare access and rationing, which in turn connects to broader societal issues like economic inequality and policy-making. These tangents, while initially seeming off-topic, actually enrich the map by highlighting interconnectedness across different domains.\n\nUpon completing the detail mapping phase, I compile a cartographic legend\u2014a lexicon of the most important terms extracted from the map. This legend classifies terms by region and significance, selecting those that would most facilitate navigation of the medical ethics knowledge landscape. The terms that emerge as most valuable for navigation include \"autonomy,\" \"beneficence,\" \"non-maleficence,\" \"justice,\" \"informed consent,\" \"confidentiality,\" \"end-of-life care,\" \"resource allocation,\" \"research ethics,\" \"clinical ethics,\" \"reproductive ethics,\" and \"professionalism.\"\n\nThe synthesis of this process yields an augmented query that captures both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user might be seeking: \"medical ethics principles standards guidelines end-of-life care resource allocation research ethics informed consent confidentiality.\" This expanded query is designed to help a researcher or interested individual find relevant information across the broad spectrum of medical ethics, from core principles to practical applications and specialized topics.",
