  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"Zoloft\", this makes me think of antidepressants and psychiatric treatments. Though the user might actually be trying to find information on its effects, uses, or comparisons with other medications, the query itself is quite specific. I'm seeing several possibilities here, but I need a structured approach to ensure I'm covering all relevant aspects. Let me approach this using Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal, which involves analyzing the query, constructing a conceptual graph, selecting expansion paths, extracting and filtering terms, and finally, formulating an augmented query. This should help because it systematically explores the semantic space around \"Zoloft\", ensuring that we capture both explicit and implicit aspects of the user's search intent.\n\nFollowing the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal approach, I should first identify core concepts and entities in the original query. Here, \"Zoloft\" is the central concept, which is a medication, specifically an antidepressant. The search intent seems informational, aiming to gather knowledge about Zoloft. There are implicit assumptions about the user seeking detailed medical or research information, possibly including its effects, side effects, and comparisons with other antidepressants.\n\nNow, constructing the conceptual graph: \n- Core nodes include \"Zoloft\", \"antidepressant\", and \"medication\".\n- First-order connections involve properties like \"uses\", \"effects\", \"side effects\", and relationships such as \"comparisons to other antidepressants\".\n- Second-order connections might include related concepts like \"depression treatment\", \"anxiety medication\", and \"pharmacology\".\n- Domain contexts include \"psychiatry\", \"psychology\", and \"medical research\".\n\nFor expansion path selection, I identify the following promising directions:\n- Synonymous terms: \"sertraline\" (the generic name for Zoloft), \"SSRI\" (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, the class of drugs Zoloft belongs to).\n- Hierarchical terms: Broader concepts like \"psychiatric treatment\" or narrower ones like \"dosage forms of Zoloft\".\n- Compositional terms: \"active ingredients\", \"mechanism of action\".\n- Contextual terms: \"treatment-resistant depression\", \"anxiety disorders\".\n- Domain-specific terminology: \"neurotransmitter modulation\", \"clinical trial outcomes\".\n\nExtracting and filtering terms for each path:\n- Synonymous: \"sertraline\", \"SSRI\".\n- Hierarchical: \"antidepressant\", \"psychopharmacology\".\n- Compositional: \"serotonin\", \"reuptake inhibitor\".\n- Contextual: \"depression treatment\", \"anxiety medication\".\n- Domain-specific: \"pharmacokinetics\", \"efficacy studies\".\n\nAfter filtering for relevance, distinctiveness, specificity, and searchability, the expanded terms that stand out include \"sertraline\", \"SSRI\", \"antidepressant\", \"depression treatment\", \"anxiety medication\", \"psychopharmacology\", \"pharmacokinetics\", \"efficacy studies\", \"selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor\", and \"clinical trials\".\n\nThrough this process of applying Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal and exploring related threads, I believe these terms would be most effective for enhancing the original query. They capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, from specific medical information about Zoloft to broader contexts of its use and study.\n\nThe final augmented query could be: \"Zoloft, sertraline, antidepressant, SSRI, depression treatment, anxiety medication, psychopharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy studies, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, clinical trials\". This combination maintains the original search intent while providing alternative pathways for retrieval, enhancing the chances of finding relevant documents across various aspects of Zoloft.",
