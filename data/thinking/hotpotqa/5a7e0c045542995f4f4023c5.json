  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"Who was born first Doug Liman or Saul Metzstein?\", this makes me think of biographical comparisons, though the user might actually be trying to understand the timeline of their contributions to the film industry... hmm, not sure yet. The existing reasoning provided highlights the need for specificity in biographical details and the potential for name similarity issues. \n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here... Let me approach this using the expansion technique, which involves identifying gaps in the query, pinpointing ineffective terms, broadening the search scope, and then diving deeper into a specific area. This should help because it systematically covers all bases for a comprehensive search.\n\nFirst, examining the primary objectives and gaps, the query aims to compare birthdates and disambiguate between Doug Liman and Saul Metzstein. A significant gap is the lack of context about their professions or achievements, which could refine the search. \n\nFollowing the expansion technique, ineffective terms like \"born\" should be avoided as they are too broad. Instead, focusing on their roles in filmmaking, such as \"film directors\" or \"screenwriters,\" could yield more precise results. \n\nFor breadth expansion, considering terms like \"film directors,\" \"screenwriters,\" \"actors,\" and \"producers\" introduces new dimensions to the query, moving it beyond simple biographical details. The list of \"film directors\" and \"Independent film\" catches my attention as it directly relates to both individuals' careers.\n\nDelving deeper into \"Independent film\" as a chosen topic from breadth expansion, terms related to \"filmmaking history,\" \"American cinema,\" \"New Hollywood movement,\" and \"Independent film\" can provide a rich context. This step of the technique is revealing the importance of understanding the era and movement these directors were part of, which actually reminds me of the concept of \"art-house cinema\" that might also be relevant.\n\nI need to consider how these terms relate to the original query without using logical operators and ensuring uniqueness and diversity in the search terms. Applying the technique's focus on depth expansion leads me to terms like \"cinematography,\" \"screenplay,\" and \"film festivals,\" which could be crucial for understanding the contributions and timeline of Doug Liman and Saul Metzstein in the context of Independent film and American cinema.\n\nThrough this process of applying the expansion technique and exploring related threads, I believe terms such as \"Independent film,\" \"American cinema,\" \"New Hollywood,\" \"cinematography,\" and \"film festivals\" would be effective for a targeted search. They capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, focusing on the careers and contributions of Doug Liman and Saul Metzstein within the specific context of their work in the film industry.",
