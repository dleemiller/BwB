  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"Were Scott Derrickson and Ed Wood of the same nationality?\" it makes me think of biographical details and filmographies of both directors. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the cultural backgrounds or influences of these two figures, the primary goal seems to be determining their nationalities. \n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here, but to approach this systematically, I'll use a technique that involves expanding the query through both breadth and depth, focusing on targeted and diverse terms. This should help because it allows us to capture a wide range of relevant information without overlapping with the original terms or getting too generic.\n\nFirst, let's consider the gaps in the original query. We have information on Scott Derrickson's nationality but lack specific details about Ed Wood's. This indicates we need to delve deeper into Ed Wood's biographical details and possibly explore the cultural background of American filmmakers, given that Ed Wood is known to be an American filmmaker.\n\nAs I start applying the expansion technique, I identify terms that should be avoided because they're too broad or non-precise, such as \"Scott Beck,\" \"Bryan Woods,\" and film titles like \"Sweet Adeline\" or \"Temptation,\" which don't directly contribute to understanding the nationalities or biographies of the individuals in question.\n\nFor breadth expansion, I consider terms like \"Ed Wood biographical details,\" \"Scott Derrickson biography,\" \"Nationality information for Ed Wood,\" and \"Filmography of Scott Derrickson and Ed Wood.\" These terms start to build a foundation for understanding both directors but still need to be refined for specificity and relevance.\n\nDelving deeper into one of these topics, I choose \"Ed Wood biographical details\" for depth expansion. This leads me to consider \"Edward D. Wood Jr.,\" \"American filmmaker,\" \"Nationality of Edward D. Wood Jr.,\" and the \"Cultural background of Ed Wood.\" Exploring the historical context for American filmmakers in the 20th century could also provide valuable insights into Ed Wood's career and influences.\n\nAs I apply the technique, I notice that focusing on Ed Wood's full name, \"Edward D. Wood Jr.,\" and his role as an \"American filmmaker\" helps to clarify his nationality. The cultural background of American filmmakers during his time could offer additional context, linking his work and personal history to broader trends in American cinema.\n\nI just had a realization that connecting Ed Wood's influence on American cinema could also be relevant, as it speaks to his impact and the context in which he worked. Following the technique pointed me toward \"Edward D. Wood Jr.,\" but my instinct says we should also consider the broader implications of his and Scott Derrickson's work in American cinema.\n\nThrough this process of applying the expansion technique and exploring related threads, I've come to understand that the key to answering the original query lies in precisely identifying the nationalities of both directors and comparing them. The terms that emerge as most relevant are those related to the biographies, nationalities, and cultural backgrounds of Ed Wood and Scott Derrickson.\n\nThus, the augmented query that captures these insights effectively would be \"Biography of Edward D. Wood Jr., Nationality of Scott Derrickson and Ed Wood, Cultural background of American filmmakers.\" This query is novel, diverse, and targeted, avoiding ineffective terms and focusing on high-quality search terms that should yield non-overlapping and relevant results.",
