  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query about Steve Denton and Albert Costa, which asks when they began playing tennis, this makes me think of biographical details and early life stories of these individuals. Though the user might actually be trying to compare their beginnings or understand how early start ages affect their careers, hmm, not sure yet. The query seems straightforward but is missing specific details that could lead to more precise information.\n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here, but to approach this systematically, let me use the expansion technique that involves examining the query's objectives, identifying ineffective terms, and then expanding both the breadth and depth of the search terms. This technique should help because it allows for a structured exploration of related concepts while avoiding overly broad terms that don't contribute much to the search.\n\nFirst, understanding the primary objectives: the user wants to know the age at which Steve Denton and Albert Costa started playing tennis. The gap here is specific biographical information about these two individuals. Ineffective terms include \"tennis players,\" as it's too broad and doesn't specifically help in finding the ages at which they started playing.\n\nFor breadth expansion, I consider terms like \"childhood,\" \"early life,\" \"career beginnings,\" \"junior tennis,\" and \"sporting history.\" These terms expand the query by introducing concepts related to the early stages of a tennis player's life and career but still keep the focus on relevant biographical information.\n\nNow, for depth expansion, let's dive deeper into \"junior tennis.\" This could involve terms like \"youth sports,\" \"developmental stages,\" \"pediatric training,\" \"age-specific competitions,\" and \"talent identification programs.\" These terms not only expand the query but also provide a deeper insight into the world of junior tennis, potentially leading to more specific information about when players typically start their careers.\n\nFollowing the expansion technique, I should first identify the most relevant terms from the depth expansion that could add specificity to the query. Wait, that's not quite right for this query; we need terms that directly relate to biographical information and early career starts. Let me adjust my approach to focus on terms that are more directly related to the ages at which tennis players begin their careers.\n\nThis step of the technique is revealing insights into how players develop from a young age, which actually reminds me of the importance of \"youth sports\" and \"developmental stages\" in identifying future tennis stars. However, I need to consider how these terms can be used to find the specific ages at which Steve Denton and Albert Costa started playing.\n\nI just had a realization that connects to what we were exploring earlier; the key might lie in understanding the \"career beginnings\" of these players, which could involve looking into their participation in \"junior tennis\" competitions. Following the technique pointed me toward \"youth sports,\" but my instinct says we should also consider terms related to the transition from junior to professional tennis.\n\nApplying the specific aspect of the technique leads me to terms like \"early life\" and \"childhood,\" which might seem broad but could provide context for understanding when these players started their tennis journeys. I need to balance these broad terms with more specific ones like \"age-specific competitions\" to ensure the query yields results about the exact ages at which Steve Denton and Albert Costa began playing tennis.\n\nThrough this process of applying the expansion technique and exploring related threads, I believe the terms that would be most effective for the augmented query are those that capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, such as \"junior tennis,\" \"youth sports,\" \"career beginnings,\" and \"early life.\" However, to refine this further and ensure the terms are novel, diverse, and free from overlapping the original terms, I should focus on the depth expansion terms that provide a clear pathway to the desired information.\n\nThe final terms should logically emerge from both the technique and natural insights, leading to an augmented query that is both targeted and relevant. Considering all the steps and reflections, the terms \"childhood,\" \"early life,\" \"junior tennis\" are direct results of the breadth expansion, but to add depth and specificity, terms like \"youth sports\" and \"career beginnings\" are essential.\n\nThe final thought is to ensure the augmented query contains high-quality, unique search terms that are diverse and relevant, avoiding logical operators and ineffective words. With this in mind, the process leads to a refined understanding of how to approach the query expansion, resulting in an effective and targeted search query.",
