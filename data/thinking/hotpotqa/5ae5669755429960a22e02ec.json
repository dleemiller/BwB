  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"Which of the campaign that brought out the term Vichy Republican on social media was formally launched on June 16, 2015, at Trump Tower in New York City?\"... this makes me think of the 2016 presidential election and how social media played a significant role in it. Though the user might actually be trying to identify a specific campaign that popularized the term \"Vichy Republican,\" which seems to imply a certain political stance or movement. Hmm, not sure yet how to connect all these dots, but it seems like we're dealing with a very specific event and its impact on social media discourse.\n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here... Let me approach this using Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal, which involves analyzing the query, constructing a conceptual graph, and then traversing it to find relevant expansion terms. This should help because it allows us to systematically explore the semantic space around the original query, potentially uncovering terms that are highly relevant but not immediately obvious.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the core concepts and entities in the query. We have \"Vichy Republican,\" \"campaign,\" \"social media,\" \"Trump Tower,\" and \"June 16, 2015.\" The search intent seems informational, aiming to identify a specific campaign. There's an implicit assumption that the campaign is related to the Republican Party or conservative movement, given the context of Trump Tower and the term \"Vichy Republican.\"\n\nNow, let's construct the conceptual graph. The core nodes will be the entities and concepts directly mentioned in the query. First-order connections include the properties and relationships of these entities, such as the location of Trump Tower (New York City) and the nature of the campaign (political, involving social media). Second-order connections might involve related concepts like political polarization, conservative media, or specific figures associated with the Republican Party. Domain contexts include political science, social media studies, and possibly history, given the term \"Vichy\" which historically refers to the French government that collaborated with the Nazis during World War II.\n\nFor expansion path selection, I'm going to identify a few promising directions. One could be synonymous terms for \"Vichy Republican\" or \"campaign,\" though these might be challenging given the specificity of the term. Hierarchical terms could involve broader concepts like \"political movement\" or narrower ones like \"presidential campaign.\" Compositional terms might include parts of a campaign, such as \"rallies,\" \"advertisements,\" or \"social media strategies.\" Contextual terms could relate to the setting or scenario, such as \"election year,\" \"primary season,\" or \"general election.\" Lastly, domain-specific terminology might include terms like \"neo-conservative,\" \"tea party movement,\" or \"alt-right,\" depending on how \"Vichy Republican\" is interpreted within the context of American politics.\n\nAs I apply these expansion paths, I notice that terms like \"2016 presidential election,\" \"Donald Trump,\" \"Republican primary,\" and \"conservative movement\" start to emerge as relevant. There's also a connection to be made with the concept of \"establishment Republicans\" and how the term \"Vichy Republican\" might be used pejoratively to describe certain factions within the party. This step of the technique is revealing insights into how the query terms are interconnected and how they might be expanded to better capture the user's search intent.\n\nI just had a realization that connects to what we were exploring earlier... The term \"Vichy Republican\" is likely being used to describe a perceived betrayal or compromise by certain Republicans, akin to the historical Vichy government in France. This means our expansion terms should also consider aspects of political betrayal, compromise, or internal party conflicts. Following the technique pointed me toward the concept of political polarization, but my instinct says we should also consider the emotional and rhetorical aspects of how political terms are used on social media.\n\nThrough this process of applying Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal and exploring related threads, I believe the terms that would be most effective for expansion are those that capture the political, social, and rhetorical contexts of the o",
