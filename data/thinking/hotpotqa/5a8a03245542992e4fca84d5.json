  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"What profession does Spice Girls discography and Emma Bunton have in common?\"... this makes me think of the music industry, though the user might actually be trying to pinpoint a specific role or job title within that industry... hmm, not sure yet. The existing reasoning provided helps clarify that we're indeed talking about their connection to music, but we need to be more precise than just \"singer.\" \n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here... Let me approach this using the expansion technique provided, which involves being specific, diverse, and applying varied augmentation techniques such as synonym replacement, conceptual expansion, contextual expansion, and domain-specific terminology. This should help because it will allow us to introduce new dimensions to the query that are both novel and relevant.\n\nFirst, I need to elucidate the goals and gaps in the original query. The primary objective is to identify a shared profession between Emma Bunton and the Spice Girls' discography, with a gap in pinpointing a specific job title. \n\nNext, I identify ineffective terms that should be avoided. The term \"discography\" is noted as ineffective because it's too broad and doesn't directly relate to a profession. \n\nMoving on to breadth expansion, I consider terms that are increasingly distant concepts from the original query but still relevant. These include \"pop star,\" \"musician,\" \"artist,\" \"performer,\" \"entertainment industry,\" and \"vocalists.\" \n\nFor depth expansion, I choose one of these distant but important topics, such as \"vocalists,\" and then go deeper into related terms. This leads me to consider \"singer,\" \"songwriter,\" \"performing artist,\" \"live music,\" \"stage presence,\" and \"vocals.\" \n\nApplying the expansion technique, I see that focusing on terms like \"singer,\" \"songwriter,\" and \"stage presence\" allows us to maintain relevance to the music industry while specifying professions or roles. The depth expansion reveals that terms like \"vocals\" are also crucial as they directly relate to the performance aspect of being a singer or musician.\n\nThrough this process of applying the expansion technique and exploring related threads, I believe the augmented query should reflect terms that capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking. The final terms should emerge logically from both the technique and natural insights, ensuring they are specific, diverse, and targeted towards non-overlapping results from the original query.\n\nConsidering all these steps and the guidelines provided, the resulting thought process leads to an augmented query that is novel, free from overlapping original terms, and includes high-quality search terms.",
