  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"The actress who made her film debut in Friday Night Lights also starred in a 2014 French-American crime-thriller directed by whi?\", this makes me think of Amber Heard, though the user might actually be trying to find information about her film career or specific movies she has been in. Hmm, not sure yet, but it seems like the query is trying to pinpoint a particular film and its director. \n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here, but to approach this systematically, let me use the expansion technique provided, which involves specific guidelines for goal elucidation, ineffective term identification, breadth expansion, and depth expansion. This should help because it offers a structured way to break down the query and identify relevant terms that might not be immediately apparent.\n\nFirst, examining the primary objectives of the query, it seems the user wants to identify the actress and find the specific 2014 French-American crime thriller she starred in. The gaps in this query are the specifics about the film and possibly the director, given the incomplete question. \n\nThe term \"the\" appears to be an ineffective term as it's too broad and doesn't contribute much to narrowing down the search results. \n\nFor breadth expansion, we consider terms like \"crime fiction,\" \"French cinema,\" \"action thrillers,\" \"2014 films,\" and \"Amber Heard filmography.\" These terms introduce new dimensions to the query, expanding our search scope.\n\nHowever, to really dive deep and find more targeted information, we need to focus on one of these areas and expand it further. Let's consider \"French cinema\" and then delve into related genres or themes like \"international film,\" \"European crime dramas,\" \"Neo-noir,\" and \"psychological thriller.\" \n\nApplying the technique's steps systematically, I first look at the breadth expansion terms and then select one area, like \"French cinema,\" to expand further in depth. This leads me to consider \"international film\" and then more specifically, \"European crime dramas\" and \"Neo-noir.\" These genres and themes are closely related to the original query's focus on a crime thriller and provide a more nuanced approach to finding relevant information.\n\nAs I apply this technique, I also allow for natural cognitive elements to influence my thought process. For instance, recognizing that Amber Heard has starred in a variety of films, including those in the action and thriller genres, informs my selection of expansion terms. Intuitive connections, such as linking \"French cinema\" with \"Neo-noir,\" also play a role, as this genre is known for its stylish and dark thematic elements, often found in French film.\n\nOccasionally, I reconsider my approach, stepping back to reassess whether the terms I've selected are truly relevant and targeted. This reflection ensures that my final augmented query is both diverse and precise, capturing the essence of the original query while introducing new dimensions for search.\n\nThrough this process of applying the expansion technique and exploring related threads, I believe the terms \"Amber Heard French cinema psychological thriller crime fiction 2014 films\" would be most effective for capturing the user's intent. These terms balance the explicit mention of the actress and film genre with the implicit exploration of her filmography and relevant cinematic themes, providing a comprehensive approach to finding the desired information.",
