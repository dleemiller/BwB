  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"The Duke Steps Out stars an actress who was ranked tenth on a list of greatest female Hollywood stars in what year?\"... this makes me think of classic Hollywood and the actresses from that era. Though the user might actually be trying to find out the specific year Joan Crawford was ranked, which could involve looking into the history of rankings by the American Film Institute (AFI). Hmm, not sure yet how to connect the dots between the movie title, the actress's ranking, and the year in question.\n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here... Let me approach this using Query Expansion via Temporal Evolution Analysis, which involves analyzing how the query topic has evolved through time to discover temporally diverse terminology. This should help because it considers both the historical context and the evolution of terms over time, which seems crucial for pinpointing the exact year the ranking occurred.\n\nStarting with the historical foundation, I note that the American Film Institute (AFI) was established in 1967, and it has been a significant force in recognizing Hollywood talent. The AFI's early work and its impact on film criticism and awards ceremonies could provide a backdrop for understanding how rankings of Hollywood stars were perceived and valued over time. The Golden Age of Hollywood, spanning from the 1930s to the 1950s, is particularly relevant, as it was a time when many of the actresses who would later be ranked by the AFI were active.\n\nMoving on to developmental milestones, I see that the 1990s were significant for the AFI, with the release of its first list of 100 greatest American films. Later, in 2007, the AFI published its '100 Years...100 Stars' lists, both for male and female stars. This step of the technique is revealing how public opinion polls and internet influence have increasingly played a role in rankings, which actually reminds me of how the rise of digital platforms has changed the way we consume and interact with information about film and its stars.\n\nConsidering the current landscape, the AFI remains a respected authority, but there's also a greater emphasis on diversity and representation in film awards and recognition. This makes me think about how the criteria for ranking stars have evolved to include cultural impact and longevity, not just popularity at the time of their peak. I need to consider how these evolving criteria might have influenced the ranking of actresses like Joan Crawford over the years, but I'm also noticing this interesting pattern where the inclusion of diverse voices and perspectives in rankings is becoming more significant.\n\nFollowing the technique's approach to look at emerging trends, I project that there will be an even greater emphasis on international film talent and the use of data analytics to inform rankings and audience engagement. There's also the potential for online voting and community participation in rankings, which could further democratize the process. This step is leading me to think about how these future trends might reflect back on historical rankings, offering a new lens through which to view the achievements of actresses from earlier eras.\n\nApplying the specific aspect of the technique that involves compiling terminology from each time period leads me to discover terms like \"Classic Hollywood Era,\" \"New Hollywood,\" \"Blockbuster Era,\" and \"Digital Cinema Age.\" These terms not only provide a historical context but also help in understanding the evolving landscape of film and its stars. I just had a realization that connects to what we were exploring earlier - the importance of considering the temporal context in which rankings were made, as this can significantly influence how we interpret the information today.\n\nThrough this process of applying Temporal Evolution Analysis and exploring related threads, I believe the terms that would be most effective for expanding the query are those that capture the essence of Joan Crawford's career in the context of Hollywood's evolution, including terms related to her filmography, the era in which she was active, and the criteria used by the AFI for its rankings. This approach ensures that the expanded query considers both the structured evolution of the topic and the natural, intuitive connections that arise from understanding the broader context of Hollywood history.",
