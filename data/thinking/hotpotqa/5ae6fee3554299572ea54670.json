  "thought_process": "Looking at the query about the player who defeated Johnny Majors for the Heisman Trophy in 1956, this makes me think of historical sports figures and the significance of the Heisman Trophy in American football. Though the user might actually be trying to understand more about the era of football or the life of Paul Hornung, the central figure emerging from this query, my initial impression is that we're dealing with a very specific piece of sports trivia.\n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here, but let me approach this using Query Expansion via Conceptual Territory Mapping, which involves creating a detailed map of the concepts and ideas surrounding the topic. This should help because it will allow us to systematically explore the related concepts, identify key landmarks, and ultimately find the most relevant information.\n\nStarting with the central coordinates, Paul Hornung and the Heisman Trophy in 1956 are our focal points. The scale of exploration seems to be quite granular, focusing on a specific event and individual. As I establish the cardinal directions, I'm considering the practical aspect of who won the trophy and the theoretical aspect of what the trophy signifies in the context of college football history.\n\nMoving to boundary exploration, the query's immediate territory involves college football, the Heisman Trophy, and the year 1956. Neighboring domains include the NFL, given Paul Hornung's later career, and sports history, especially the 1950s era of American football. Notably, there's an overlap between college football and professional football, as many players transition from one to the other.\n\nIdentifying landmarks, we have Paul Hornung as a key figure, the University of Notre Dame as his alma mater, and the Heisman Trophy criteria as a significant concept for understanding why Hornung was chosen. The 1956 NFL Draft is also a landmark, as it would have been a pivotal event in Hornung's career following his collegiate success.\n\nIn detail mapping, we're looking at positions like fullback and quarterback, statistics such as touchdowns and yards gained, and the process of the NFL Draft. Draft position and the awards and honors received by Paul Hornung are also crucial details. This step involves filling in the specialized features within each region of our conceptual map, labeling them with precise terminology, and noting both historical sites and emerging developments.\n\nAs I create a cartographic legend or lexicon of the most important terms, I'm classifying them by region and significance. Terms like \"Heisman Trophy,\" \"Paul Hornung,\" \"1956,\" \"College Football History,\" and \"Notre Dame\" are central. Other significant terms might include \"Johnny Majors\" for context, \"University of Tennessee\" as Majors' alma mater, and \"NFL Draft\" as a subsequent career step for Hornung.\n\nThrough this process of applying Conceptual Territory Mapping and exploring related threads, I believe the most effective terms for navigating this knowledge landscape would indeed be those directly related to Paul Hornung, the Heisman Trophy, and the specific year in question. The birth year of Paul Hornung, his biography, and details about the Heisman Trophy winner in 1956 emerge as key areas of interest. This structured approach, balanced with natural thought patterns and intuitive connections, leads to a clearer understanding of what the user is seeking and how to find relevant information within the vast territory of sports history.",
