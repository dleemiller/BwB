  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"Are After Midnight Project and Aaroh both rock bands?\"... this makes me think of music genres and how they're classified. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the specific styles of these bands, or perhaps compare their sounds. Hmm, not sure yet, but it seems like we need to delve into the world of rock music and possibly explore other genres that these bands might be associated with.\n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here... Let me approach this using the Query Expansion Through Journalistic Investigation technique, which involves treating the query like a story that needs to be researched and expanded upon. This should help because it will allow us to consider various real-world contexts, expert insights, and related terminology that can enrich our understanding of the query.\n\nFirst, I'll assess the query to identify what the user is truly seeking. Beneath the surface, the user wants to confirm the genres of both bands and possibly understand their musical styles and any overlaps or differences. There's an assumption that both might be rock bands, but we need to verify this, especially for Aaroh, where information seems scarce.\n\nNext, I'll consider real-world scenarios where this query is relevant. This could include music festivals, concerts, album releases, and critical reviews. Professionals in the music industry, music educators, and fans of rock music would all have an interest in this query. Historically, the classification of rock music has evolved, with various sub-genres emerging, which could influence how we categorize the music of After Midnight Project and Aaroh.\n\nNow, let's investigate resources. Notable music critics, band interviews, and official discographies could provide insights into the genres and styles of these bands. Methodologies for analyzing music genres, such as lyrical analysis or musical composition techniques, could also be useful. Essential terminology might include specific sub-genres of rock music, musical instruments commonly used in rock, and recording techniques.\n\nCreating headlines for articles addressing this query from different angles can help extract valuable terms. For example:\n- \"Unlocking the Sound: A Deep Dive into After Midnight Project's Discography\"\n- \"Aaroh: The Evolution of a Band's Genre-Bending Style\"\n- \"Rock Music Through the Ages: How Sub-Genres Emerge and Influence\"\n- \"The Future of Rock: Emerging Bands and Their Unique Sounds\"\n- \"Comparing Apples and Oranges: After Midnight Project vs. Aaroh in the Rock Scene\"\n\nFrom these headlines, we can extract specific terms that represent precise concepts related to the query, such as \"discography,\" \"genre-bending,\" \"sub-genres,\" \"emerging bands,\" and \"unique sounds.\" These terms can help us craft an augmented query that captures the essence of what the user is seeking.\n\nFollowing the Query Expansion Through Journalistic Investigation approach, I should first identify the genres of both bands, then compare their musical styles, and finally, explore how they fit into the broader rock music scene. Wait, that's not quite right for this query. Let me adjust... we actually need to start by confirming the genre of Aaroh, as that's the missing piece of information. This step of the technique is revealing the importance of understanding the musical context in which both bands operate, which actually reminds me of the concept of musical influences and how bands evolve over time.\n\nI need to consider the next step in the technique, which involves looking into real-world contexts where the query is relevant, but I'm also noticing this interesting pattern where the emergence of new rock bands and their genres can significantly impact the music scene. Applying the specific aspect of the technique that involves resource investigation leads me to discover terms like \"alternative rock,\" \"indie rock,\" and \"progressive rock,\" which might be relevant to both bands.\n\nThrough this process of applying the Query Expansion Through Journalistic Investigation technique and exploring related threads, I believe the terms that would be most effective for expanding the query are those related to the genres of rock music, the process of genre classification, and the comparison of musical styles. Specifically, terms like \"rock music genres,\" \"musical style comparison,\" \"genre classification,\" and \"emerging rock bands\" capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking.\n\nThis thought process has not only helped in understanding the query better but has also shown how the Query Expansion Through Journalistic Investigation technique can be systematically applied to uncover valuable terms and concepts related to the query, ultimately leading to a more informed and effective search strategy.",
