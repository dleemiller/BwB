  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"What occupation do Chris Menges and Aram Avakian share?\" this makes me think of the film industry, as both names seem familiar in that context. Though the user might actually be trying to find a specific profession they have in common, I'm not sure yet what that could be. It's possible they're both directors, cinematographers, or perhaps they've worked together on projects in different capacities. I need to consider the various roles within the film industry and how these individuals might fit into them.\n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here, so let me approach this using the Conceptual Graph Traversal technique, which involves constructing a graph of related concepts and entities to find high-value expansion terms. This should help because it allows me to systematically explore the relationships between Chris Menges, Aram Avakian, and their potential occupations within the film industry.\n\nFirst, I'll identify the core concepts and entities. We have Chris Menges and Aram Avakian as the main individuals and their shared occupation as the objective. The search intent seems informational, aiming to discover what profession they have in common. There's an implicit assumption that both are involved in the film industry, given the context.\n\nNext, I'll build the conceptual graph. The core nodes will be Chris Menges, Aram Avakian, and \"occupation.\" First-order connections include their known roles or professions, and second-order connections could involve related concepts like film genres, collaborative projects, or awards they might have received. The domain context is clearly the film industry.\n\nFor expansion path selection, I'll consider synonymous terms (e.g., \"profession\" instead of \"occupation\"), hierarchical terms (broader concepts like \"career\" or narrower ones like \"specific role in film production\"), compositional terms (parts of their job, like \"camera operation\" for a cinematographer), contextual terms (settings or scenarios where they work, such as \"film sets\" or \"post-production\"), and domain-specific terminology (industry jargon or job titles specific to film).\n\nFollowing the Conceptual Graph Traversal approach, I should first identify promising directions. Synonymous terms could include \"profession,\" \"career,\" or \"role.\" Hierarchical terms might involve \"artist\" as a broader concept or \"cinematographer\" as a narrower one. Compositional terms could include \"directing,\" \"producing,\" or \"screenwriting\" as parts of their occupation. Contextual terms might involve \"Hollywood,\" \"film festivals,\" or \"award ceremonies.\" Domain-specific terminology could include \"DP\" (Director of Photography), \"gaffer,\" or \"film editor.\"\n\nAs I extract and filter terms, I'm looking for relevance, distinctiveness, specificity, and searchability. Terms like \"cinematographer,\" \"director,\" and \"film industry\" seem relevant and specific. \"Artist\" might be too broad, while \"DP\" could be a good domain-specific term. I also consider how these terms might appear in documents and their likelihood of leading to relevant information about Chris Menges and Aram Avakian's shared occupation.\n\nApplying this technique leads me to discover terms like \"cinematographer,\" \"film director,\" and \"producer.\" This realization connects to what we were exploring earlier regarding the film industry context and the potential roles these individuals might share. Following the technique pointed me toward these specific occupations, but my instinct also says we should consider broader terms like \"filmmaker\" or \"film professional\" to capture any overlap in their careers.\n\nThrough this process of applying Conceptual Graph Traversal and exploring related threads, I believe the most effective terms for expanding the query would include \"cinematographer,\" \"film director,\" \"producer,\" \"filmmaker,\" and \"film industry professional.\" These terms capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking regarding Chris Menges and Aram Avakian's shared occupation.\n\nThe original query was \"What occupation do Chris Menges and Aram Avakian share?\" and with the expansion technique, we can refine this to better capture the intended search results. Considering the core concepts, expansion paths, and filtered terms, the augmented query could be \"What occupations do Chris Menges and Aram Avakian share in the film industry, specifically considering roles like cinematographer, director, or producer?\"",
