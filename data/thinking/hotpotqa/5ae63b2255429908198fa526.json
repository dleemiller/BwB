  "thought_process": "As I delve into expanding the query about the college football game between Clemson and Oklahoma at Sun Life Stadium, my initial impressions lean towards the significance of this event in college football history. The user's query hints at a specific game where Clemson defeated the No. 4 Oklahoma Sooners, 37-17, but the date of the game is the primary focus. This makes me think of various ways users might search for such information, from general queries about the teams involved to more specific searches for the date and outcomes of the game.\n\nLet me approach this using the query expansion technique via user intent and journey mapping, which involves creating user personas, analyzing search vocabulary, mapping information journeys, identifying contextual scenarios, and extracting intent-based terms. This should help because it covers a broad spectrum of how different users might interact with the search query, from novice fans to expert analysts.\n\nStarting with user personas, I envision four main types: a novice sports fan looking for memorable games, an intermediate enthusiast seeking detailed game outcomes, an advanced analyst compiling historical data, and an expert historian researching the game's impact on college football history. Each persona has different goals, motivations, and levels of prior knowledge and vocabulary. For instance, a novice might start with a general query like \"Clemson vs Oklahoma game,\" while an expert might directly search for \"2015 Orange Bowl date and results.\"\n\nAs I analyze search vocabulary, it becomes clear that initial search terms will vary significantly based on the user's expertise level. Follow-up searches will also evolve, becoming more specific as users delve deeper into their query. There's a chance for misconceptions, especially regarding the date, given the number of high-profile games that might be confused with this one. \n\nMapping the information journey, I see users progressing from general awareness of college football bowl games to more detailed explorations of specific games like the 2015 Orange Bowl. Advanced users will seek statistical data and game analysis, while experts will look into the broader historical context and impact of the game.\n\nConsidering contextual scenarios, users might search during sports discussions, for fantasy football analysis, or while researching historical sports events. Each scenario influences the vocabulary and intent behind their search queries. For academic research, terms might include \"college football history\" and \"impact of the 2015 Orange Bowl,\" whereas for fantasy football, the focus might be on \"player performance statistics\" and \"game outcomes.\"\n\nThrough intent-based term extraction, high-value terms emerge that capture the essence of users' searches across different stages and contexts. Terms like \"Clemson vs Oklahoma score,\" \"Orange Bowl history,\" and \"Sun Life Stadium 2015 game info\" reflect the diversity of user intents and information needs.\n\nApplying this technique systematically, I adjust my approach as needed. For instance, recognizing that the game in question is the 2015 Orange Bowl, I realize the importance of including specific terms related to this event in the expanded query. This leads to considering not just the date but also detailed outcomes and statistics that would satisfy both novice and advanced users.\n\nAs I step back to reassess, it's evident that the expanded query needs to balance specificity with breadth to cater to all potential users. The final terms for the expanded query should logically emerge from both the systematic application of the technique and the natural insights gained from understanding user behaviors and intents.\n\nThrough this process of applying the query expansion technique and exploring related threads, I believe the terms that would be most effective for capturing the user's intent are those that combine specificity about the event (e.g., \"2015 Orange Bowl\") with the general information sought (e.g., \"date\" and \"detailed outcomes\"). Thus, the expanded query that best reflects the user's needs, considering various personas, journeys, and contexts, is: \"Find the exact date and detailed outcomes of the Clemson vs. Oklahoma game at Sun Life Stadium in the 2015 Orange Bowl, including statistics on how Clemson secured their victory.\"\n\nThis thought process demonstrates how experts balance structured techniques with natural cognitive patterns to expand a search query, ensuring it meets the diverse needs of various users.",
