  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"The Florida Atlantic Owls team represents a school classified by the Carnegie Foundation as what?\" this makes me think of university classifications and the different categories that the Carnegie Foundation uses. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the specific classification of Florida Atlantic University, I'm not sure yet what aspects of this classification are most relevant. The mention of the \"Florida Atlantic Owls team\" initially leads me to think about athletic programs, but given the context of the Carnegie Foundation, it's clear that the focus should be on educational and research aspects rather than sports.\n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here, but to approach this systematically, let me use the expansion technique provided, which involves enhancing the query through specific, diverse, and novel terms that introduce new dimensions without overlapping with the original terms. This technique should help because it encourages a deep dive into related concepts and terminology that might not be immediately apparent from the initial query.\n\nStarting with the task of goal elucidation and gaps, the primary objective is to identify Florida Atlantic University's Carnegie Classification, understanding what this classification entails, and how it reflects the university's standing in terms of research and education. A gap in the original approach seems to be the focus on athletic programs rather than academic and research aspects.\n\nNext, identifying ineffective terms, I notice that \"Florida Atlantic Owls,\" \"team,\" \"athletic,\" and \"programs\" are too broad or misleading in the context of seeking information on university classifications. These terms should be avoided in the expanded query to ensure focus on the academic and research dimensions.\n\nFor breadth expansion, considering terms like \"university rankings,\" \"higher education institutions,\" \"academic classification,\" \"Carnegie classifications,\" and \"research universities\" can provide a wider perspective on how universities are categorized and evaluated. However, to ensure the query remains specific and targeted, it's essential to drill down into more precise concepts related to the Carnegie Foundation's classifications.\n\nIn depth expansion, choosing \"Carnegie Foundation\" as a pivotal term, I can explore related concepts such as \"mission statement,\" \"doctoral programs,\" \"public/private institution,\" \"institutional research,\" and \"research activity levels.\" These terms offer a deeper insight into what factors contribute to a university's classification and how the Carnegie Foundation evaluates institutions.\n\nAs I apply this expansion technique, I start to see how the different aspects of university classification interconnect. For instance, understanding the Carnegie Foundation's mission statement can provide context on why certain universities are classified in specific ways. Similarly, looking into doctoral programs and research activity levels can give insight into the criteria used for classification.\n\nOne interesting connection that emerges is how the classification of a university as a research institution can impact its reputation and the opportunities it offers to students and faculty. This realization connects back to the initial goal of understanding Florida Atlantic University's classification, highlighting the importance of considering both the explicit criteria used by the Carnegie Foundation and the broader implications of these classifications.\n\nThrough this process of applying the expansion technique and exploring related threads, I believe the most effective terms for capturing the essence of the query would be those that reflect the academic, research, and institutional aspects of university classifications. Terms like \"Carnegie Foundation,\" \"doctoral programs,\" \"public institution,\" and \"research activity\" are not only specific and diverse but also directly relevant to understanding the classification of Florida Atlantic University.",
