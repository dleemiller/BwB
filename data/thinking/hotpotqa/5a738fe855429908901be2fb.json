  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"What film was written and directed by Joby Harold with music written by Samuel Sim?\"... this makes me think of a very specific film, but the user might actually be trying to find information about the collaborative work between Joby Harold and Samuel Sim, or perhaps details about the film's production or reception. Hmm, not sure yet...\n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here... Let me approach this using the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal technique, which involves analyzing the query, constructing a conceptual graph, selecting expansion paths, extracting and filtering terms, and finally, augmenting the query. This should help because it allows us to systematically uncover related terms and concepts that can improve the search results.\n\nFirst, I identify the core concepts and entities in the original query: \"film,\" \"Joby Harold,\" \"Samuel Sim,\" \"written,\" \"directed,\" and \"music.\" The search intent seems to be informational, as the user is seeking specific details about a film. There's an implicit assumption that the film exists and that Joby Harold and Samuel Sim are credited in the specified roles.\n\nNow, let's construct the conceptual graph. The core nodes will be \"Film,\" \"Joby Harold,\" \"Samuel Sim,\" with first-order connections including \"writer,\" \"director,\" and \"composer.\" Second-order connections might include \"screenwriter,\" \"filmmaker,\" and \"soundtrack.\" Domain contexts could involve the film industry, music composition, and directing.\n\nFor expansion path selection, I'll choose the following directions: synonymous terms (e.g., \"movie\" for \"film\"), hierarchical terms (e.g., \"cinema\" as a broader concept), compositional terms (e.g., \"score\" as a part of \"music\"), and contextual terms (e.g., \"production\" or \"release year\" as settings).\n\nAs I traverse the graph, I notice that terms like \"screenwriter\" and \"filmmaker\" could be useful, as they directly relate to Joby Harold's roles. Similarly, \"soundtrack\" and \"score\" are relevant to Samuel Sim's contribution. I also consider terms that might provide more context, such as \"genre\" or \"release year,\" although these aren't directly mentioned in the query.\n\nApplying the technique's steps systematically, I extract high-value terms from each expansion path. For synonymous terms, I have \"movie\" and \"cinema.\" For hierarchical terms, \"entertainment\" could be useful, but it's too broad, so I focus on \"film industry\" instead. Compositional terms give me \"soundtrack\" and \"score,\" and contextual terms offer \"production\" and \"release year.\"\n\nFiltering these terms for relevance, distinctiveness, specificity, and searchability, I prioritize \"screenwriter,\" \"filmmaker,\" \"soundtrack,\" \"score,\" and \"film industry.\" These terms maintain the original search intent while providing alternative pathways for retrieval.\n\nThrough this process of applying the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal technique and exploring related threads, I believe the following terms would be most effective for expanding the query: \"screenwriter,\" \"filmmaker,\" \"soundtrack,\" \"score,\" \"film industry.\" These capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, enhancing the likelihood of finding relevant information about the film written and directed by Joby Harold with music by Samuel Sim.",
