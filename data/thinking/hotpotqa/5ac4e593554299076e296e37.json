  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"OU812 was the second album to feature a vocalist that also played what instrument in 'Finish What Ya Started'?\", this makes me think of Sammy Hagar and his role in the band Van Halen. Though the user might actually be trying to find out what instrument Sammy Hagar played on that specific track, hmm, not sure yet... The original query seems somewhat vague, focusing on the album and the song rather than the musician's skills.\n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here... Let me approach this using the expansion technique, which involves identifying ineffective terms, performing breadth expansion, and then depth expansion. This should help because it allows us to systematically explore related concepts and pinpoint the most relevant information.\n\nFirst, let's identify the ineffective terms - these are broad or non-precise terms that don't add much value to the query. In this case, terms like \"vocalist\", \"album\", and \"song\" are quite general and could apply to many different contexts. We should avoid these terms in our expanded query.\n\nNext, we can perform breadth expansion by listing candidate terms that are increasingly distant from the original query. This could include terms like \"guitarist\", \"bassist\", \"drummer\", \"keyboardist\", and \"multi-instrumentalist\". These terms give us a wider range of possibilities to consider.\n\nNow, let's choose one of these terms and perform depth expansion. I'll choose \"guitarist\" because it's a plausible instrument for Sammy Hagar to play. Depth expansion involves listing terms that are increasingly specific and related to the chosen term. In this case, we could have terms like \"electric guitar\", \"lead guitar\", \"rhythm guitar\", and \"soloing techniques\". These terms help us drill down into the specifics of what we're looking for.\n\nFollowing the expansion technique, I should first identify the primary objectives of the query... which is to find the instrument played by Sammy Hagar on 'Finish What Ya Started'. Then, I should consider the ineffective terms and avoid them in my expanded query. This step is crucial because it helps us refine our search and avoid irrelevant results.\n\nAs I apply the technique, I'm noticing that the term \"guitarist\" is a good starting point. This leads me to think about the specific type of guitar playing involved in the song... which could be \"electric guitar\" or \"lead guitar\". I just had a realization that connects to what we were exploring earlier - the song \"Finish What Ya Started\" is known for its guitar work, so it's likely that Sammy Hagar played a significant role in that aspect of the song.\n\nThrough this process of applying the expansion technique and exploring related threads, I believe the most effective terms for the augmented query would be those that capture the specific instrument and the song. By focusing on these terms, we can create a query that is both targeted and diverse, yielding non-overlapping results from the original query.",
