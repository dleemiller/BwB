  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"A Swingin' Safari\" was a song written originally by German songwriter Bert Kaempfert but made popular by who? This makes me think of the era of big band and lounge music, though the user might actually be trying to find out more about the artists who were prominent in instrumental jazz during the 1960s. Hmm, not sure yet if it's directly about Billy Vaughn or other similar musicians. \n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here, so let me approach this using the expansion technique that involves systematically broadening the query terms to capture the essence of the user's search intent. This should help because it allows us to consider various dimensions of the query, from the specific to the more general, ensuring we don't miss relevant information.\n\nFirst, I need to clarify the goals of the query, which seem to be identifying the artist who popularized \"A Swingin' Safari\" and finding musicians known for instrumental jazz renditions. There are gaps in the original query, like not specifying the genre or era, which could lead to broad and non-precise results. \n\nUpon further consideration, terms like \"song\" and \"written\" seem too generic and might not be effective in narrowing down the search to the intended targets. Therefore, it's crucial to avoid these terms in the augmented query.\n\nFor breadth expansion, I'll consider terms that are increasingly distant from the original query but still relevant. This leads me to think about \"instrumental music,\" \"jazz standards,\" \"1960s popular music,\" \"big band,\" and \"lounge music.\" These terms start to paint a picture of the musical landscape of the time.\n\nHowever, I also need to dive deeper into one of these areas to ensure the augmented query captures specific and relevant information. Choosing \"instrumental jazz musicians\" as a starting point for depth expansion, I start to explore related terms like \"popular instrumental artists 1960s,\" \"Billy Vaughn era performers,\" and \"easy listening pioneers.\" This depth chain provides a clear path from the general to the specific, ensuring the query terms are both targeted and diverse.\n\nAs I apply the expansion technique, I notice that some terms, like \"easy listening,\" could complement the search by introducing a genre that's closely related to instrumental jazz. Similarly, focusing on the 1960s as a pivotal era for this type of music helps in narrowing down the search.\n\nThrough this process of applying the expansion technique and exploring related threads, I believe the terms that would be most effective for the augmented query are those that capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking. Therefore, combining terms like \"Billy Vaughn,\" \"instrumental jazz,\" \"1960s,\" and \"easy listening\" seems logical, as they reflect the structured approach to query expansion while also incorporating intuitive connections and insights gained during the process.\n\nThe final augmented query, \"Billy Vaughn instrumental jazz 1960s easy listening,\" reflects this synthesis of structured technique and natural thought patterns, aiming to provide a more targeted and relevant search outcome.",
