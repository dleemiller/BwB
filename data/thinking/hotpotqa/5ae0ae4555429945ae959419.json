  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"Jal Pari, which translated in another language refers to which legendary creature which are sometimes associated with perilous events such as floods, storms, shipwrecks, and drownings?\"... this makes me think of water spirits and mythical beings associated with the ocean and rivers. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the specific creature \"Jal Pari\" and its connections to water-related calamities, I notice that the current results lack specificity and fail to connect \"Jal\" (water) with the creature or offer insights into its folklore origins.\n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here... Let me approach this using the expansion technique, which involves applying synonym replacement, conceptual expansion, contextual expansion, and domain-specific terminology. This should help because it allows us to systematically explore related concepts and terms that might not be immediately apparent from the original query.\n\nStarting with goal elucidation and gaps, I identify the primary objectives as understanding \"Jal Pari\" in mythology, its symbolism, and connections to water disasters. The gaps include the lack of specificity in current results and the failure to connect \"Jal\" with the creature or its folklore origins. Ineffective terms that should be avoided include \"translated,\" \"another language,\" \"shipwrecks,\" and \"drownings,\" as they are too broad or non-precise.\n\nFor breadth expansion, I list candidate terms with increasingly distant concepts to the original query, such as \"water spirits,\" \"mythical beings,\" \"ocean deities,\" \"flood myths,\" and \"ancient folklore.\" These terms introduce new dimensions to the query and help us explore related concepts.\n\nFor depth expansion, I choose one distant but important topic from the breadth expansion, \"water spirits,\" and go increasingly deeper in the related terms. This leads me to \"Hindu mythology,\" \"Naga\" (serpent deity), \"sacred water bodies,\" and \"rivers as lifeblood.\" These terms provide a more targeted and specific exploration of the concept of \"Jal Pari\" and its associations with water-related calamities.\n\nAs I apply the expansion technique, I notice that the term \"Naga\" is particularly relevant, as it is a serpent deity in Hindu mythology associated with water and rivers. This reminds me of the concept of \"sacred water bodies\" and the importance of rivers in ancient folklore. I also consider the term \"flood myths\" and how it might be connected to the legend of \"Jal Pari.\"\n\nFollowing the technique's approach, I should first identify the key concepts and terms related to \"Jal Pari\" and then expand on those terms to include more specific and diverse concepts. This leads me to the augmented query: \"Jal Pari, Hindu mythology, Naga, sacred water, rivers.\" However, I realize that this query might still be too narrow, and I should consider additional terms that could provide more context and relevance.\n\nApplying the technique further, I consider the concept of \"ocean deities\" and how it might be related to \"Jal Pari.\" This leads me to the term \"Varuna,\" which is a Hindu god associated with the ocean and water. I also think about the term \"flood myths\" and how it might be connected to the legend of \"Jal Pari.\" This reminds me of the concept of \"deluge\" and the story of \"Manu\" in Hindu mythology.\n\nThrough this process of applying the expansion technique and exploring related threads, I believe the terms \"Jal Pari, Hindu mythology, Naga, sacred water, rivers, Varuna, deluge, Manu\" would be most effective for a search query. They capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking and provide a more targeted and specific exploration of the concept of \"Jal Pari\" and its associations with water-related calamities.",
