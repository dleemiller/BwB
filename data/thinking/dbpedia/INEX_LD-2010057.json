  "thought_process": "As I delve into expanding the search query \"Einstein Relativity theory,\" my initial impression is that this topic can be quite vast and complex, spanning from basic introductory concepts to advanced theoretical discussions. The user might be trying to grasp the fundamental principles of relativity, understand its historical context, or even explore its applications in modern physics. However, without a clear direction, the search results might be overwhelming or not entirely relevant to the user's specific needs.\n\nLet me approach this using the query expansion via user intent and journey mapping technique. This involves creating user personas with diverse expertise levels and motivations, analyzing their search vocabulary, mapping their information journey, identifying contextual scenarios, and finally, extracting intent-based terms.\n\nI start by envisioning different user personas. There's the novice, perhaps a high school student, looking for a simple explanation of Einstein's theory for a science project. Then, there's the interested layperson who wants to understand the basics without delving into complex mathematics. We also have the undergraduate physics student needing detailed explanations for coursework, and the physics researcher seeking specific details or recent publications on the subject.\n\nEach of these personas would use different search terms. The novice might start with \"Relativity explained\" or \"What is Einstein's theory?\" The interested layperson could search for \"Time dilation simple explanation\" or \"General relativity for dummies.\" The undergraduate student would likely look for \"Special relativity basics,\" \"Einstein's postulates,\" or \"Spacetime curvature.\" The researcher, on the other hand, might search for \"Experimental verification of relativity,\" \"Applications of relativity,\" \"Einstein field equations,\" or \"Recent developments in relativity theory.\"\n\nAs I map their information journey, I notice that users progress from basic questions like \"What is relativity?\" to more advanced concepts such as \"Gravitational lensing\" or \"Quantum gravity.\" Along the way, they might explore key concepts like \"Time dilation,\" \"Space-time,\" and \"E=mc^2,\" and delve into the specifics of special and general relativity.\n\nConsidering the various contexts in which users might need this information, I envision scenarios such as writing a science report, preparing for a physics exam, researching for a scientific publication, or simply trying to understand a science documentary. Each scenario reveals different intent-based terms that users might employ in their searches.\n\nBy systematically applying the query expansion technique and interweaving it with natural thought patterns, I begin to see a comprehensive picture of how users with diverse backgrounds and intents would search for information on Einstein's Relativity theory. This process not only helps in identifying high-value terms across the expertise spectrum but also in understanding the contextual vocabulary and intent-revealing terminology that clarifies the search purpose.\n\nAs I synthesize this information, I realize that the expanded query should incorporate a wide range of terms to capture the essence of the users' searches, from basic explanations and key concepts to advanced topics and applications. This approach ensures that the search results are relevant, useful, and cater to the diverse needs of the users.\n\nThrough this process of applying the query expansion technique via user intent and journey mapping, and exploring related threads, I believe the terms identified in the augmented query effectively capture the explicit and implicit aspects of what users are seeking when they search for \"Einstein Relativity theory.\" These terms, such as \"explain,\" \"define,\" \"understand,\" \"learn,\" \"research,\" \"application,\" \"implications,\" \"basics,\" \"advanced,\" \"simple,\" \"theory,\" \"equation,\" \"evidence,\" \"examples,\" \"real-world examples,\" \"history,\" \"biography,\" \"criticisms,\" \"alternative theories,\" \"time dilation,\" \"space-time,\" \"E=mc^2,\" \"postulates,\" \"Lorentz transformation,\" \"gravity,\" \"curvature,\" \"field equations,\" \"black holes,\" \"gravitational waves,\" and \"quantum gravity,\" will provide a comprehensive and inclusive search experience.",
