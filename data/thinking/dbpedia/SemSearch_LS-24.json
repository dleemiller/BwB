  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"Matt Berry TV series,\" this makes me think of his iconic roles in shows like \"The IT Crowd\" and \"What We Do in the Shadows,\" though the user might actually be trying to explore his entire television oeuvre, including lesser-known series or guest appearances. Hmm, not sure yet what the exact focus is, but I'm seeing several possibilities here. Let me approach this using the Query Expansion via Multi-Disciplinary Expert Panel technique, which involves convening a hypothetical panel of experts from diverse disciplines to analyze the query. This should help because it allows for a comprehensive understanding of Matt Berry's TV series from multiple angles, including entertainment journalism, television production, fan communities, and more.\n\nFollowing the expert panel approach, I should first identify the relevant disciplines for this query. That's easy: entertainment journalism, television production, film history, voice acting, and fan community engagement are all crucial. Now, let me create an expert persona for each discipline. For entertainment journalism, I have someone who regularly writes about British comedy and has interviewed Matt Berry. For television production, I've got a producer who has worked on several British sitcoms. My film historian specializes in the evolution of comedy and its societal impacts. The voice acting coach has worked with actors on comedic timing and character development. Lastly, the fan community moderator runs a popular forum dedicated to Matt Berry's work.\n\nEach expert analyzes the query from their perspective, identifying key concepts and methodologies. The entertainment journalist notes the importance of understanding the British comedy scene and its influence on Matt Berry's work. The television producer emphasizes the need to look at production contexts, such as genre and budget, to analyze Berry's roles effectively. The film historian suggests examining historical trends in British comedy to place Berry's series within a broader context. The voice acting coach highlights the significance of Berry's voice acting skills in his comedic performances. The fan community moderator points out popular interpretations and analyses from fans that could shed light on his series.\n\nAs these experts discuss their findings, cross-disciplinary connections emerge. For instance, the influence of British humor on American television is a recurring theme, as well as the evolution of comedic acting styles from stage to screen. The role of voice performance in both animated and live-action comedies also comes into play. They recommend resources such as Matt Berry's interviews, behind-the-scenes documentaries, academic articles on British comedy, and fan forums.\n\nNow, synthesizing their insights, I see that we need to include terms like \"British comedy,\" \"voice acting,\" \"character performance,\" \"sitcom,\" \"dry humor,\" and \"improvisation\" in our expanded query. Applying the multi-disciplinary expert panel technique leads me to also consider \"genre conventions,\" \"comedy trends,\" \"production influence,\" and \"fan reception.\" I just had a realization that connects to what we were exploring earlier - the importance of understanding the production context of Matt Berry's series to fully appreciate his roles and the impact of his performances.\n\nThrough this process of applying the Query Expansion via Multi-Disciplinary Expert Panel technique and exploring related threads, I believe the most effective expanded query would include terms that capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking. This approach not only systematically applies the technique but also allows for natural thought patterns, reconsiderations, and intuitive leaps, ensuring a comprehensive and well-rounded search query.",
