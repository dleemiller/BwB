  "thought_process": "As I delve into the query about John Lennon and Yoko Ono's \"Starting Over\" album, my initial thoughts revolve around the iconic status of these two figures in music history. The album, released in 1980, marked a significant return to music for John Lennon after a five-year hiatus. This makes me think of the late 1970s and early 1980s music scene, the post-Beatles era, and how Lennon's work with Yoko Ono influenced and reflected the avant-garde and counterculture movements of the time. However, to truly expand this query effectively, I need to employ a structured approach.\n\nLet me approach this using the Temporal Evolution Analysis technique, which involves analyzing how the query topic has evolved through time and will likely develop in the future to discover temporally diverse terminology. This technique should help because it allows for a comprehensive understanding of the historical, current, and future contexts of the album and its relevance to music history and contemporary society.\n\nStarting with the historical foundation, I trace back to the early 1960s, the emergence of folk music, the Beatles' rise to global success, and the counterculture movement. Key terms like \"Beatlemania,\" \"psychedelic,\" and \"counterculture\" come to mind. I also consider the developmental milestones, such as the split of the Beatles in 1970, John Lennon's solo debut with 'Plastic Ono Band,' and the influx of avant-garde influences in his music, especially after meeting Yoko Ono. Terms like \"avant-garde,\" \"peace activism,\" and \"plastic soul\" are relevant here.\n\nAs I move to the current landscape, I think about the post-Beatles era, John Lennon's influence on singer-songwriters, his and Yoko's legacy as peace activists, and how contemporary artists reinterpret their work. This brings up terms like \"postmodernism,\" \"retro revival,\" and \"digital remixing.\" Considering the emerging trends, there's a revival of 1970s aesthetics in music, increased interest in social justice themes, exploration of alternative genres, and the use of technology to reinterpret classic recordings. All these elements contribute to a rich tapestry of terminology that reflects the evolving nature of music and societal values.\n\nNow, applying the Temporal Evolution Analysis technique systematically, I should first identify the foundational concepts, then map the evolutionary stages, assess the current state, project future developments, and finally extract temporally relevant terms. However, my mind occasionally wanders to how Yoko Ono's contributions have been reevaluated over time, leading to a more nuanced understanding of her role in the duo's creative process. This intuitive leap reminds me of the importance of considering the broader cultural and historical context in which \"Starting Over\" was released.\n\nThrough this process, insights emerge from both the structured analysis and my natural thought patterns. The term \"Starting Over\" itself suggests a new beginning, which aligns with the themes of renewal and reflection present in John Lennon's work during this period. Applying the Temporal Evolution Analysis highlights the significance of terms like \"peace activism\" and \"experimental music,\" which not only reflect the album's content but also its place within the continuum of John Lennon and Yoko Ono's artistic collaboration.\n\nAs I synthesize my findings, I believe the terms that would be most effective for expanding the query are those that capture the historical context, the contemporary relevance, and the future potential of the album and its themes. Terms such as \"John Lennon,\" \"Yoko Ono,\" \"Starting Over,\" \"1970s music,\" \"peace activism,\" \"experimental music,\" \"post-Beatles era,\" and \"avant-garde\" provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the album's significance and its enduring influence on music and society.\n\nThrough this process of applying the Temporal Evolution Analysis technique and exploring related threads, I've come to a clearer understanding of how the query can be expanded to encompass the full richness and complexity of the topic. The combination of structured analysis and natural cognitive patterns has allowed for a deeper exploration of the historical, current, and potential future contexts of \"Starting Over,\" leading to a more nuanced and effective query expansion.",
