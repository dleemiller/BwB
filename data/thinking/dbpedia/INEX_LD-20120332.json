  "thought_process": "As I delve into the query \"tango dance history,\" my initial thoughts revolve around the rich cultural heritage and the evolution of tango from its roots to its current global phenomenon status. The term \"tango\" itself makes me think of passionate dance movements, Argentina, and the nostalgic melodies of the bandone\u00f3n. However, I'm aware that the user might be looking for a more comprehensive understanding, including its historical development, influential figures, and perhaps its transformation over time.\n\nTo approach this systematically, I decide to employ the Query Expansion via Temporal Evolution Analysis technique. This method involves dissecting the topic into its historical foundation, developmental milestones, current landscape, and emerging trends to uncover a diverse set of temporally relevant terms.\n\nStarting with the historical foundation, I consider the origins of tango in the Rio de la Plata region, the influence of European immigration, and the roles of Compadritos and Arrabal in shaping the early tango culture. Terms like \"Milonga,\" \"Canyengue,\" and \"Guardia Vieja\" emerge as significant in understanding the dance's beginnings. This historical context is crucial because it lays the groundwork for the evolution of tango.\n\nMoving into the developmental milestones phase, I reflect on how tango evolved, especially during its Golden Age in the 1940s, and the impact of figures like Astor Piazzolla, who introduced Nuevo Tango. The influence of cinema and the Broadway show \"Tango Argentino\" also played significant roles in tango's internationalization. These milestones not only changed the dance itself but also expanded its vocabulary, incorporating terms like \"Orquestas T\u00edpicas\" and \"Nuevo Tango.\"\n\nAssessing the current landscape, it's clear that tango has become a global phenomenon, with \"Milongas\" (social dance events) and tango schools and festivals found worldwide. The emergence of \"Neo Tango\" and \"Fusion Tango\" indicates the dance form's adaptability and willingness to evolve. Additionally, the use of technology in teaching and performance, as well as the focus on inclusivity and diversity, marks a significant shift in how tango is perceived and practiced today.\n\nLooking towards emerging trends, I notice an increased accessibility of tango through online platforms, a blending of tango with other dance forms, and an emphasis on tango therapy. These trends suggest that tango is not only evolving in its forms and practices but also in its applications and reach.\n\nThrough this temporal evolution analysis, a range of terms emerges that represent the full spectrum of tango's history and its future directions. By compiling these terms - from \"Rio de la Plata\" and \"Compadritos\" to \"Neo Tango\" and \"Fusion Tango\" - I can construct an augmented query that captures the complexity and richness of tango's story.\n\nThe application of the Temporal Evolution Analysis technique, coupled with my initial intuitive grasp of the subject, leads me to a comprehensive set of terms that will enhance the search query. This process demonstrates how a structured approach can be effectively intertwined with natural thought patterns, including reconsiderations, intuitive leaps, and connections, to yield a nuanced and detailed exploration of the topic.\n\nBy synthesizing these insights, I believe the terms extracted from the historical foundation, developmental milestones, current landscape, and emerging trends will provide a robust and temporally diverse query expansion. This expansion not only reflects the explicit aspects of the user's query but also incorporates implicit elements, ensuring a more comprehensive search outcome.\n\nThrough this methodical and thoughtful approach, I have transformed the initial query \"tango dance history\" into a more detailed and expansive query: \"tango dance history Rio de la Plata Compadritos Milonga Canyengue Guardia Vieja Orquestas T\u00edpicas Golden Age Nuevo Tango Milongas Neo Tango Fusion Tango.\" This augmented query is designed to uncover a wide range of relevant information, from the historical roots of tango to its current practices and future directions, thereby addressing the user's inquiry with depth and precision.",
