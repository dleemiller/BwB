  "thought_process": "As I delve into the query \"eagle rock, ca,\" my initial impression is that the user could be looking for a variety of information, ranging from geographical details to cultural attractions. This ambiguity prompts me to think about who might be searching for this information and why. I start to envision different personas: a novice traveler planning a trip to Los Angeles, a local resident seeking community events, a real estate enthusiast researching property values, and a history buff interested in the origins and development of Eagle Rock. Each of these personas has distinct goals, prior knowledge, and vocabularies that would influence their search terms.\n\nI decide to apply the query expansion technique via user intent and journey mapping. This involves systematically analyzing the search vocabulary, information journey, and contextual scenarios for each persona. For the novice traveler, initial searches might include \"eagle rock california\" and \"things to do eagle rock,\" reflecting a broad interest in exploring the area. In contrast, the local resident might search for \"eagle rock events calendar\" or \"history of eagle rock,\" indicating a more specific, community-oriented focus.\n\nAs I map the information journey for these personas, I notice that their search terms evolve from general inquiries like \"what is eagle rock?\" during the awareness stage to more specific queries such as \"best restaurants near eagle rock\" or \"eagle rock real estate market\" during the exploration and research stages. This progression highlights the importance of considering the user's learning path and adapting the search terms accordingly.\n\nThe analysis of contextual scenarios further enriches my understanding. For instance, a problem-solving situation might prompt a search for \"eagle rock community center,\" while a learning context could lead to queries about \"eagle rock history and development.\" Decision-making moments, such as choosing a neighborhood to live in, might involve searches for \"eagle rock homes for sale\" or \"schools in eagle rock.\"\n\nBy extracting intent-revealing terms across these scenarios, I compile a list of high-value terms that reflect the diverse needs and descriptions of users. These terms include \"location information,\" \"things to do,\" \"restaurants,\" \"real estate,\" \"history,\" \"community,\" \"landmarks,\" \"events,\" \"schools,\" \"architecture,\" \"culture,\" \"travel,\" \"neighborhood,\" \"home prices,\" and \"demographics.\"\n\nThrough this structured approach, complemented by intuitive connections and insights, I arrive at an expanded query that captures the essence of user intent and information needs: \"eagle rock, california restaurants and attractions.\" This query not only reflects the explicit aspects of what the user is seeking but also incorporates implicit elements that enhance the search results' relevance and usefulness.\n\nThe methodical application of the query expansion technique, intertwined with natural thought patterns and considerations of user personas, journeys, and scenarios, yields a comprehensive understanding of how to effectively expand a search query. By balancing structured analysis with cognitive intuition, the resulting query is more nuanced and better equipped to satisfy the diverse information needs of users.",
