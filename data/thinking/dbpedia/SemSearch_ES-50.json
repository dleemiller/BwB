  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"Laura Steele Bob and Tom\", my initial impression is that we're dealing with names, possibly of individuals connected through a media or entertainment context. The inclusion of \"Bob and Tom\" makes me think of the radio show \"The Bob & Tom Show\", which could be a starting point. However, without more context, it's difficult to say exactly what the user is looking for. Are they interested in the radio personalities, or is there another connection, perhaps through Laura Steele, that we're missing?\n\nAs I delve deeper, I realize the need for a structured approach to expand this query effectively. Let me apply the \"Query Expansion via Multi-Disciplinary Expert Panel\" technique, which involves gathering insights from various experts to broaden our understanding and search terms. This technique is beneficial because it brings different perspectives and specialized knowledge to the table, ensuring a more comprehensive search.\n\nStarting with the selection of experts, I identify media history, entertainment journalism, radio/podcast production, genealogy, and social media analysis as relevant disciplines. Each of these fields can offer unique insights into the query. For instance, a media historian could provide context on the evolution of radio shows and their impact on popular culture, while a genealogist might uncover family connections between the individuals mentioned.\n\nAs each expert analyzes the query from their perspective, they identify key concepts and methodologies. The media historian notes the significance of understanding cultural trends in the 1970s, especially in relation to radio and television shows like \"That '70s Show\". The entertainment journalist suggests looking into behind-the-scenes stories or interviews that might feature Bob, Tom, and potentially Laura Steele. The radio/podcast producer talks about the importance of audience demographics and the naming conventions in broadcasting. The genealogist recommends exploring historical records for any familial links, and the social media analyst proposes analyzing online profiles for contemporary connections.\n\nDuring the panel discussion, it becomes clear that there are several cross-disciplinary connections. For example, the media historian and the entertainment journalist both highlight the importance of the 1970s context, while the genealogist and the social media analyst discuss how family ties could influence professional collaborations or public associations. The radio/podcast producer connects the dots between radio show dynamics and potential guest appearances by Laura Steele.\n\nEach expert provides recommendations for resources and terms. The media historian suggests archives like the Paley Center for Media, while the entertainment journalist recommends databases such as IMDb. The genealogist points to websites like Ancestry.com, and the social media analyst proposes searching Twitter and Facebook. The radio/podcast producer mentions the importance of industry publications and historical newspapers.\n\nSynthesizing these insights, we start to see a broader picture. Terms like \"radio show\", \"entertainment industry\", \"media history\", \"genealogy\", \"social media\", and \"1970s culture\" emerge as significant. The technique of using a multi-disciplinary expert panel has helped to uncover dimensions of the query that might have been overlooked, such as the potential for familial connections between Bob, Tom, and Laura Steele, or the relevance of historical cultural trends to their professional activities.\n\nThrough this process, applying the \"Query Expansion via Multi-Disciplinary Expert Panel\" technique has not only systematically expanded our search terms but has also highlighted the importance of interdisciplinary approaches in understanding complex queries. The final expanded query, \"Laura Steele, Bob (radio personality), 1970s entertainment industry connections, genealogy research, social media presence\", reflects the comprehensive insights gathered from our panel of experts, ensuring a more nuanced and effective search.",
