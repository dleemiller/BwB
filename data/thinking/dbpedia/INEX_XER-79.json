  "thought_process": "As I begin to expand the query \"Works by Charles Rennie Mackintosh,\" my initial thoughts revolve around his contributions to architecture and design, particularly his association with the Glasgow School of Art and his influence on the Art Nouveau movement. It's clear that the user is looking for a comprehensive overview of Mackintosh's work, but there might be more to it, perhaps an interest in how his designs have stood the test of time or how they continue to influence contemporary architecture.\n\nTo approach this systematically, I'll use the Temporal Evolution Analysis technique. This involves tracing the evolution of Mackintosh's work and design philosophies over time, from his early days in Glasgow to his international recognition and the post-war era when his influence continued. This technique should help uncover a wide range of relevant terms and concepts that capture the essence of Mackintosh's contributions across different eras.\n\nStarting with the Historical Foundation, I note that Mackintosh's early work in the 1860s in Glasgow laid the groundwork for his future successes. The Glasgow School of Art, where he studied and later taught, was a pivotal institution in his development. His association with William Leiper and his adoption of Art Nouveau and Scandinavian Revival styles were also significant. These elements provide a solid base for understanding his early design philosophies.\n\nMoving on to Developmental Milestones, it's evident that the 1880s were crucial, marking his rise to prominence. His work during this period began to gain recognition, not just locally but also internationally. By the 1900s, Mackintosh was internationally recognized for his unique architectural and design styles, which continued to evolve. Post-World War II, his legacy endured, influencing a new generation of architects who appreciated his emphasis on natural forms and materials.\n\nLooking at the Current Landscape, notable projects such as the Glasgow School of Art (currently under renovation), The Hill House in Helensburgh, Queen's Cross Church, Glasgow, and the House for an Art Lover in Glasgow stand out. These projects showcase not only his historical influence but also how his designs continue to be relevant and cherished today.\n\nConsidering Emerging Trends, it's interesting to see how sustainability and eco-friendly practices in architecture are drawing inspiration from Mackintosh's focus on natural materials and forms. Moreover, digital technologies are revolutionizing the design process, enabling more complex and innovative designs that might have been unimaginable during Mackintosh's time. This blend of traditional principles with modern technology and concerns offers a rich area for exploration.\n\nAs I step back to reassess, I realize that applying the Temporal Evolution Analysis has provided a comprehensive view of Mackintosh's work and its evolution. From his early beginnings in Glasgow to his current influence on sustainable and digitally enhanced architectural practices, the breadth of his impact is clearer. \n\nNow, extracting Temporal Terms that represent the full spectrum of his work, I have:\n- Historical terms like \"Glasgow School of Art,\" \"Art Nouveau,\" and \"Scandinavian Revival\" that ground his early work.\n- Developmental terms such as \"International Recognition\" and \"Post-War Influence\" that highlight his growth and lasting impact.\n- Current terms including \"Sustainability,\" \"Eco-friendly Practices,\" and \"Digital Technologies\" that show the contemporary relevance of his design philosophies.\n\nThrough this process of applying Temporal Evolution Analysis and exploring related threads, I believe the expanded query should effectively capture the essence of Charles Rennie Mackintosh's contributions and their enduring influence on architecture and design. The terms extracted from this analysis will provide a rich and temporally diverse set of keywords for a comprehensive search on Mackintosh's work and legacy.",
