  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"Give me all books by William Goldman with more than 300 pages,\" this makes me think of a reader seeking substantial literary works, perhaps looking for immersive experiences. Though the user might actually be trying to find out which of Goldman's books are the most time-consuming to read, or maybe they're looking for detailed descriptions to ensure the books align with their reading preferences. Hmm, not sure yet...\n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here, but let me approach this using the Query Expansion via Community Q&A Patterns technique, which involves analyzing how the query would evolve in a community Q&A platform. This should help because it allows us to tap into how real people discuss and seek information on this topic, potentially uncovering aspects of the query that aren't immediately apparent.\n\nFirst, let's reframe the original query into various question types. For instance, \"What is it like to read a lengthy William Goldman book?\" or \"How should I choose a William Goldman book that's substantial enough for my reading preferences?\" These reframed questions help us understand the underlying motivations and the kind of information the user might be seeking.\n\nFollowing the technique, I need to identify the hidden motivations behind the query. The user might be seeking validation or reassurance that the books they're about to invest time in are worth it. Perhaps they're looking for decision support, trying to decide which of Goldman's longer works to read first. Identifying these motivations can help us pinpoint the kind of information that would be most valuable to the user.\n\nNow, let's consider the answer archetypes. Valuable responses might include first-person narratives from readers who have experience with Goldman's longer books, expert opinions on the literary value of these works, or practical advice on how to choose a substantial book that fits the user's reading preferences.\n\nIn terms of community interactions, we can anticipate follow-up questions about the content and themes of Goldman's books, debates about which editions are the most complete, or requests for summaries to gauge interest. These interactions can provide clues about the types of terms and phrases people use when discussing Goldman's works in a Q&A context.\n\nAs I apply the technique, I notice that terms like \"long read,\" \"page-turner,\" \"substantial,\" and \"detailed descriptions\" keep emerging. These terms reflect how people naturally discuss books when looking for recommendations or sharing experiences. Applying the Query Expansion via Community Q&A Patterns technique leads me to consider not just the literal query but the broader context of how people interact with information about books.\n\nI just had a realization that connects to what we were exploring earlier - the importance of understanding the reader's intent. The user isn't just looking for a list of books; they're seeking an experience. This realization makes me want to reconsider the expanded query to ensure it captures this nuance.\n\nThrough this process of applying the Query Expansion via Community Q&A Patterns technique and exploring related threads, I believe the terms that would be most effective for expanding the query are those that reflect the natural, conversational way people discuss books. Terms like \"longest books,\" \"worth the time,\" \"complete edition,\" and \"detailed descriptions\" emerge as key. These terms capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking - not just books with more than 300 pages, but substantial, engaging reads that are worth the investment of time.",
