  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"butte montana,\" my initial impression is that the user is looking for information about the city of Butte, Montana, rather than the geographical formation. This makes me think of the rich history and culture of Butte, as well as its significance in Montana's mining industry. Though the user might actually be trying to learn more about the city's attractions, history, or local businesses, the original search results seem to be misinterpreting the intent by focusing on buttes within the state.\n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here, but to approach this systematically, I'll use the expansion technique provided, which involves being specific and diverse, applying varied augmentation techniques such as synonym replacement, conceptual expansion, contextual expansion, and domain-specific terminology. This should help because it allows for a targeted and novel expansion of the query, avoiding generic terms and focusing on introducing new dimensions to the query.\n\nStarting with goal elucidation and gaps, the primary objective of the query is to find information about Butte, Montana, with gaps in understanding the city's history, culture, and attractions. The ineffective term here is \"butte\" because it's too broad and leads to results about geographical formations rather than the city.\n\nFor breadth expansion, considering the city's history and its significance in Montana's mining industry, terms like \"copper mining,\" \"Montana history,\" \"mining towns,\" \"Silver Bow County,\" and \"urban development\" come to mind. These terms expand on the concept of Butte, Montana, by considering its economic and historical context.\n\nDelving deeper into one of these topics, let's consider \"copper mining\" as a pivotal aspect of Butte's history and economy. This leads to a depth expansion where terms like \"historic mining district,\" \"Copper King,\" \"Mining Museum,\" \"folklore and legends,\" and \"economic impact of mining\" become relevant. These terms not only provide a deeper understanding of Butte's mining history but also touch upon the cultural and economic impacts, which are crucial for a comprehensive search.\n\nFollowing the expansion technique, I adjust my approach to ensure that the terms are novel, diverse, and relevant. The terms from the depth expansion, such as \"historic mining district,\" \"Copper King,\" and \"Mining Museum,\" offer a good starting point. Adding terms that provide a broader context, like \"Montana history,\" \"Silver Bow County,\" and concepts related to the cultural and economic aspects of mining in Butte, enhances the query further.\n\nApplying the technique systematically and balancing it with natural thought patterns, I consider how these terms interconnect. For instance, the concept of the \"Copper King\" leads to thoughts about the historical figures who dominated the copper mining industry in Butte, which in turn connects to the \"Mining Museum\" as a potential resource for learning more about this history. The \"economic impact of mining\" reminds me of the significance of copper mining to Butte's development and the state's economy, suggesting that terms related to urban development and local businesses could also be pertinent.\n\nThrough this process of applying the expansion technique and exploring related threads, I believe the terms that would be most effective for a search query are those that capture the essence of Butte, Montana's history, culture, and economic significance. Terms like \"history,\" \"Montana,\" \"Silver Bow County,\" \"Copper King,\" \"Mining Museum,\" \"folklore,\" and \"legends\" emerge as key components of the augmented query. They not only reflect the systematic application of the expansion technique but also incorporate intuitive connections and a deep understanding of the user's likely intent.",
