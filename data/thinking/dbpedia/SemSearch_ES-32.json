  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query \"Fitzgerald Auto Mall Chambersburg PA\", this makes me think of a specific location where someone might be looking to buy a car. Though the user might actually be trying to find more general information about car dealerships in Chambersburg, PA, or perhaps details about the Fitzgerald Auto Mall itself. Hmm, not sure yet... The term \"Fitzgerald\" is quite broad and could refer to many different entities, which might explain why the current results are too broad.\n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here... Let me approach this using the expansion technique, which involves applying various methods such as synonym replacement, conceptual expansion, and domain-specific terminology to discover new, relevant documents. This should help because it allows me to systematically explore different aspects of the query and identify high-quality search terms.\n\nFirst, I need to elucidate the primary objectives of the query. It seems the user wants to locate Fitzgerald Auto Mall, find automobile dealerships in Chambersburg, PA, and gather specific business information about the auto mall. There are gaps in the current query, as it doesn't specify what kind of information the user is looking for, such as sales, services, or reviews.\n\nNext, I identify ineffective terms that should be avoided. The term \"Fitzgerald\" is too broad and could lead to irrelevant results. Other ineffective terms might include general words like \"auto\" or \"car\", as they don't add much specificity to the query.\n\nNow, I'll move on to breadth expansion, where I list candidate terms with increasingly distant concepts to the original query. Some possible terms include \"automobile dealer\", \"car lot\", \"used cars\", \"new cars\", \"Pennsylvania automotive industry\", \"Chambersburg businesses\", \"dealership group\", and \"auto sales\". These terms help to expand the scope of the query and capture related concepts.\n\nFor depth expansion, I choose one distant but important topic from the breadth expansion and go increasingly deeper in the related terms. Let's take \"dealership group\" as an example. I can expand on this term by considering \"automotive franchises\", \"Ford dealerships\", \"GM dealerships\", and \"Chrysler dealerships\". This helps to narrow down the focus and identify more specific and relevant terms.\n\nFollowing the expansion technique, I should first identify the most relevant terms from the depth expansion. In this case, terms like \"Ford\", \"GM\", and \"Chrysler\" seem promising, as they are specific and directly related to the automotive industry. I also notice that the location \"Chambersburg, PA\" is important, so I'll make sure to include that in the augmented query.\n\nAs I apply the technique, I'm also considering my natural thought patterns and intuition. For instance, I realize that the user might be interested in finding a specific type of car or dealership, so I'll try to include terms that capture that nuance. I'm also aware that the query should be novel and free from overlapping the original terms, so I'll make sure to avoid using terms like \"Fitzgerald\" or \"auto mall\".\n\nThrough this process of applying the expansion technique and exploring related threads, I believe the terms that would be most effective for the augmented query are \"Chambersburg, PA auto dealers Ford GM Chrysler\". These terms capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, including location, type of dealership, and specific automotive brands.",
