  "reasoning": "The query is \"Movies with eight or more Academy Awards\". The goal is to retrieve movie titles that have won a significant number of Academy Awards, specifically eight or more. The current results are weak because they mention \"Academy Award\" but fail to list the movies themselves, indicating a need for greater precision and focus on actual winners.\n\nI will accomplish this by creating a conceptual graph that centers on \"Academy Awards\" and \"movies\". Then, I will traverse the graph to find related terms like \"Best Picture\", \"winning films lists\", \"award history\" and \"academy award wins by movie\". This will help find specific titles and quantify the number of awards won by each.",

  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"Movies with eight or more Academy Awards\"... this makes me think of prestigious films that have made a significant impact on the cinema world. Though the user might actually be trying to find a list of all the movies that have achieved this impressive feat, I'm not sure yet how to precisely capture this in a search query. Initially, my mind wanders to films like \"Ben-Hur,\" \"Titanic,\" and \"The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,\" which are known for their numerous Academy Awards. However, the goal is to create a query that can retrieve all such movies, not just the ones I'm familiar with.\n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here... Let me approach this using the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal technique, which involves constructing a conceptual graph around the core concepts of \"Academy Awards\" and \"movies,\" and then traversing this graph to find related terms that can enhance our query. This should help because it allows us to systematically explore the semantic space around our query, potentially uncovering terms and concepts that are Highly relevant but not immediately obvious.\n\nFollowing the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal approach, I should first identify the core concepts and entities in the original query. Here, the central ideas are \"movies\" and \"Academy Awards,\" with a specific focus on those winning eight or more awards. The search intent seems to be informational, aiming to retrieve a list or specifics about these outstanding films. There's an implicit assumption that the query is looking for feature films, not documentaries or short films, which might also win multiple awards.\n\nNow, let's construct our conceptual graph. The core nodes will be \"movies\" and \"Academy Awards.\" First-order connections include terms like \"Best Picture winners,\" \"winning films lists,\" and \"academy award wins by movie.\" Second-order connections might involve \"film genres,\" \"production companies,\" \"directors,\" and \"actors,\" as these can all influence or be associated with a film's success at the Academy Awards. Domain contexts include film history, cinema awards, and possibly the business side of film production.\n\nFor expansion path selection, I'm drawn to synonymous terms (e.g., \"Oscars\" instead of \"Academy Awards\"), hierarchical terms (like \"award categories\" or \"film genres\"), and compositional terms (\"film crews,\" \"production design\"). Contextual terms could include \"film festivals\" or \"critic reviews,\" as these can provide insight into a film's reception and potential for winning awards.\n\nAs I extract and filter terms, I'm looking for those that are highly relevant, distinctive, specific, and likely to appear in relevant documents. Terms like \"most Academy Awards won by a film,\" \"films with multiple Oscars,\" and \"lists of Best Picture winners\" seem promising. Also, considering the specific number \"eight or more\" is key, so terms that quantify award wins could be valuable.\n\nThrough this process of applying the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal technique and exploring related threads, I believe the following terms would be most effective for enhancing our query: \"Best Picture winners,\" \"most Academy Awards won by a film,\" \"films with multiple Oscars,\" \"lists of Academy Award-winning films,\" \"Oscars,\" \"award categories,\" and \"film genres.\" These capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking\u2014 movies that have achieved the prestigious milestone of winning eight or more Academy Awards.",
