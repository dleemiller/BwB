  "thought_process": "As I begin to expand the query \"tango music composers,\" my initial thoughts are centered around the various facets of tango music and its rich history. This makes me think of the legendary composers who have contributed to the genre, though the user might actually be trying to explore the evolution of tango or its cultural significance. The term \"tango\" itself is quite broad, encompassing not just the music, but also the dance and the culture surrounding it. However, focusing on \"composers\" narrows it down to the creative minds behind the music.\n\nTo systematically approach this query expansion, I'll employ the technique of user intent and journey mapping. This involves understanding the diverse perspectives and needs of potential users, from novice enthusiasts to expert scholars. By analyzing how different users would seek information on tango music composers throughout their journey from awareness to expertise, I can create a more comprehensive and inclusive query.\n\nLet's start with user personas. We have the Tango Enthusiast, who is just discovering the world of tango and might be looking for introductory information on key composers and their works. Then there's the Music Scholar, who is likely seeking detailed analyses of tango compositions, historical context, and the influence of various composers on the genre. The Composer's Family Historian represents a more specialized interest, possibly looking for specific information on a particular composer's life, influences, and contributions to tango. Lastly, the Professional Tango Performer would be interested in the practical aspects of tango music, such as compositions suitable for performance, the challenges of interpreting different styles, and the evolution of tango music over time.\n\nAs I consider these personas, I realize the importance of search vocabulary. Each persona would use different terms and have varying levels of knowledge about tango and its composers. For instance, a novice might search for \"famous tango composers,\" while an expert might look for \"neo-tango innovators\" or \"classic tango musicians.\" The journey mapping aspect involves understanding how these information needs change as users progress from basic awareness to deeper understanding and expertise. It's about tracing the path from initial curiosity to specialized knowledge, identifying key terms and concepts at each stage.\n\nThe process also involves identifying contextual scenarios where users need this information, such as researching for a university paper, planning a themed event, curating a music playlist, or writing an article. Each scenario presents unique needs and terminology. For example, someone planning a themed wedding might search for \"traditional South American music\" or \"tango playlist for weddings,\" while a scholar writing an article might look for \"the cultural significance of tango\" or \"the history of tango composition.\"\n\nThrough this analysis, I can extract intent-based terms that reflect the diverse needs and search behaviors of potential users. Terms like \"influential figures,\" \"musical heritage,\" \"comprehensive overview,\" and \"contemporary influences\" emerge as crucial for capturing the essence of what users are seeking. These terms not only cover the who and what of tango composers but also delve into the why and how, providing context and depth to the search query.\n\nBy applying the technique of user intent and journey mapping, I've moved from a straightforward query about tango music composers to a more nuanced understanding of what users might be looking for. The expanded query, \"Exploring the impact and contributions of renowned tango composers throughout history, from classic masters to neo-tango innovators. How have these figures influenced the evolution of tango music?\" reflects this depth, catering to both the informational needs of novices and the analytical requirements of experts.\n\nThis approach demonstrates how structure and intuition complement each other in query expansion. Starting with organic thinking about the query's potential meanings and user intentions, and then systematically applying a technique like user intent and journey mapping, allows for a comprehensive and inclusive query that captures the diversity of user needs and expertise levels.",
