  "reasoning": "To expand the search query \"BPM Governance: An Exploratory Study in Public Organizations,\" it's important to gather diverse expert insights across disciplines relevant to BPM governance. The identified weaknesses, such as the limited focus on BPM specifically within public organizations and the tangential relevance of IT or ESS governance studies, highlight areas for deeper exploration.\n\nThe multi-disciplinary panel approach will leverage various perspectives, including technical, academic, practical (public administration), historical, and social disciplines. Each expert will contribute their unique insights to uncover specialized concepts, methodologies, and terms relevant to BPM in public organizations.\n\nBy integrating these diverse viewpoints, we can formulate an augmented query that encapsulates the broader scope of BPM governance, potentially identifying new resources and dimensions not covered by existing documents. This approach aims to address gaps, clarify terminology across fields, and recommend valuable resources for comprehensive study.",

  "thought_process": "As I delve into the original query, \"BPM Governance: An Exploratory Study in Public Organizations,\" my initial impressions are that this is a complex topic, intersecting business process management (BPM) with governance structures within the public sector. This makes me think of various disciplines that could offer insights, such as information systems, public administration, business analysis, history, and sociology. Though the user might be trying to understand how BPM governance operates within public organizations, they might also be seeking to identify best practices, challenges, or the impact of governance on BPM implementation.\n\nLet's approach this using the \"Query Expansion via Multi-Disciplinary Expert Panel\" technique, which involves gathering insights from experts across different fields relevant to BPM governance. This should help because it leverages a broad range of perspectives, potentially uncovering specialized concepts, methodologies, and terms that might not be immediately apparent.\n\nStarting with the selection of experts, I identify relevant disciplines: Dr. Alex Thompson for technical insights into BPM and IT governance, Ms. Clara Johnson for practical experience in public sector IT governance, Mr. Liam Patel for a business analyst's view on BPM implementation, Prof. Emily Wang to provide historical context on public sector administration, and Dr. Sarah Lee to explore the sociological aspects of governance on organizational culture.\n\nAs each expert analyzes the query, they begin to highlight key areas of focus. Dr. Thompson suggests aligning BPM frameworks with IT governance models to find gaps in public organizations. Ms. Johnson emphasizes understanding regulatory constraints, while Mr. Patel recommends comparative case studies. Prof. Wang notes the importance of historical context, and Dr. Lee underscores the role of organizational culture.\n\nDuring the panel discussion, these experts debate and identify cross-disciplinary connections. For instance, linking IT governance models with BPM frameworks addresses technological constraints, and examining historical changes provides insight into current BPM practices. They also highlight the need for comparative studies between sectors and the importance of considering organizational culture alongside regulatory impacts.\n\nThe experts then provide recommendations, including resources such as the Gartner IT Glossary, OECD E-Government Studies, Harvard Business Review articles, the Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory, and books like 'Leading Change' by John Kotter. They contribute terms like \"IT governance alignment,\" \"regulatory constraints,\" \"historical context,\" \"organizational culture,\" and \"comparative case studies.\"\n\nThrough this systematic approach, combined with the natural flow of ideas and connections among the experts, an augmented query begins to take shape. It's clear that adding dimensions such as IT governance alignment, regulatory constraints, and historical context to the original query could reveal a more nuanced understanding of BPM governance in public organizations.\n\nAs I synthesize the experts' insights, the expanded query becomes: \"BPM Governance: An Exploratory Study in Public Organizations, focusing on IT governance alignment, regulatory constraints, historical context, organizational culture, comparative case studies between public and private sectors, and cross-disciplinary methodologies.\" This query captures the complexity of the topic, reflecting both the structured approach of the expert panel technique and the intuitive connections made during the discussion.\n\nThe final terms for the augmented query emerge from a blend of the systematic application of the expert panel technique and the organic exchange of ideas among the experts. This approach not only expands the query but also enriches our understanding of the subject matter, highlighting the importance of interdisciplinary perspectives in uncovering comprehensive insights into BPM governance within public organizations.",
