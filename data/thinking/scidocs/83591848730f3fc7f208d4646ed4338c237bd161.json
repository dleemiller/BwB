  "reasoning": "The query focuses on \"context-aware security\" with a specific interest in \"context sharing\" within IoT. The existing results are strong on the general concept of context-aware security in IoT but weak on the \"context sharing\" aspect. Therefore, to augment the query, I need to explore the historical evolution, developmental milestones, and current trends of context sharing itself, especially as it relates to security and IoT. This will involve identifying earlier concepts that led to context-aware security, highlighting key advancements, and looking into emerging technologies that facilitate secure and efficient context sharing. I will also identify temporal terms to better refine the search.",

  "thought_process": "As I begin to tackle the task of expanding the query \"Providing Context-Aware Security for IoT Environments Through Context Sharing Feature,\" my initial impression is that the topic is highly specialized and intersects with several areas of computer science and cybersecurity. This makes me think of how context-aware security in IoT environments is a complex issue that involves not just the security of devices, but also how these devices interact with each other and their environment. The user's specific interest in \"context sharing\" within IoT suggests they are looking for information on how to securely share context between devices or systems to enhance security, which is a nuanced aspect of the broader topic.\n\nMy organic thinking leads me to consider how context sharing is a critical component of achieving robust security in IoT environments. However, the existing results are weak on this specific aspect, indicating a need to delve deeper into the historical evolution, developmental milestones, and current trends of context sharing in IoT security. I start to brainstorm key concepts and techniques that might be relevant, such as early access control models, situation-aware computing, and the development of context-aware middleware platforms. It's also important to consider emerging technologies and trends, like blockchain for secure context sharing, edge-based context processing, and AI-driven risk assessment based on shared context.\n\nTo systematically approach this query expansion, I decide to use the \"Query Expansion via Temporal Evolution Analysis\" technique. This involves analyzing how the query topic has evolved over time and will likely develop in the future to discover temporally diverse terminology. The process begins with tracing the historical foundation of context-aware security and context sharing in IoT, which includes identifying foundational concepts and terminology. I note the early access control models like DAC and MAC, the concepts of situation-aware computing, and the challenges of pervasive computing security.\n\nNext, I map the developmental milestones in the topic's development, such as the introduction of policy-based context-aware security, the standardization efforts for context information, and the emergence of attribute-based access control (ABAC). I also consider the development of security frameworks for IoT and the concept of federated identity management. This step helps in understanding how language and concepts have transformed over time, providing a clearer picture of the evolution of context sharing in IoT security.\n\nAssessing the current landscape involves identifying contemporary best practices and leading approaches in context-aware security for IoT, including secure context dissemination protocols, context sharing platforms for smart environments, and the use of blockchain for secure context sharing. It's also crucial to look at privacy-preserving context sharing techniques and AI-driven risk assessment based on shared context.\n\nProjecting how this topic is likely to evolve leads me to consider emerging trends such as federated learning for context model training, homomorphic encryption for context processing, and differential privacy for context dissemination. Decentralized identity and context management, context-aware security orchestration and automation, and the use of digital twins and context virtualization are also on the horizon.\n\nThroughout this process, I compile terminology from each time period, noting terms that have remained relevant across eras and selecting those that provide historical context or future relevance. This includes temporal terms like \"early,\" \"traditional,\" \"recent,\" \"emerging,\" and \"next-generation,\" which help in refining the search to cover the full temporal spectrum of context sharing in IoT security.\n\nAs I apply the \"Query Expansion via Temporal Evolution Analysis\" technique, I find that my initial organic thinking and systematic approach complement each other well. The technique helps in systematically uncovering key concepts and terminologies across different time periods, while my natural thought process allows for the consideration of intuitive connections and potential tangents that might yield unexpected insights.\n\nThrough this process, insights begin to emerge from both the structured approach and my intuition. Applying the technique leads to the discovery of specific terms related to the historical foundation, developmental milestones, current landscape, and emerging trends of context sharing in IoT security. My instinct also suggests considering the intersection of these concepts with other areas of security and technology, further enriching the query expansion.\n\nThe final expanded query, \"Context-aware security\" \"IoT\" \"context sharing\" \"secure context dissemination\" \"privacy-preserving context sharing\" \"distributed trust management\" \"federated identity\" -\"access control\" -\"authentication\" -\"policy enforcement\" -\"survey\" AND (\"early\" OR \"traditional\" OR \"legacy\" OR \"recent\" OR \"contemporary\" OR \"current\" OR \"emerging\" OR \"future\" OR \"next-generation\" OR \"state-of-the-art\" OR \"historical\" OR \"novel\"), captures the essence of the query topic's evolution and current state, incorporating both explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking.\n\nBy synthesizing the insights gained from the systematic application of the \"Query Expansion via Temporal Evolution Analysis\" technique with my natural thought patterns, I believe the expanded query effectively balances structure and intuition, leading to a more comprehensive and relevant search outcome.\n\n[[ ## completed ##",
