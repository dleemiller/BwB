  "thought_process": "As I delve into the query \"Broadband millimetre-wave passive spatial combiner based on coaxial waveguide,\" my initial impression is that this is a highly specialized and technical topic, likely sought after by individuals with a strong background in electrical engineering or a related field. The specificity of the query suggests that the user is looking for detailed information on the design, implementation, or performance of such a combiner. However, to expand this query effectively, I need to consider the broader context and the various user personas that might be interested in this topic.\n\nLet's start by creating user personas. We have the RF Engineer (Novice), who needs to understand the basics of spatial power combining at millimeter-wave frequencies for a class project. Then, there's the Microwave System Designer (Intermediate), designing a high-frequency communication system and needing to evaluate different power combining techniques. The Research Scientist (Advanced) is investigating novel spatial power combining architectures, focusing on minimizing losses and maximizing bandwidth. Lastly, the Product Development Engineer (Expert) is developing a commercial millimeter-wave amplifier and needs the most cost-effective and reliable spatial combiner solution.\n\nConsidering these personas, the search vocabulary will vary significantly. The novice might start with broad terms like \"mmWave power combiner\" or \"millimeter wave amplifier,\" while the intermediate designer would look for \"broadband spatial power combining\" or \"coaxial waveguide combiner efficiency.\" The advanced researcher would likely search for \"passive mmWave combiner design\" or \"quasi-optical power combining,\" and the expert might look for \"coax based millimeter wave combiner\" or \"high frequency power combiner design.\"\n\nTo further expand the query, I'll map the information journey of these users. At the basic level, they might ask, \"What is spatial power combining?\" or \"What are millimeter waves?\" As they progress, they'll seek information on different combining methods, trade-offs between structures, and design considerations like bandwidth and efficiency. Advanced users will delve into novel architectures, optimization techniques, and fabrication processes.\n\nThe usage scenarios also play a crucial role. Users might be designing a 5G/6G base station, developing a radar system, creating a high-frequency test setup, or researching novel amplifier architectures. Each scenario introduces unique terminology and intent, such as \"design,\" \"simulate,\" \"analyze,\" \"compare,\" \"optimize,\" and \"validate.\"\n\nBy analyzing the intent behind the searches, I can extract high-value terms that reflect how users describe their needs. Terms like \"broadband,\" \"passive,\" \"spatial,\" \"coaxial,\" \"millimeter-wave,\" \"efficiency,\" \"bandwidth,\" and \"novel architectures\" are crucial. The intent-revealing terms such as \"design,\" \"implementation,\" \"performance,\" and \"fabrication\" also provide insight into the user's purpose.\n\nThrough this process, I've expanded the original query to capture the diverse needs and terminologies of various users. The augmented query, \"Broadband millimetre-wave passive spatial combiner coaxial waveguide design OR implementation OR performance OR efficiency OR bandwidth limitations OR novel architectures OR fabrication techniques,\" reflects a comprehensive approach to searching for information on this topic.\n\nBy considering user personas, search vocabulary, information journey mapping, contextual scenarios, and intent-based term extraction, I've created an expanded query that should yield more relevant and comprehensive results for users across different expertise levels and contexts.",
