  "thought_process": "As I delve into the query \"What to believe: Bayesian methods for data analysis,\" my initial thoughts revolve around the concept of belief in the context of data analysis and how Bayesian methods provide a framework for updating beliefs based on new evidence. This makes me think of the foundational aspects of Bayesian statistics, such as Bayes' theorem, and how it has evolved over time. The user might be looking for an understanding of how Bayesian methods have developed, their current applications, and perhaps their future directions.\n\nTransitioning to a more structured approach, I'll utilize the Query Expansion via Temporal Evolution Analysis technique. This involves analyzing the topic's evolution through time, identifying key milestones, current practices, and emerging trends. By doing so, we can discover a temporally diverse set of terminology that captures the full spectrum of Bayesian methods in data analysis.\n\nStarting with the historical foundation, I note the 18th-century origins of Bayesian methods, particularly Thomas Bayes' 1763 theorem and Laplace's early 19th-century contributions. The development of prior distributions, likelihood functions, and posterior probability are foundational concepts that have shaped the field. It's interesting to see how these concepts have remained fundamental, even as the field has evolved.\n\nMoving on to developmental milestones, the 1950s saw the term \"Bayesian\" being adopted, the 1990s introduced Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, and the 2000s brought about hierarchical Bayesian models. These advancements not only expanded the methodologies available to practitioners but also transformed the terminology used within the field. For instance, the introduction of MCMC methods marked a significant shift towards more computational approaches, which in turn influenced the development of new software and algorithms.\n\nThe current landscape of Bayesian methods is characterized by the use of credible intervals, software like JAGS, and techniques such as posterior predictive checks and variational inference. The mention of Stan/HMC sampling and Bambi/PyMC3 implementations highlights the ongoing integration of computational power into Bayesian analysis. This period also sees a focus on diagnostics and model selection, indicating a maturation of the field towards more robust and reliable analyses.\n\nAs for emerging trends, probabilistic programming languages, deep learning integration, and big data scalability are pushing the boundaries of Bayesian analysis. The incorporation of gradient-based MCMC and the exploration of Bayesian neural networks suggest a future where Bayesian methods are not only more accessible but also more capable of handling complex data sets. The application of Bayesian methods in natural language processing further underscores their versatility and potential for growth.\n\nNow, synthesizing these insights, the temporal evolution of Bayesian analysis methodologies can be seen as a continuum from historical roots in Bayes' theorem to current practices involving credible intervals and emerging trends towards probabilistic programming and deep learning integration. By considering this evolution, we can identify key terms that represent the historical, current, and future aspects of Bayesian data analysis, thereby augmenting the original query to capture its full temporal spectrum.\n\nThe process of applying the Temporal Evolution Analysis technique has led to the discovery of temporally diverse terminology, from foundational concepts like prior distributions and likelihood functions to current practices involving MCMC and variational inference, and finally to emerging trends such as probabilistic programming and Bayesian neural networks. This systematic approach, combined with the natural flow of thoughts and connections made during the analysis, has enriched our understanding of how Bayesian methods have evolved and are likely to continue evolving in the field of data analysis.\n\nThrough this structured yet intuitively guided process, the augmented query \"Temporal evolution of Bayesian analysis methodologies: historical roots in Bayes' theorem, developmental milestones in MCMC, current landscape of credible intervals, emerging trends in probabilistic programming\" emerges as a comprehensive representation of the query's temporal spectrum. This expansion not only reflects the historical development of Bayesian methods but also their current state and future potential, providing a nuanced and multifaceted exploration of what it means to apply Bayesian principles in data analysis.",
