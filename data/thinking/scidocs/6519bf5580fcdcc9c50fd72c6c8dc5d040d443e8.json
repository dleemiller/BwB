  "thought_process": "As I begin to expand the query \"A survey of multi-source energy harvesting systems,\" my initial impressions are that the user is seeking a comprehensive overview of systems that can harvest energy from multiple sources. This makes me think of various technologies such as solar, wind, and kinetic energy harvesting, though the user might actually be trying to understand how these different sources can be integrated into a single system. I'm not sure yet what specific aspects of multi-source energy harvesting they're interested in, such as design principles, application case studies, or comparative analyses.\n\nTo approach this systematically, I'll use the technique of query expansion, which involves clarifying the user's goal, identifying overly broad terms, expanding the scope, and delving deeper into specific challenges and solutions. This technique should help because it allows for a structured exploration of the topic, ensuring that we cover both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking.\n\nStarting with the original query, I notice that the term \"survey\" might be too broad and not very precise, as it could refer to any kind of overview or study. This leads me to consider what the user might actually be looking for: an overview of multi-source energy harvesting, integration strategies, challenges in multi-source systems, system design principles, or application case studies. I'm seeing several possibilities here, and I need to ensure that my expansion captures the essence of the user's query without being too generic.\n\nTo expand the query effectively, I'll apply the structured approach of identifying ineffective terms, broadening the scope, and then deepening the search into specific areas. The term \"survey\" is ineffective because it's too general and doesn't provide clear direction for the search. Broadening the scope involves considering related concepts such as energy management, power electronics, hybrid systems, wireless power transfer, microgrid, distributed energy resources, and optimization algorithms. These terms introduce new dimensions to the query, moving beyond the original focus solely on multi-source energy harvesting systems.\n\nAs I delve deeper, I choose to focus on \"power management\" as a critical aspect of multi-source energy harvesting systems. This involves considering voltage regulation, current matching, maximum power point tracking, energy storage, and load balancing. These terms are more specific and targeted, addressing the integration challenges and solutions that are likely of interest to the user.\n\nIn applying the technique, I've systematically expanded the query to include terms that are both relevant and diverse. The process has involved clarifying the user's goals, avoiding overly broad terms, expanding the scope to encompass system-level considerations, and delving deeper into specific integration challenges and solutions. This structured approach, combined with natural cognitive elements such as reconsidering initial impressions and making intuitive connections, has led to the development of an augmented query that is novel, free from overlapping the original terms, and targeted at uncovering new, relevant documents across various domains.\n\nThrough this process of applying the query expansion technique and exploring related threads, I believe the augmented query should effectively capture the user's interests in multi-source energy harvesting systems. The final terms emerge logically from both the technique and natural insights, ensuring a comprehensive and targeted search.",
