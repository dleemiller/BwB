  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"Learning to Rank Non-Factoid Answers: Comment Selection in Web Forums\", this makes me think of the complexities involved in evaluating and ranking comments that don't provide straightforward factual information. The user might actually be trying to understand how to effectively assess the relevance and usefulness of comments in web forums, which is a challenging task due to the subjective nature of non-factoid content. Hmm, not sure yet how to approach this, but it seems like we need to delve into both the technical aspects of ranking algorithms and the more nuanced aspects of human judgment and context.\n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here, but let me approach this using the \"Query Expansion Through Journalistic Investigation\" technique, which involves treating the query as a story to be researched and expanded upon. This should help because it encourages a deep dive into the subject matter, considering various real-world contexts, expert insights, and specific terminology.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the query more deeply. What is the user truly seeking? They want to learn about ranking non-factoid answers, which suggests they're looking for methods to evaluate the quality and relevance of comments that aren't just factual. This involves understanding the assumptions and knowledge gaps they might have, as well as identifying any unexpressed needs, such as how to incorporate user feedback or context into the ranking process.\n\nConsidering real-world contexts, this query could be relevant in professional settings, such as content moderation teams trying to improve the quality of discussions on their platforms. It could also be important in educational settings, where students are taught how to critically evaluate information and contribute to online discussions. Personally, individuals might want to understand how to effectively engage with and curate content in online communities they participate in.\n\nNow, let's look into resource investigation. Notable experts in natural language processing, information retrieval, and human-computer interaction could provide valuable insights. Established methodologies like semantic analysis, neural networks, and knowledge graph integration are crucial. Essential terminology includes \"non-factoid answers,\" \"comment ranking,\" \"semantic similarity,\" and \"user context.\" Organizations like the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and institutions with strong computer science departments are involved in advancing this field.\n\nCreating headlines for articles addressing the query from multiple angles can help extract key terms and concepts. For example, \"Beyond Factoid Answers: Novel Approaches to Ranking Meaningful Comments\" or \"The Future of Comment Ranking: Leveraging Deep Learning and User Feedback.\" These headlines suggest terms like \"novel approaches,\" \"meaningful comments,\" \"deep learning,\" and \"user feedback\" are relevant.\n\nExtracting specific terms from these headlines and considering the broader context, we have terms like \"non-factoid answers,\" \"comment ranking,\" \"semantic analysis,\" \"neural networks,\" \"user context,\" \"forum dynamics,\" \"discourse quality,\" \"relevance scoring,\" and \"personalized recommendations.\" These terms capture both the technical and the more subjective, human-centered aspects of the query.\n\nThrough this process of applying the \"Query Expansion Through Journalistic Investigation\" technique and exploring related threads, I believe the terms that would be most effective for expanding the query are those that reflect the complexity of evaluating and ranking non-factoid answers. These include terms related to semantic analysis, user context, and personalized recommendations, as they capture the essence of what makes a comment relevant and useful in a non-factoid context.",
