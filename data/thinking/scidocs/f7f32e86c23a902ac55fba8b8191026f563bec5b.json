  "reasoning": "The original query 'Subjectivity and Sentiment Analysis of Modern Standard Arabic' seeks insights into how computational techniques are applied to analyze emotions, opinions, and subjectivity in Arabic text. The documents primarily focus on sentiment analysis methodologies but also touch upon subjectivity to a lesser extent. While the collection offers technical depth in algorithmic approaches, it might not fully explore subjectivity as its own analytical dimension. This creates an opportunity to expand the query by incorporating additional relevant factors and contexts that could enhance understanding and application.",

  "thought_process": "As I delve into the query \"Subjectivity and Sentiment Analysis of Modern Standard Arabic,\" my initial thoughts are about the nuances of natural language processing (NLP) and how they apply to Arabic, a language known for its complexity and rich linguistic features. The user's interest seems not just in understanding sentiment analysis, which is relatively more explored, but also in subjectivity analysis, which can be more challenging due to its subjective nature. This makes me think about the distinctions between sentiment and subjectivity in the context of Arabic NLP, and how each is approached in technical and research communities.\n\nTo expand this query effectively, I'll adopt the \"Query Expansion Through Journalistic Investigation\" technique. This involves treating the query as a story to be fully fleshed out, seeking diverse real-world contexts, authoritative sources, and specific terminology that experts in the field would use.\n\nFirst, I assess the query to understand what lies beneath the surface. The user is seeking insights into subjectivity and sentiment analysis in Modern Standard Arabic, which implies a need to understand both the theoretical underpinnings and practical applications of these analyses. There's an assumption here that the user wants to go beyond mere sentiment analysis, which is commonly discussed, and dive deeper into the less explored territory of subjectivity.\n\nIdentifying real-world scenarios where this query is relevant is crucial. This could include professional contexts such as marketing research, where understanding public sentiment and subjectivity towards products or services is invaluable. Educational settings, like universities offering courses in NLP or Arabic linguistics, could also benefit from deeper insights into subjectivity analysis. On a personal level, individuals interested in social media monitoring or opinion mining in Arabic-speaking regions might find this information useful.\n\nThe next step involves investigating resources and identifying notable experts, methodologies, essential terminology, and organizations involved in Arabic NLP. Experts in Arabic linguistics, computer science, and cognitive psychology could provide valuable insights. Methodologies might include machine learning models tailored for Arabic text analysis, such as those that account for dialectical variations and linguistic nuances. Essential terminology could range from technical terms like \"part-of-speech tagging\" and \"named entity recognition\" to more subjective analysis terms like \"emotive language\" and \"contextual inference.\"\n\nCreating diverse headlines to address the query from multiple angles helps to extract relevant terms. For example:\n- \"Unlocking the Power of Arabic Subjectivity Analysis: A Beginner's Guide\"\n- \"Advanced Sentiment Analysis Techniques for Modern Standard Arabic Texts\"\n- \"The Future of Arabic NLP: Challenges and Opportunities in Subjectivity Detection\"\n- \"A Comparative Study of Machine Learning Models for Arabic Sentiment and Subjectivity Analysis\"\n\nFrom these headlines, specific terms can be extracted, such as \"Arabic subjectivity analysis,\" \"sentiment analysis techniques,\" \"machine learning models for Arabic NLP,\" \"contextual understanding in Arabic texts,\" and \"dialectical challenges in Arabic subjectivity detection.\" These terms not only reflect the original query's intent but also expand upon it by incorporating real-world contexts, expert terminology, and the nuances of Arabic NLP.\n\nThrough this process of applying the \"Query Expansion Through Journalistic Investigation\" technique, I've moved from an initial query that was fairly broad to a more nuanced and detailed understanding of what the user might be seeking. The expanded query now incorporates a range of terms and concepts that reflect both the technical aspects of NLP and the specific challenges and opportunities presented by the Arabic language.\n\nThe final augmented query is: \"Subjectivity and Sentiment Analysis of Modern Standard Arabic focusing on Arabic subjectivity analysis, sentiment analysis techniques, machine learning models for Arabic NLP, contextual understanding in Arabic texts, dialectical challenges in Arabic subjectivity detection, and preprocessing techniques for handling Arabic linguistic nuances.\"\n\nThis approach has allowed me to balance structured technique with natural cognitive patterns, ensuring that the final terms emerge logically from both the technique and natural insights, providing a comprehensive and well-rounded expansion of the original query.",
