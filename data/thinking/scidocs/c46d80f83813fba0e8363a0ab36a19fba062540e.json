  "reasoning": "The query 'Learning Actionable Representations with Goal-Conditioned Policies' primarily aims to uncover research at the intersection of learning representations conditioned on goals within the field of reinforcement learning (RL) and artificial intelligence. The focus seems to be on techniques that enable agents to learn representations which directly facilitate goal achievement, particularly in complex environments. Current strengths lie in providing diverse technical insights into this topic through various machine learning approaches, including model-based RL and policy optimization methods. However, weaknesses indicate a lack of specificity beyond the first result, suggesting that there is room for exploration into more nuanced or application-specific contexts within AI and ML research related to goal-conditioned policies. This might include diving deeper into specific use cases such as robotics or autonomous systems where these concepts are highly applicable. The breadth of topics currently covered includes dialog systems and relational planning, which diverge from the central theme of actionable representations conditioned on goals. As a result, expanding the query will aim to introduce terms that align more closely with the specificity of goal-conditioned representation learning within targeted application domains.",

  "thought_process": "As I delve into the original query, \"Learning Actionable Representations with Goal-Conditioned Policies,\" my initial impression is that this is a highly specialized topic within the realm of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), specifically focusing on reinforcement learning (RL). The query seems to aim at uncovering techniques that enable agents to learn representations that are directly useful for achieving specific goals, particularly in complex environments. This makes me think of applications in robotics, autonomous systems, and other areas where goal-oriented behavior is crucial.\n\nTransitioning to a more structured approach, I decide to apply a technique that involves understanding the primary objectives and gaps in the original query, identifying ineffective terms, expanding the query to include broader but relevant concepts, and then diving deeper into one of these concepts to create a more targeted and precise query. This technique, which we can call \"Focused Expansion,\" involves systematically analyzing the query's intent, broadening the scope to include related domains, and then narrowing down to specific, high-relevance terms that can yield more precise and diverse search results.\n\nApplying the Focused Expansion technique, I start by elucidating the goals and gaps in the original query. The primary objective is to learn actionable representations conditioned on goals, with a gap in specificity beyond general technical insights, suggesting a need to explore more nuanced or application-specific contexts. Next, I identify ineffective terms that are too broad or not precise, such as \"dialog,\" \"relational planning,\" and \"rule-based,\" which, although relevant in some contexts, do not align closely with the core theme of goal-conditioned representation learning.\n\nFor breadth expansion, I consider terms that introduce new dimensions while remaining relevant to the core theme. Terms like \"robotics,\" \"autonomous navigation,\" \"task-oriented learning,\" \"human-robot interaction,\" and \"sensorimotor representations\" come to mind as they expand the query into areas where goal-conditioned policies are highly applicable. Among these, \"robotics\" stands out as a fertile ground for depth expansion, given its direct relevance to autonomous systems and the potential for goal-conditioned policies to enhance robot performance in complex tasks.\n\nDiving deeper into \"robotics,\" I explore related terms that progressively narrow down to more specific and relevant concepts. Starting with \"autonomous agents,\" I move to \"robot perception,\" then to \"sensor fusion,\" and finally to \"perception-action loop.\" These terms not only align with the original query's focus on actionable representations but also introduce a level of specificity that can yield targeted search results in the domain of robotics and autonomous systems.\n\nThrough this process of applying the Focused Expansion technique and exploring related threads, I emerge with a set of terms that are both diverse and targeted. The final augmented query, \"robotic systems autonomous agents sensor fusion perception-action loop,\" captures the essence of goal-conditioned representation learning in the context of robotics and autonomous systems, offering a precise and relevant set of search terms that can uncover novel and valuable research in this area.",
