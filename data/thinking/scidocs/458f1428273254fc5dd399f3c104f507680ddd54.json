  "thought_process": "As I begin to expand the query \"Measuring discrimination in algorithmic decision making,\" my initial thoughts revolve around the complexity of the topic and the diverse group of users who might be searching for this information. This makes me think of students researching for projects, data scientists implementing fairness metrics, machine learning researchers exploring novel bias mitigation techniques, and policymakers developing regulations for fair AI systems. The user might be trying to understand the basics of algorithmic bias, or they might be looking for advanced techniques to measure and mitigate discrimination in AI systems.\n\nTo approach this systematically, I'll use the query expansion technique via user intent and journey mapping. This involves creating user personas, analyzing search vocabulary, mapping the information journey, identifying contextual scenarios, and extracting intent-based terms. By doing so, I aim to capture the nuances of how different users would search for information on measuring discrimination in algorithmic decision making throughout their journey from novice to expert.\n\nLet's start with user personas. I envision four distinct personas: a novice student, an intermediate data scientist, an advanced machine learning researcher, and an expert policymaker. Each persona has different goals, prior knowledge, and vocabulary. For instance, the novice might start with searches like \"what is algorithmic bias,\" while the expert policymaker might search for \"fairness-aware algorithms\" or \"social impact assessment of AI.\"\n\nTransitioning to search vocabulary analysis, it's clear that each persona's search terms will evolve as they progress in their understanding. The novice might initially use terms like \"algorithmic fairness\" and \"bias in machine learning,\" gradually moving to more specific terms like \"fairness metrics\" and \"adversarial debiasing\" as they become more intermediate. The advanced researcher would likely search for terms such as \"statistical parity,\" \"equal opportunity,\" and \"causal inference for fairness,\" reflecting their deeper dive into the theoretical foundations of fairness.\n\nMapping the information journey, I consider how the information needs change from entry-point questions like \"What is algorithmic discrimination?\" to intermediate learning milestones such as understanding different types of bias and measurement techniques, and finally to advanced concepts like the limitations of current approaches and open research questions. For experts, the journey might involve evaluating policy implications, legal frameworks, and best practices for fair AI system development.\n\nContextual scenarios also play a crucial role. For academic research, users might seek to understand the nature and impact of algorithmic bias. In model development, the focus would be on implementing fairness considerations. Policymakers would be interested in evaluating the fairness of existing AI systems and developing regulations, while public awareness efforts would involve educating the public about the risks of biased algorithms.\n\nFinally, extracting intent-based terms from all personas and scenarios, I look for terms that reflect the high-value information needs across the expertise spectrum, contextual vocabulary from different scenarios, and intent-revealing terminology. Terms like \"understand bias,\" \"measure fairness,\" \"mitigate discrimination,\" \"develop fair models,\" \"evaluate algorithmic impact,\" and \"promote ethical AI\" emerge as crucial. These terms not only capture the essence of measuring discrimination in algorithmic decision making but also reflect how users with diverse backgrounds and expertise levels would describe their information needs.\n\nThrough this process of applying the query expansion technique via user intent and journey mapping, and by considering the natural thought processes and intuitive connections that complement this structured approach, I believe the expanded query should include terms that cater to the diverse information needs of users. This would ensure that search results are relevant and helpful across the spectrum of user expertise and contexts.\n\nThe final expanded query, considering both the structured technique and the natural cognitive patterns, would logically include terms such as \"algorithmic discrimination in machine learning,\" \"fairness metrics,\" \"mitigation techniques,\" \"real-world case studies,\" and \"ethical considerations.\" These terms encapsulate the essence of what users are seeking when they inquire about measuring discrimination in algorithmic decision making, from basic understanding to advanced research and policy development.",
