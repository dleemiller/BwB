  "reasoning": "The query focuses on applying deep learning to analyze bank distress events through news and financial data integration. Key insights from the provided documents highlight two main approaches: one using advanced ML models (Random Forest, neural networks) with regulatory metrics[1][3], and another leveraging financial news analysis via techniques like Doc2Vec embeddings[4]. The user likely seeks understanding of how news narratives combined with quantitative data enhance predictive power for bank stress scenarios. The goal is to identify methodologies, challenges, and real-world applications of such systems, emphasizing both textual (news) and numerical (financial) data roles.",

  "thought_process": "As I begin to tackle the query \"Bank distress in the news: Describing events through deep learning,\" I'm immediately struck by the complexity of integrating news analysis with financial data for predictive purposes. This makes me think of the challenges in extracting meaningful signals from noisy data, such as news articles, and how deep learning can be leveraged to identify patterns that may not be apparent through traditional financial analysis. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the methodologies and applications of such systems, I sense there's an underlying curiosity about the potential of deep learning to enhance predictive power in the banking sector.\n\nTo approach this systematically, I'll use the journalistic investigation technique for query expansion, which involves treating the query as a story that needs comprehensive research and real-world context. This technique involves several steps, starting with assessing the query to understand what the user is truly seeking. \n\nUpon analyzing the query, it becomes apparent that the user is looking for a deep dive into how deep learning models can analyze news and financial data to predict bank distress events. This involves understanding the methodologies, challenges, and real-world applications of such systems. The user's query goals revolve around clarifying these methodologies, assessing the capabilities and limitations of deep learning models, identifying optimal indicators, exploring cross-model comparisons, and analyzing feature interpretability.\n\nThe next step in the journalistic investigation technique is identifying diverse real-world scenarios where the query is relevant. This could include professional contexts such as financial institutions, educational settings focusing on finance and machine learning, personal situations involving investment decisions, and specialized communities like financial analysts and AI researchers. Historical contexts, such as the 2008 Global Financial Crisis and more recent bank stress incidents, also play a crucial role in understanding the evolution of bank distress prediction methodologies.\n\nFollowing this, I investigate real, authoritative sources of information on the topic. Notable experts in financial machine learning, established methodologies like Random Forest and neural networks, essential terminology such as Doc2Vec embeddings and regulatory metrics, and organizations involved in financial stability and AI research are all critical components. \n\nCreating diverse headlines that could introduce articles addressing the query from multiple angles helps to further expand the query. Examples include \"Breaking Down Bank Stress Signals: How Deep Learning Decodes News Cycles and Financial Metrics,\" \"Deep Learning's News Edge: Predictive Power of Media Narratives in Banking Sector Stability,\" and \"From Headlines to Distress Signals: AI Tackles Financial Jargon in Media Reports.\" These headlines not only reflect the core of the user's query but also touch upon related topics such as the predictive power of news narratives, the role of AI in financial analysis, and the integration of traditional financial ratios with textual risk markers.\n\nExtracting specific terms from these headlines and the overall analysis gives us high-value search terms such as \"doc2vec embeddings,\" \"shap values,\" \"random forest sensitivity,\" \"regulatory buffers,\" \"textual risk markers,\" \"default classification,\" and \"CET1 ratios.\" These terms are significant because they represent precise concepts related to the query, include terminology experts would use, and cover related topics and peripheral areas.\n\nThrough this process of applying the journalistic investigation technique and exploring related threads, I believe the expanded query effectively captures the complexities and nuances of the original query. The integration of real-world contexts, expert insights, and specific terminology enhances the search query, making it more comprehensive and likely to yield relevant results.\n\nThe final expanded query, \"Bank distress event modeling using deep learning and news TEXT analysis,\" combined with the extracted terms, should provide a powerful tool for exploring the methodologies, challenges, and applications of deep learning in predicting bank distress events through news and financial data analysis.",
