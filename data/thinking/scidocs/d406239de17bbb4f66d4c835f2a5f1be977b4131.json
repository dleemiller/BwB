  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"Affordances as a Framework for Robot Control,\" this makes me think of the concept of affordances in a broader sense, beyond just robotics. Though the user might actually be trying to understand how affordances can be applied in robotics, I sense there's a deeper interest in exploring the theoretical underpinnings and their potential applications across different domains. \n\nThe objective seems to be about clarifying core affordance principles in robotics, identifying new implementations post-2019, linking Gibson's psychology to technical applications, and exploring interdisciplinary relevance beyond robotics. To achieve this, I need to transition from these initial impressions to a more structured approach.\n\nLet me approach this using the expansion technique, which involves being specific and diverse, focusing on targeted expansions that introduce new dimensions to the query, and applying varied augmentation techniques such as synonym replacement, conceptual expansion, contextual expansion, and domain-specific terminology. This should help because it ensures the augmented query is novel, free from overlapping the original terms, and captures the essence of what the user is seeking in a comprehensive manner.\n\nFollowing the expansion technique, I should first identify the primary objectives and gaps in the original query. The query seeks to understand affordances in robotics but lacks specificity and depth, particularly in terms of recent trends and interdisciplinary connections. The gaps include the need for more precise concepts, recent developments, and a broader application scope.\n\nNext, I need to list broad or non-precise terms that should be avoided. Terms like \"framework,\" \"robot,\" \"universal,\" and \"*\" are too generic and do not contribute to a focused search. Instead, I should opt for more precise concepts like \"embodied cognition,\" \"sensorimotor integration,\" and specific applications or theories related to affordances.\n\nFor breadth expansion, I'll consider terms that introduce new dimensions but remain relevant to the query. This includes ecological psychology foundations, sensorimotor system architectures, cognitive robotics, human-robot shared control models, embodied cognition principles, and multimodal affordance recognition. These terms expand the search scope while maintaining a connection to the core concept of affordances in robotics.\n\nIn depth expansion, I choose to delve deeper into ecological psychology and its connection to robotics, specifically focusing on Gibson's affordance theory, action-oriented perception systems, robotic sensorimotor integration, and embodied computation in AI. This approach allows for a nuanced understanding of how affordances are perceived and applied in robotic systems, bridging the gap between psychological theory and technical implementation.\n\nAs I apply the technique's steps systematically, I also consider natural cognitive elements that might enhance the search query. For instance, the concept of embodied cognition reminds me of the importance of sensorimotor learning in robots, which could lead to more effective affordance detection and application. Similarly, exploring human-robot interaction (HRI) models that incorporate affordance-based reactive systems could provide insights into more intuitive and adaptive robotic control.\n\nThrough this process of applying the expansion technique and exploring related threads, I believe the terms that would be most effective for an augmented query are those that capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking. The augmented query should reflect a balance between the structured approach of the technique and the natural insights gained from exploring the concepts and their interconnections.\n\nTherefore, considering the systematic application of the expansion technique, the natural thought patterns, and the insights gained, the final augmented query is: embodied cognition in robotics, Gibsonian affordance perception, sensorimotor learning, action-oriented HRI, ecological psychology robotics, cognitive control architectures, multimodal affordance detection, embodied AI applications, affordance-based reactive systems.",
