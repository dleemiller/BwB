  "reasoning": "The objective is to expand the original query by considering various user personas, their unique vocabulary needs at different stages of information discovery, and contextual scenarios in which they might search for this information. The primary goal is to incorporate more terms relevant to \"glass substrates,\" alongside other key elements pertinent to 5G technologies like phased arrays, beamforming, and millimeter-wave frequencies.\n\nGiven the strengths and weaknesses identified in the document types returned by the current search results\u2014mainly academic papers or technical reports on engineering aspects of wireless communication\u2014it's clear that while relevant technological details are covered, there is a specific gap concerning \"glass substrates.\" This suggests the need to focus more precisely on this aspect for potential users who require detailed information about material considerations in 5G antenna design.\n\nThe reasoning process involves constructing personas with varying levels of expertise, mapping their vocabulary evolution as they move through different stages of understanding (awareness, learning, and application), and identifying practical scenarios where such knowledge might be sought. By doing so, the expanded query can better reflect user intent across a spectrum from novice to expert, increasing the likelihood of retrieving more pertinent documents.",

  "thought_process": "As I delve into the original query, \"First Demonstration of 28 GHz and 39 GHz Transmission Lines and Antennas on Glass Substrates for 5G Modules,\" my initial impression is that this is a highly technical query targeting a specific aspect of 5G technology, particularly the use of glass substrates in antenna design. The user seems to be interested in the demonstration of transmission lines and antennas on glass substrates, which suggests a focus on the material properties and their application in 5G modules.\n\nGiven the complexity and specialized nature of this query, I consider the expansion technique of \"Query Expansion via User Intent and Journey Mapping.\" This approach involves understanding how different users, with varying levels of expertise and motivations, would search for this information. By mapping their journey from awareness to expertise, we can identify key terms and concepts that might not be immediately apparent from the original query.\n\nStarting with user personas, I envision four distinct characters: a novice electronics enthusiast curious about emerging technologies, an intermediate engineering student focused on material properties for design projects, an advanced RF engineer seeking the latest in antenna technology, and an expert wireless communication researcher specializing in millimeter-wave applications. Each persona has unique goals, motivations, and prior knowledge, influencing their search vocabulary and contexts.\n\nFor the novice enthusiast, initial searches might include \"5G antennas basics\" or \"millimeter-wave communication for beginners.\" In contrast, the advanced RF engineer might search for \"phased arrays with glass substrates\" or \"beamforming technology in 5G.\" The expert researcher could be looking for \"latest research on glass substrates in RF engineering\" or \"impact of glass substrates on 5G antenna efficiency.\" By analyzing the search vocabulary across these personas, we can identify a spectrum of terms reflecting different stages of understanding and expertise.\n\nAs I map the information journey for these users, I notice that their needs evolve from basic concepts to more specialized and advanced topics. The novice starts with an interest in 5G frequency bands, while the expert delves into cutting-edge applications and performance impacts of innovative materials. This progression highlights the importance of considering the user's learning path and the terminology they would use at different stages.\n\nThe contextual scenarios where users need this information also provide valuable insights. For instance, a professional might be optimizing 5G module designs using glass substrates, while an academic might be working on a project requiring the selection of appropriate antenna materials. These scenarios underscore the practical applications and decisions that users face, further informing the expansion of the query.\n\nThrough this analysis, I extract intent-based terms that reflect the diverse ways users describe their needs. Terms like \"5G millimeter-wave frequencies,\" \"antenna design and efficiency,\" \"phased array applications,\" and \"beamforming technologies\" emerge as crucial. Additionally, the focus on \"glass substrates for RF engineering\" and \"millimeter-wave glass antennas research\" highlights the specialized nature of the query.\n\nBy systematically applying the query expansion technique and interspersing it with natural thought patterns, I've been able to uncover a richer set of terms and concepts that better capture the user's intent. The expanded query, \"First Demonstration of 28 GHz and 39 GHz Transmission Lines and Antennas on Glass Substrates for 5G Modules focusing on phased arrays, beamforming technologies, millimeter-wave frequencies, efficiency impacts of glass substrates, and advanced research in RF engineering,\" reflects this comprehensive approach.\n\nThis thought process demonstrates how combining structured techniques with organic thinking can lead to a more nuanced understanding of user needs and preferences. By embracing the complexity of real-world searches and incorporating the diverse perspectives of various user personas, we can develop more effective search queries that better serve the information needs of users across the spectrum of expertise.",
