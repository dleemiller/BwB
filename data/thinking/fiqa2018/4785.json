  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"What is the difference between a structured collar and a normal collar in finance?\"... this makes me think of financial instruments and risk management strategies, though the user might actually be trying to understand the nuances of options trading or hedging. Hmm, not sure yet... The terms \"structured collar\" and \"normal collar\" seem to be the key, but I need to dig deeper to provide a meaningful comparison.\n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here... Let me approach this using the expansion technique, which involves systematically examining the query's objectives, identifying ineffective terms, expanding the breadth of related concepts, and then delving deeper into specific areas of interest. This should help because it allows me to methodically uncover relevant terms that might not be immediately apparent.\n\nStarting with the original query, I notice that the term \"What is the difference\" is quite broad and doesn't add much value to the search. I'll set that aside for now. The main goals seem to be defining \"structured collar,\" comparing it to a \"normal collar,\" and providing financial examples to illustrate the differences.\n\nAs I begin my breadth expansion, I consider terms like \"options strategies,\" \"derivative pricing,\" \"risk management,\" \"financial hedging,\" \"investment portfolio,\" and \"institutional investors.\" These terms are related to the financial context of the query but are somewhat distant from the specific concept of collars.\n\nNow, let's dive deeper into one of these areas. I choose \"portfolio hedging\" as a starting point for my depth expansion. This leads me to consider \"option contract structures,\" \"exotic options,\" \"customized collars,\" and \"market volatility.\" These terms start to get at the nuances of structured collars and how they differ from normal collars in the context of managing risk and volatility in investment portfolios.\n\nFollowing the expansion technique, I should first identify the key characteristics of structured collars... Wait, that's not quite right for this query. Let me adjust my approach to focus more on the comparison between structured and normal collars. This step of the technique is revealing the importance of understanding the specific financial instruments and strategies involved... which actually reminds me of the concept of \"delta hedging\" and how it might relate to the management of risk in portfolios.\n\nI need to consider the next step in the technique, which involves looking at the depth expansion terms and selecting those that are most relevant and non-overlapping with the original query. This leads me to terms like \"exotic options\" and \"market volatility,\" which are critical in understanding the differences between structured and normal collars.\n\nApplying the specific aspect of the technique related to depth expansion leads me to discover terms like \"customized collars\" and \"option contract structures.\" These terms are directly relevant to the query and provide a deeper understanding of structured collars. I just had a realization that connects to what we were exploring earlier... the idea that structured collars are often tailored to meet the specific risk management needs of an investment portfolio, which is different from the more generic approach of normal collars.\n\nThrough this process of applying the expansion technique and exploring related threads, I believe the terms that would be most effective for a search query are those that capture the essence of structured collars in finance, such as \"exotic options,\" \"market volatility,\" \"customized collars,\" and \"option contract structures.\" These terms synthesize the structured approach with natural insights, providing a clear and targeted query that should yield relevant results.",
