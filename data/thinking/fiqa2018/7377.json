  "reasoning": "The query pertains to the specific type of returns Vanguard quotes, which could involve understanding their methodology in financial reporting. Given the current results focus on qualitative insights and broad performance metrics without directly addressing return types like arithmetic or geometric means, we need to augment the query with relevant historical, developmental, and terminological context related to these concepts. By exploring how the concept of 'returns' has evolved and is discussed in financial literature over time, we can enhance the precision and relevance of the search.",

  "thought_process": "As I begin to expand the query \"What type of returns Vanguard is quoting?\", my initial thoughts revolve around understanding the context of financial reporting and performance metrics. The user is specifically interested in the type of returns, which could range from arithmetic to geometric means, or even more complex calculations like the Sharpe Ratio or Total Return Index. My first association is with the foundational concepts in finance, such as the distinction between arithmetic and geometric means, and how these have been discussed in early finance literature.\n\nTransitioning to a more structured approach, I decide to apply the Temporal Evolution Analysis technique. This involves tracing the historical development of the topic, identifying key milestones, assessing the current state, and projecting future trends. I start by considering the historical foundation, noting how mathematicians like Leonard Euler emphasized the geometric mean for compounded growth rates, and how modern portfolio theory has evolved to include various return measures.\n\nAs I delve into the developmental milestones, I recognize the adoption of the geometric mean in evaluating long-term fund performance, the introduction of the Sharpe Ratio, and the development of Total Return Indexes. These steps are crucial because they not only highlight the evolution of financial metrics but also indicate how the terminology and concepts have transformed over time.\n\nThe current landscape reveals a preference for geometric means in mutual funds and ETFs, standardization in financial reporting, and regulatory encouragement for transparency in return measures. However, my natural thought process occasionally diverges, considering tangents like the impact of regulatory changes on financial reporting standards and how this might affect Vanguard's quoting methods.\n\nInterspersing these structured steps with natural cognitive elements, I also consider emerging trends. The growing interest in sustainable investment metrics incorporating ESG factors and the use of AI for personalized portfolio insights could significantly influence how returns are calculated and quoted in the future. This reminds me of the importance of including terms related to these trends in the expanded query.\n\nThrough the Temporal Evolution Analysis, I systematically compile terminology from each time period, identifying terms that have remained relevant and those that provide historical context or future relevance. This process leads to the extraction of key terms such as arithmetic mean, geometric mean, CAGR, Sharpe Ratio, Total Return Index, ESG metrics, and machine learning analytics.\n\nAs I synthesize these insights, I realize that applying the Temporal Evolution Analysis technique has not only helped in understanding the historical and current context of the query but also in anticipating future developments. The final terms for the expanded query\u2014arithmetic mean, geometric mean, CAGR, Sharpe Ratio, Total Return Index, ESG metrics, and machine learning analytics\u2014emerge logically from both the structured technique and the natural insights gained during the thought process.\n\nBy balancing the structured approach of the Temporal Evolution Analysis with natural cognitive patterns, I've been able to create an expanded query that captures both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking: \"What specific type of returns (arithmetic vs. geometric) does Vanguard quote in their financial reporting and performance metrics, considering historical methods and modern regulatory standards?\"\n\nThis thought process demonstrates how experts can use a structured technique to systematically analyze a query while also allowing for the integration of intuitive connections, reconsiderations, and creative insights, ultimately leading to a more comprehensive and relevant query expansion.",
