  "thought_process": "As I delve into the query \"Pay off credit card debt or earn employer 401(k) match?\", my initial impression is that this is a classic dilemma in personal finance, pitting the urgency of debt repayment against the long-term benefit of retirement savings. The user is likely seeking a strategy that balances these competing priorities. My association is that this decision hinges on several factors, including the interest rates on the credit card debt, the amount of the debt, the employer's 401(k) match percentage, and the individual's risk tolerance and financial goals.\n\nTo approach this systematically, I'll employ the query expansion technique via conceptual graph traversal. This involves analyzing the query, constructing a conceptual graph, selecting expansion paths, extracting terms, and finally filtering these terms to find the most relevant and distinctive ones.\n\nFirst, I identify the core concepts in the query: \"credit card debt,\" \"employer 401(k) match,\" \"pay off,\" and \"investment/retirement savings.\" The search intent here is informational, with the user seeking guidance on making a financial decision. Implicit assumptions include the availability of funds to either pay off debt or invest in a 401(k) and the importance of maximizing financial benefits.\n\nNext, I construct a conceptual graph. The core nodes are \"credit card debt\" and \"401(k) match.\" First-order connections include \"interest rates,\" \"debt repayment strategies,\" and \"retirement savings benefits.\" Second-order connections might involve \"budgeting,\" \"investment strategies,\" and \"financial planning tools.\" The domain context is personal finance, with a focus on debt management and retirement planning.\n\nFor expansion path selection, I consider several directions:\n- **Synonymous terms**: Alternative phrases for debt repayment or retirement savings.\n- **Hierarchical terms**: Broader concepts like \"personal finance\" or narrower ones like \"high-interest debt.\"\n- **Compositional terms**: Components of the decision, such as \"emergency funds\" or \"investment portfolios.\"\n- **Contextual terms**: Scenarios where this decision is critical, like \"financial crises\" or \"long-term financial planning.\"\n- **Domain-specific terminology**: Terms specific to finance, such as \"compound interest\" or \"tax-advantaged accounts.\"\n\nExtracting and filtering terms, I look for relevance, distinctiveness, specificity, and searchability. For example, terms like \"debt avalanche,\" \"debt snowball,\" \"retirement contribution,\" and \"tax-advantaged investing\" are relevant and distinctive, offering specific strategies within the personal finance domain.\n\nThrough this process, insights emerge from both the structured approach and natural thought patterns. Applying the conceptual graph traversal technique leads to the discovery of terms like \"high-interest debt reduction\" and \"retirement contribution maximization,\" which are directly relevant to the user's query. Intuitively, I also consider the importance of \"financial risk assessment\" and \"optimal asset allocation\" in making such a decision, as these factors can significantly impact the outcome of the user's financial strategy.\n\nSynthesizing this information, I believe the expanded terms should include a mix of debt management strategies, retirement savings options, and broader financial planning concepts. These terms will enhance the original query by providing alternative pathways for document retrieval, thereby offering the user a more comprehensive set of resources to inform their decision.\n\nThe final expanded terms could include:\n- High-interest debt reduction\n- Retirement contribution maximization\n- Tax-advantaged investing\n- Debt avalanche vs. debt snowball\n- Financial risk assessment\n- Optimal asset allocation\n- Emergency fund planning\n- Investment compounding\n- Long-term financial planning\n- Personal finance strategies\n\nThese terms maintain the original search intent while offering valuable alternative perspectives for retrieval. The augmented query would then be: \"Pay off credit card debt OR maximize employer 401(k) match? Consider high-interest debt reduction, retirement contribution maximization, and tax-advantaged investing. Debt avalanche vs Debt Snowball, and factors like financial risk assessment, optimal asset allocation, and emergency fund planning.\"",
