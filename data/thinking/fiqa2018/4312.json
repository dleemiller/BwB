  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"Is it true that 90% of investors lose their money?\"... this makes me think of how often I've heard similar statistics tossed around in financial discussions, though the user might actually be trying to understand the underlying dynamics of investment outcomes. Initially, I'm not sure what to make of the 90% figure - it seems high, but perhaps there's truth to it. My first instinct is to consider all the factors that could contribute to such a statistic: market volatility, lack of financial literacy, poor investment strategies, and more. However, I realize that simply listing factors won't provide a comprehensive understanding. \n\nLet me approach this using the Query Expansion via Metaphorical Thinking technique, which involves generating powerful metaphors for the query topic and mining them for conceptually related terminology from diverse domains. This should help because metaphors can reveal complex relationships and offer insights that might not be immediately apparent through traditional analysis.\n\nFollowing the technique, I start with metaphor generation. The idea that investment is like navigating a vast ocean comes to mind. Just as sailors need to understand currents, storms, and how to read navigational charts, investors must navigate market trends, economic storms, and use their own version of \"charts\" - perhaps historical data and risk assessment tools - to make informed decisions. Another metaphor that emerges is comparing the stock market to an ecosystem in nature. In ecosystems, balance is crucial, and similarly, diversification is key to a resilient investment portfolio. The gardening metaphor also appears, where the investment timeline is akin to nurturing plants - patience and the right care over time yield growth.\n\nAs I continue, the metaphors of conducting a complex symphony and assembling a mosaic also seem fitting. In conducting, balancing diverse assets is like orchestrating different musical elements into harmony, and in mosaic assembly, building a well-diversified portfolio is akin to creating a cohesive picture from various fragments. Each of these metaphors offers a unique lens through which to view investment and market dynamics.\n\nNow, let's map these domains to the target domain of investment. The navigational charts, currents, and storms in ocean navigation correspond to investment strategies, market volatility, and risk management. The biodiversity, symbiosis, and ecological balance in ecosystems relate to diversification, interdependence of market components, and the need for balance in a portfolio. The seeds, soil nutrients, and seasonal cycles in gardening parallel the investment timeline, the need for nourishment (or growth opportunities) for investments, and adapting to economic cycles.\n\nExploring the language used in these metaphors further reveals terms like navigational charts, biodiversity, nutrients, harmony, and patterns. These terms, when applied to investment, offer a fresh perspective on how to approach investor behavior and market dynamics. For instance, considering the \"navigational charts\" for investments, we might look into historical data analysis and risk assessment tools more closely. The concept of \"biodiversity\" in portfolios suggests the importance of diversification for resilience.\n\nExtending these metaphors, we can see how each provides a framework for understanding different aspects of investment. For example, just as a sailor must adapt to changing weather conditions, an investor must be ready to adjust strategies based on market movements. The ecosystem metaphor emphasizes the importance of balance and interdependence, suggesting that investors should look at how different components of their portfolio interact and affect each other.\n\nAs I synthesize these thoughts, I realize that the process of applying the Query Expansion via Metaphorical Thinking technique has led me to a more nuanced understanding of the query. The initial impulse to simply verify or refute the 90% statistic has given way to a deeper exploration of what factors contribute to investment outcomes and how investors can navigate these challenges. Through this metaphorical exploration, terms such as navigational charts, biodiversity, nutrients, harmony, and patterns emerge as valuable for understanding investor behavior and market dynamics.\n\nThus, the augmented query that captures the essence of our exploration could be: \"Explore the validity of the claim that 90% of investors lose their money through analysis of market dynamics, investor behavior studies, and statistical evidence on investment outcomes, utilizing insights derived from metaphorical analyses of investment as navigation, ecosystem balance, gardening, symphony conducting, and mosaic assembly.\"",
