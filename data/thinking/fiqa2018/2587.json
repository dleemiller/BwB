  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"Typically how many digits are in a cheque number?\"... this makes me think of banking and financial transactions, though the user might actually be trying to understand the standard formatting of cheque numbers, which could vary by country or institution. Hmm, not sure yet how to approach this, but it seems like we're dealing with a mix of numerical standards and possibly some international variations.\n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here... Let me approach this using the expansion technique, which involves identifying the primary objectives of the query, pinpointing ineffective terms, expanding the query through breadth and depth analysis, and finally, synthesizing the findings into a novel and precise augmented query. This should help because it allows us to systematically uncover new dimensions of the query while avoiding overly broad or non-precise terms.\n\nStarting with goal elucidation, the primary objective is to determine the typical digit count in cheque numbers and explore common length conventions and potential variations. The term \"Typically\" seems too broad and could be considered an ineffective term, as it doesn't add much specificity to the query. \n\nFor breadth expansion, we look at concepts that are increasingly distant but still related, such as \"cheque numbering system,\" \"bank account identifiers,\" \"financial transaction codes,\" and \"payment instrument standards.\" These terms help us understand the broader context of cheque numbers within financial transactions.\n\nNow, let's dive deeper into one of these areas. The concept of \"bank account identifiers\" seems rich for depth expansion. Within this, we can explore \"account identifier length,\" \"international bank account numbering (IBAN),\" \"check digit algorithms,\" and \"magnetic ink character recognition (MICR) specifications.\" This depth analysis is revealing specific aspects that could influence the length and format of cheque numbers, such as the use of IBAN, which has a fixed length and includes check digits for error detection.\n\nThis step of the technique is revealing the importance of standardization in banking... which actually reminds me of the ISO standards for banking and financial transactions. Considering these standards, the use of MICR and IBAN is crucial for international transactions, suggesting that cheque numbers might adhere to specific length and formatting standards to facilitate these transactions.\n\nHowever, I need to consider the diversity and specificity of the terms for the augmented query. The terms should be unique, non-overlapping with the original query, and targeted towards the depth expansion analysis. The augmented query has already been formulated as \"account identifier length IBAN check digit MICR,\" which captures the essence of our analysis by focusing on the specific aspects of account identifiers, international banking standards, and error checking mechanisms.\n\nThrough this process of applying the expansion technique and exploring related threads, I believe the terms in the augmented query effectively capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking. These terms are specific, diverse, and targeted, ensuring a novel and precise search query that avoids ineffective terms and logical operators, aiming to yield high-quality, relevant results.",
