  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"How can all these countries owe so much money?  Why & where did they borrow it from?\", this makes me think of complex financial systems and global economics. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the basics of national debt and international borrowing practices, hmm, not sure yet... \n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here, from the role of financial institutions like the International Monetary Fund to the impact of interest rates on borrowing. Let me approach this using the Conceptual Graph Traversal technique for query expansion, which involves analyzing the query, constructing a conceptual graph, selecting expansion paths, and extracting high-value terms. This should help because it systematically uncovers related concepts and terms that can enhance the search query.\n\nFollowing the Conceptual Graph Traversal approach, I should first identify core concepts and entities in the original query. Here, we have countries, debt, borrowing, and money as central themes. The search intent appears to be informational, as the user is seeking to understand a phenomenon. There's an implicit assumption that the borrowing is primarily from international or financial institutions.\n\nNow, constructing the conceptual graph... We have core nodes like countries, debt, and borrowing. First-order connections include the relationships between these nodes, such as countries borrowing money and incurring debt. Second-order connections might involve economic factors, interest rates, and global debt dynamics. The domain context is clearly international finance and economics.\n\nIdentifying promising directions for query expansion... I see paths for synonymous terms (e.g., \"nations\" for \"countries\"), hierarchical terms (like \"sovereign debt\" as a type of debt), compositional terms (such as \"bond markets\" as a part of borrowing mechanisms), contextual terms (e.g., \"global financial crisis\" as a setting), and domain-specific terminology (like \"fiscal policy\" and \"macroeconomics\").\n\nFor each expansion path, I need to extract high-value terms. For synonymous terms, \"nations\" and \"states\" could work. Hierarchical terms might include \"public debt\" and \"external debt\". Compositional terms could be \"creditors\", \"lenders\", and \"financial instruments\". Contextual terms might include \"economic stability\", \"trade deficits\", and \"foreign investment\". Domain-specific terms could be \"monetary policy\", \"inflation rate\", and \"economic growth\".\n\nFiltering these terms for relevance, distinctiveness, specificity, and searchability... I find that terms like \"sovereign debt\", \"fiscal policy\", \"macroeconomics\", \"creditors\", \"financial instruments\", \"economic stability\", and \"foreign investment\" are particularly promising. They maintain the original search intent while offering alternative pathways for retrieval.\n\nThrough this process of applying Conceptual Graph Traversal and exploring related threads, I believe these terms would be most effective for enhancing the original query. They capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking.",
