  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"All the indicators show that global warming is still happening,\" this makes me think of the need for concrete evidence and scientific consensus to support the claim. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the current state of global warming, the query lacks specificity in terms of sources or types of indicators. Hmm, not sure yet how to expand this effectively, but it seems like we need to delve into more precise language related to climate change and its impacts.\n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here, but let me approach this using the expansion technique provided, which involves being specific and diverse, applying varied augmentation techniques like synonym replacement, conceptual expansion, and using domain-specific terminology. This should help because it will allow us to introduce new dimensions to the query without overlapping with the original terms.\n\nFirst, examining the query for its primary objectives and gaps, it's clear the goal is to confirm global warming and find scientific evidence, but there's a gap in specific sources and verifiable information. The terms \"indicators\" and \"all\" seem too broad and non-precise, so they should be avoided in the expanded query.\n\nFor breadth expansion, considering concepts increasingly distant from the original query, terms like \"climate change impacts,\" \"greenhouse gas emissions,\" \"temperature anomalies,\" \"sea level rise,\" and \"extreme weather events\" come to mind. These capture a wider scope of the effects and factors related to global warming.\n\nNow, focusing on depth expansion, if we choose \"climate models\" as a distant but important topic, we can delve deeper into related terms such as \"feedback loops,\" \"carbon sequestration,\" \"mitigation strategies,\" and \"adaptation measures.\" These terms not only provide a deeper understanding of the mechanisms behind climate change but also offer insights into potential solutions and responses.\n\nApplying the expansion technique systematically, I should first identify high-quality search terms that are novel and do not overlap with the original query. The terms from the depth expansion, such as \"climate models,\" \"feedback loops,\" and \"mitigation strategies,\" are strong candidates because they introduce new dimensions and specificity to the search.\n\nWait, that's not quite right for this query; let me adjust my approach to ensure the terms are not only diverse and targeted but also relevant and precise. Considering the original query's focus on confirming global warming, terms related to evidence and scientific research, like \"temperature anomalies\" and \"greenhouse gas emissions,\" are essential. They provide a direct link to the query's objectives while expanding its scope.\n\nThis step of the technique is revealing the importance of combining both the breadth and depth of expansion to capture the complexities of global warming. It actually reminds me of the related concept of \"sustainability,\" which might also be relevant in understanding long-term strategies for mitigating climate change effects.\n\nI need to consider the next step in the technique, which involves selecting terms that are contextually or peripherally relevant to the original query, but I'm also noticing an interesting pattern where terms like \"sea level rise\" and \"extreme weather events\" are not just effects of global warming but also areas of active research and policy development.\n\nFollowing the technique pointed me toward \"climate models\" and related terms, but my instinct says we should also consider how these models are used in \"carbon sequestration\" efforts and \"adaptation measures\" to provide a more comprehensive view of the current research and action landscape.\n\nThrough this process of applying the expansion technique and exploring related threads, I believe the terms that would be most effective for a search query are those that capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking. This includes terms from the depth expansion like \"climate models,\" \"feedback loops,\" and \"mitigation strategies,\" as well as relevant terms from the breadth expansion that provide a wider context, such as \"greenhouse gas emissions\" and \"temperature anomalies.\"\n\nThe final step is synthesizing these insights with clarity to form an augmented query that is novel, diverse, and targeted, ensuring it contains only high-quality search terms without logical operators, duplicates, or ineffective words. This query should be able to yield results that are non-overlapping with the original query, providing new and valuable information on the topic of global warming.",
