  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"In 1905, PDO switched to a warm phase,\" this makes me think of climate patterns and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). Though the user might actually be trying to understand the implications of this phase switch or how it affects global climate trends, the query itself seems quite specific. It's focused on a particular event in climate history, so I need to consider terms that will help clarify this event and its context.\n\nTo begin expanding this query, I'll apply the Conceptual Graph Traversal technique. This involves analyzing the query, constructing a conceptual graph, selecting expansion paths, extracting terms, and finally filtering those terms based on relevance, distinctiveness, specificity, and searchability.\n\nFirst, let's identify the core concepts and entities in the original query: \"Pacific Decadal Oscillation,\" \"warm phase,\" and \"1905.\" The search intent appears to be informational, aiming to find details about this specific event in climate history. There's an implicit assumption that the user is interested in the climate aspects of the PDO's warm phase, possibly its effects or the climate records from that time.\n\nConstructing the conceptual graph, we have core nodes like \"Pacific Decadal Oscillation,\" \"warm phase,\" and \"1905.\" First-order connections include properties of the PDO, such as its definition, effects on climate, and historical data. Second-order connections might involve related climate phenomena like El Ni\u00f1o, La Ni\u00f1a, or the North Pacific Gyre. Domain contexts include climate science, oceanography, and historical climate records.\n\nFor expansion path selection, I identify several promising directions:\n- Synonymous terms: Using different words to describe the \"warm phase,\" such as \"positive phase\" or \"anomalous warmth.\"\n- Hierarchical terms: Broader concepts like \"climate patterns\" or narrower ones such as \"North Pacific climate anomalies.\"\n- Compositional terms: Attributes of the PDO's warm phase, like \"sea surface temperature anomalies\" or \"atmospheric circulation patterns.\"\n- Contextual terms: Settings or scenarios where the PDO's warm phase is relevant, such as \"global warming,\" \"regional climate impacts,\" or \"oceanic heat content.\"\n- Domain-specific terminology: Field-specific terms from climate science, such as \"teleconnections,\" \"climate indices,\" or \"decadal variability.\"\n\nNow, extracting terms along these paths and filtering them based on the criteria:\n- Relevance: Terms must be strongly connected to the PDO and its warm phase.\n- Distinctiveness: Terms should offer new information not covered by the original query.\n- Specificity: Terms need to be precise, avoiding overly broad concepts.\n- Searchability: Terms should be likely to appear in relevant climate literature or databases.\n\nSome high-value terms that emerge from this process include \"North Pacific climate variability,\" \"sea surface temperature anomalies,\" \"decadal climate patterns,\" \"global climate impacts,\" and \"historical climate records.\" These terms maintain the original search intent by focusing on the PDO's warm phase and its climate implications while providing alternative pathways for retrieval.\n\nThrough this process of applying Conceptual Graph Traversal and exploring related threads, I believe the expanded terms would be most effective for enhancing the search query. These terms capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, from the specific event of the PDO switching to a warm phase in 1905 to the broader context of climate patterns and historical records.",
