  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"They changed the name from 'global warming' to 'climate change',\" this makes me think of the broader context of environmental science and how language around it has evolved over time. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the historical reasons behind this terminology shift, I'm also considering the potential implications of this change on public perception and scientific discourse. Hmm, not sure yet, but it seems like there's more to this query than just a simple linguistic adjustment.\n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here... Let me approach this using the Query Expansion via Community Q&A Patterns technique, which involves analyzing how the query would evolve in a community Q&A platform. This should help because it allows me to explore the query from various angles, identify hidden motivations, and extract valuable terminology that reflects real conversations around this topic.\n\nFirst, I'll try reframing the original query into different question types. For instance, \"What is the history behind the shift from 'global warming' to 'climate change'?\" or \"How does the change in terminology affect our understanding of environmental issues?\" This helps me understand the various ways people might be asking about this topic.\n\nNext, I'll consider what the asker might really be seeking. Are they looking for validation of their current understanding, or perhaps seeking advice on how to communicate about climate change effectively? Identifying these hidden motivations can guide me toward more relevant and user-centric expansions.\n\nNow, let's examine valuable response patterns. In this case, first-person experience narratives from scientists, policymakers, or activists could provide unique insights. Expert opinions with credibility markers, such as citations or references to peer-reviewed studies, would also be highly relevant. Step-by-step practical advice on how to engage in productive conversations about climate change could be valuable as well.\n\nConsidering community interactions, common follow-up questions might include \"What are the implications of using 'climate change' instead of 'global warming'?\" or \"How has the public's response to climate change evolved over time?\" Frequently debated aspects could involve the political implications of terminology changes or the role of media in shaping public perception.\n\nFinally, extracting terminology from conversational language, personal context descriptions, and community-specific jargon will help me capture the nuances of how people discuss climate change in everyday conversations. Terms like \"sustainability,\" \"eco-friendly,\" \"carbon footprint,\" and \"green initiatives\" might emerge as relevant, reflecting the broader context of environmental concerns and actions.\n\nThrough this process, I've expanded my understanding of the query and can now see how the terminology shift from \"global warming\" to \"climate change\" is not just a linguistic change but also reflects evolving scientific understanding, public awareness, and political discourse. Applying the Query Expansion via Community Q&A Patterns technique has allowed me to uncover a richer set of terms and questions that capture the complexity and depth of the user's inquiry.\n\nSynthesizing this information, I believe the expanded query should include terms and phrases that reflect the historical, scientific, and social aspects of the terminology shift. This approach ensures that the search results will provide a comprehensive understanding of the topic, addressing not only the explicit question but also the underlying motivations and related discussions that occur in community Q&A contexts.",
