  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query \"Trudeau's carbon tax will raise gas prices by 11 cents/litre,\" this makes me think of the economic and environmental implications of such a policy. The user might actually be trying to understand the broader effects of carbon taxation on the economy and the environment, rather than just the specific impact on gas prices. Hmm, not sure yet, but it seems like there are several layers to this query.\n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here... Let me approach this using the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal technique, which involves analyzing the query, constructing a conceptual graph, and then traversing it to find relevant expansion terms. This should help because it allows us to systematically explore related concepts and identify high-value terms that can improve document retrieval.\n\nFirst, I'll analyze the query and identify the core concepts and entities. We have \"Trudeau,\" \"carbon tax,\" and \"gas prices\" as the main entities, and the search intent seems to be informational, as the user is looking to understand the impact of the policy. There are also implicit assumptions about the relationship between carbon taxation and gas prices.\n\nNext, I'll construct the conceptual graph. The core nodes will be \"Trudeau,\" \"carbon tax,\" and \"gas prices.\" First-order connections might include \"climate change,\" \"emissions reduction,\" and \"energy policy,\" as these are direct properties or attributes of the core concepts. Second-order connections could be \"environmental policies,\" \"taxation,\" and \"government spending,\" which are related concepts one step removed. The domain context is clearly \"Canada,\" given the mention of Trudeau.\n\nNow, I need to select promising directions for query expansion. I think synonymous terms, hierarchical terms, and contextual terms could be useful. For example, \"carbon pricing\" is a synonymous term for \"carbon tax,\" while \"energy policy\" is a broader concept that encompasses \"gas prices.\" Contextual terms like \"climate change mitigation\" or \"sustainable energy\" could also provide valuable insights.\n\nAs I traverse the graph and extract terms, I need to filter them based on relevance, distinctiveness, specificity, and searchability. I'm looking for terms that have a strong semantic connection to the original query, are precise rather than general, and are likely to appear in relevant documents.\n\nFollowing the technique, I should first identify the core concepts, which are \"Trudeau,\" \"carbon tax,\" and \"gas prices.\" Then, I'll explore the expansion paths, such as synonymous terms like \"carbon pricing\" and hierarchical terms like \"energy policy.\" Wait, that's not quite right for this query... Let me adjust my approach to focus more on the economic and environmental implications of carbon taxation.\n\nThis step of the technique is revealing some interesting insights... which actually reminds me of the related concept of \"emissions reduction\" and how it's connected to \"climate change mitigation.\" I need to consider the next step in the technique, which is term extraction and filtering, but I'm also noticing this interesting pattern where \"environmental policies\" and \"taxation\" are intersecting.\n\nApplying the specific aspect of the technique leads me to discover terms like \"carbon offset\" and \"sustainable energy,\" which are relevant to the query. I just had a realization that connects to what we were exploring earlier... the importance of considering the broader economic and environmental context of carbon taxation.\n\nThrough this process of applying the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal technique and exploring related threads, I believe the following terms would be most effective for expanding the query: \"carbon pricing,\" \"energy policy,\" \"climate change mitigation,\" \"emissions reduction,\" \"sustainable energy,\" \"environmental policies,\" \"taxation,\" \"government spending,\" \"Canada,\" and \"Trudeau's policies.\" These terms capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, and they should provide valuable alternative pathways for retrieval.",
