  "reasoning": "The goal is to expand the search query related to Greenland's ice loss and its contribution to sea level rise by understanding different user intents and contexts. We begin by creating distinct personas, each with unique backgrounds and motivations, influencing how they seek information. This approach allows us to map out varied vocabulary needs, understand progression in their knowledge journey from novice to expert levels, identify specific scenarios where such information is critical, and ultimately enhance the search query with diverse terms that reflect these user intents. By doing so, we ensure the augmented query encompasses a broader spectrum of relevant results across document types like scientific studies and reports.",

  "thought_process": "As I delve into expanding the search query related to Greenland's ice loss and its contribution to sea level rise, my initial thoughts are centered around the diverse user base that might be searching for this information. The original query, \"Greenland's ice loss is accelerating & will add metres of sea level rise in upcoming centuries,\" provides a solid foundation, but I recognize the need to encompass a broader spectrum of user intents and contexts to make the search results more comprehensive and relevant.\n\nMy first step is to create distinct user personas, each with unique backgrounds, motivations, and levels of expertise. This includes an eco-conscious novice looking for simple explanations, a policy maker intermediate seeking reliable data for policy decisions, a climate scientist advanced analyzing scientific studies, and an NGO leader expert aiming to use comprehensive evidence for global policy change. By understanding these personas, I can map out their varied vocabulary needs, progression in knowledge journey, and specific scenarios where such information is critical.\n\nAs I apply the query expansion technique via user intent and journey mapping, I systematically analyze the search vocabulary for each persona. I consider their initial search terms, follow-up searches, and how their vocabulary evolves with increasing expertise. This process reveals a range of terms from basic queries like \"What is Greenland's ice loss?\" to more advanced searches such as \"Scientific studies Greenland ice sheets melting trends\" and \"Current projections of Greenland ice sheet contribution to sea level rise.\"\n\nI then proceed to map the information journey for these users, identifying entry-point questions, intermediate learning milestones, advanced concept exploration vocabulary, and expert-level terminology. This journey mapping helps in understanding how users progress from novice to expert levels, enabling me to capture a wide array of search terms that reflect different stages of knowledge acquisition.\n\nThe next critical step involves identifying specific scenarios where users need this information, including problem-solving situations, learning contexts, decision-making moments, and practical application settings. For instance, a student researching for a school project, a government official preparing for an international climate summit, a scientist conducting research on polar ice dynamics, and an NGO strategist developing educational materials all have unique needs and search patterns.\n\nThrough this structured approach, combined with natural cognitive elements such as occasional reconsiderations and intuitive connections, I extract high-value terms across the expertise spectrum. These include contextual vocabulary from different scenarios and intent-revealing terminology that clarifies the search purpose. Terms like \"global warming,\" \"climate change effects,\" \"IPCC report sea level rise,\" and \"NOAA projections for oceans\" emerge as crucial for capturing the breadth of user intents.\n\nAs I synthesize the insights from both the structured technique and natural thought patterns, I realize that the expanded query needs to incorporate key impacts, scientific projections, and references to significant reports like those from IPCC and NOAA. The final augmented query, \"Greenland's ice loss is accelerating & will add meters of sea level rise in upcoming centuries. Key impacts, scientific projections, IPCC and NOAA reports on glacier dynamics and climate change effects,\" effectively encompasses the diverse needs of various user personas and scenarios, ensuring that the search results are comprehensive and relevant.\n\nThis process demonstrates how a structured technique, when balanced with natural cognitive patterns, can lead to a more effective and inclusive search query expansion. By considering the nuances of user intents, knowledge journeys, and specific usage scenarios, we can develop search queries that better serve the information needs of a wide range of users.",
