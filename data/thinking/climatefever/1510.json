  "thought_process": "As I delve into the query about doubling the concentration of atmospheric CO2 and its impact on global warming, my initial impression is that this is a complex, multifaceted topic. The query itself provides a basic understanding but lacks specificity about the magnitude of warming under different scenarios. This makes me think about the broader context of climate change, including historical trends, the role of other greenhouse gases, and feedback mechanisms.\n\nMy first step is to clarify the context: what specific timeframe are we considering? Is it the short-term effects of CO2 doubling or the long-term implications? This question leads me to think about the Industrial Revolution as a significant turning point in human-caused CO2 emissions and how it has impacted our current situation.\n\nTo expand this query effectively, I decide to use the \"Query Expansion Through Journalistic Investigation\" technique. This approach involves analyzing the user's true needs beneath the surface query, identifying real-world scenarios where the query is relevant, and investigating resourceful information from authoritative sources.\n\nStarting with the query assessment, I recognize that the user is seeking a precise temperature increase caused by doubling CO2 concentration but also wants to understand the influence of other forcings and feedback mechanisms. This indicates a need for both factual information and conceptual understanding.\n\nMoving to real-world contexts, I identify scenarios such as professional contexts within environmental science and policy-making, educational settings focusing on climate change, personal situations involving sustainable living, and specialized communities of climate researchers. Each of these contexts provides a unique lens through which to view the impact of CO2 doubling.\n\nFor resource investigation, I look into notable experts in climate science, such as those involved in IPCC reports, and essential terminology like \"climate sensitivity,\" \"forcings,\" and \"feedback mechanisms.\" Organizations like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are also key resources.\n\nCreating headlines for articles that address the query from multiple angles helps to further expand the query. Examples include \"CO2 Doubling: A Precise Look at Temperature Rise,\" \"Beyond CO2: Unpacking Other Drivers of Climate Change,\" and \"The Tipping Points: Understanding Critical Thresholds in Climate Change.\" These headlines not only provide a structure for exploring the topic but also help in extracting specific, high-value search terms.\n\nThrough this process, I extract terms such as \"CO2 concentration,\" \"temperature increase,\" \"greenhouse gases,\" \"feedback mechanisms,\" and \"climate sensitivity.\" These terms are crucial for understanding the nuanced effects of doubling CO2 concentration on global warming.\n\nAs I synthesize the information, applying the journalistic investigation technique has allowed me to move beyond the surface query to a deeper exploration of climate change dynamics. This approach has systematically uncovered related real-world terms and concepts, enhancing the original query with a richer understanding of the complex interactions influencing global warming.\n\nThe final step is to combine the original query intent with the valuable new terms discovered through this process. The augmented query becomes \"Understanding the precise temperature increase caused by doubling CO2 concentration while considering the influence of other forcings and feedback mechanisms on global warming, including the historical trend of CO2 concentration, the contribution of different greenhouse gases, key feedback mechanisms, and the projected impacts of a 2\u00b0C temperature increase.\"\n\nThis thought process demonstrates how the \"Query Expansion Through Journalistic Investigation\" technique can be applied to uncover a comprehensive set of terms and concepts related to a query, enhancing the search for information with a deeper understanding of the topic's complexity and real-world relevance.",
