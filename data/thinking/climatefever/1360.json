  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"In fact, the trend, while not statistically significant, is downward,\" this makes me think of various users who might be searching for insights on trends that aren't statistically significant. The user might actually be trying to understand what it means for a trend to be downward but not statistically significant, though they might not know the right terms to use. Initially, my thoughts are all over the place, wondering about the contexts where such a trend might be observed - in business sales data, climate change research, or even in social media engagement metrics.\n\nAs I start to approach this using the Query Expansion via User Intent and Journey Mapping technique, I realize the importance of creating distinct user personas. This involves understanding their levels of expertise, goals, and prior knowledge. For instance, Sarah, the student, would likely start with basic questions about statistical significance, while Dr. Anya Sharma, the environmental scientist, would be more concerned with the implications of non-significant trends in climate data analysis. By considering these personas, I can begin to identify the vocabulary and intent terms they would use at different stages of their information-seeking journey.\n\nFollowing the technique, I start with user persona creation. I need to consider how each persona would approach the topic, from the novice asking \"What does not statistically significant mean?\" to the expert looking into \"Limitations of significance testing trend analysis.\" This systematic approach helps me understand the diverse ways users might search for information related to downward trends that aren't statistically significant.\n\nAs I delve into search vocabulary analysis, I notice the range of terms that could be used, from simple queries like \"Trend but not significant\" to more complex ones such as \"statistical power trend analysis environmental science.\" These terms reflect not only the users' current understanding but also their goals - whether it's to explain a concept, identify reasons for a lack of significance, or explore alternative statistical tests.\n\nThe journey mapping stage allows me to see how users progress from initial awareness to expertise. For example, a student might start with \"What is statistical significance?\" and move on to \"Factors affecting statistical significance\" as they learn more. This progression helps me identify key terms and concepts that are relevant at each stage of the user's journey.\n\nContextual scenarios also play a crucial role. A business analyst explaining trends to stakeholders might use terms related to \"Downward trend not statistically significant sales,\" while a researcher investigating better statistical methods might focus on \"Bayesian approaches to trend analysis.\" These scenarios highlight the practical applications and decision-making contexts where understanding non-significant trends is critical.\n\nFinally, extracting intent-based terms from all personas and scenarios gives me a comprehensive list of keywords and phrases that reflect how real users would search for this information. Terms like \"lack of statistical power,\" \"type II error,\" \"effect size,\" and \"sample size\" emerge as crucial for capturing the essence of the query.\n\nThrough this process of applying the Query Expansion via User Intent and Journey Mapping technique and exploring related threads, I believe the terms identified in the augmented query - \"Downward trend not statistically significant causes explanations examples 'lack of statistical power' 'type II error' 'effect size' 'sample size' limitations\" - would be most effective for capturing both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking. This approach not only enhances the relevance of search results but also demonstrates how structured techniques can be enriched by natural cognitive patterns and insights.",
