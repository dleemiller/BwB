  "thought_process": "As I begin to expand the query \"local factors affecting sea level rise [city name] including geological and climate influences,\" my initial thoughts are about the diversity of users who might be searching for this information. I think about a concerned citizen who has noticed changes in their local coastline and wants to understand what's happening, versus a climate change researcher seeking detailed data on historical sea level trends. This contrast makes me realize the importance of considering various perspectives and expertise levels in query expansion.\n\nMy next step is to systematically apply the query expansion technique via user intent and journey mapping. I start by creating user personas: the novice concerned citizen, the intermediate local government official, the advanced coastal geologist, and the expert climate change researcher. Each persona has distinct goals, motivations, and prior knowledge that influence their search vocabulary and journey stages.\n\nFor the novice, I imagine search terms like \"sea level rising near me\" or \"coastal flooding causes,\" reflecting their initial concerns and lack of specialized vocabulary. In contrast, the expert climate change researcher might use terms like \"paleo sea level reconstructions\" or \"climate forcing on regional sea level trends,\" indicating a high level of specialization and a focus on detailed, scientific information.\n\nAs I analyze the search vocabulary across these personas, I notice patterns and differences that can inform our expanded query. The intermediate user, perhaps a local government official, might search for \"local sea level projections\" or \"tide gauge data [city name],\" showing a need for more specific, actionable information. The advanced user, a coastal geologist, would likely use terms like \"relative sea level change\" or \"isostatic adjustment,\" highlighting their interest in the geological aspects of sea level rise.\n\nI then consider the journey stages of these users, from entry-point questions about sea level rise basics to advanced inquiries into the causes and contributing factors of regional variations. This progression helps me identify key terms and concepts that are relevant at different stages of their information journey.\n\nMoving on to contextual scenarios, I envision situations where users need this information, such as evaluating flood risks, developing adaptation strategies, understanding ecosystem impacts, or conducting research on historical sea level changes. Each scenario suggests additional terms and phrases that users might employ in their searches, further enriching our query expansion.\n\nFinally, I extract intent-based terms from all personas and scenarios, focusing on high-value terms, contextual vocabulary, and intent-revealing terminology. This comprehensive approach ensures that our expanded query captures the diversity of user needs and search behaviors, enhancing the relevance and usefulness of search results for a wide range of users.\n\nThrough this structured yet intuitive process, I have generated a thought process that reflects how a search expert expands a query, balancing technique with natural cognitive patterns to create an authentic and effective search strategy.",
