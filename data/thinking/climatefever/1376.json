  "reasoning": "The query asks about periods within the last 10,000 years when the planet was significantly warmer than today. The existing results are weak because they either focus on events far outside this time frame (e.g., PETM) or are only tangentially related to the core concept of sustained warmth within the specified timeframe (e.g., January thaw, marine regression). To address this, I need to focus the query on the Holocene epoch (the last 11,700 years) and look for specific warm periods or events within it. Goal: Find evidence of sustained warmer periods within the Holocene.",

  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query about periods within the last 10,000 years when the planet was significantly warmer than today, this makes me think of various climate events and epochs, though the user might actually be trying to understand the fluctuations in global temperatures within a specific timeframe. Hmm, not sure yet how to capture the essence of sustained warmth versus transient events. \n\nTo tackle this, I'll approach it using the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal technique, which involves analyzing the query, constructing a conceptual graph, selecting expansion paths, extracting terms, and then filtering them based on relevance, distinctiveness, specificity, and searchability. This should help because it systematically breaks down the query into core concepts and relationships, allowing for a more nuanced understanding and expansion of the search terms.\n\nFollowing the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal approach, I should first identify the core concepts and entities in the original query. The key phrases here are \"warmer than today,\" \"past 10,000 years,\" and the implication of looking for sustained periods of warmth. The search intent seems informational, aiming to understand historical climate patterns. Implicit assumptions include focusing on global rather than regional warming and considering natural causes of climate variability.\n\nNext, constructing the conceptual graph: core nodes would include \"Holocene,\" \"global temperature,\" \"climate change,\" and \"warm periods.\" First-order connections involve the attributes of these concepts, such as the Holocene's time span, characteristics of global temperature anomalies, and types of climate change events. Second-order connections could involve related concepts like solar variability, volcanic eruptions, and orbital forcing, which influence climate patterns. Domain contexts include paleoclimatology and historical climatology.\n\nFor expansion path selection, I identify promising directions:\n- Synonymous terms for \"warm periods\" could include \"temperature anomalies\" or \"climate optima.\"\n- Hierarchical terms might involve broader concepts like \"climate epochs\" or narrower ones such as \"decadal variability.\"\n- Compositional terms could include components of the climate system affected by warmth, like \"sea-level rise\" or \"ice cap melting.\"\n- Contextual terms might involve settings where these warm periods are particularly relevant, such as \"agricultural impacts\" or \"coastal communities.\"\n- Domain-specific terminology could include terms like \"Holocene Climate Optimum,\" \"Medieval Warm Period,\" and \"Bond events.\"\n\nNow, extracting and filtering terms:\n- For synonymous terms, \"thermal maxima\" and \"climatic optimum\" are relevant and distinctive.\n- Hierarchically, \"Quaternary warm periods\" offers a broader view, while \"multidecadal variability\" narrows it down.\n- Compositionally, \"polar ice cap extent\" and \"glacial retreat\" are specific and searchable.\n- Contextually, \"permafrost thaw\" and \"methane release\" provide a scenario-based approach.\n- Domain-specific terms already identified include \"Holocene Climate Optimum\" and \"Medieval Warm Period.\"\n\nAfter filtering, the high-value expansion terms seem to capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of the query, enhancing the original search intent by providing alternative and more specific pathways for document retrieval.\n\nThrough this process of applying Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal and exploring related threads, I believe the final expanded terms would be effective for improving document retrieval. They capture the complexity of the user's query, aiming to identify sustained warmer periods within the last 10,000 years, their characteristics, and potential causes.",
