  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"Satellite temperature readings going back to 1979 show 1998 was by far the warmest year in the satellite era,\" this makes me think of climate change and global warming trends. Though the user might actually be trying to find specific data on temperature anomalies, I'm not sure yet how they intend to use this information. The query has a clear factual basis and a focus on scientific data, which suggests the user is looking for detailed, accurate information.\n\nTo expand this query effectively, I need to approach it using a structured technique. I'll utilize the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal method, which involves constructing a conceptual graph and traversing it to find high-value expansion terms. This should help because it allows for a systematic exploration of related concepts and terms that can enhance the query's specificity and relevance.\n\nFirst, I'll analyze the query. The core concepts here are \"satellite temperature readings,\" \"warmest year,\" and \"1979.\" The search intent appears to be informational, with the user seeking data on a specific aspect of climate change. There's an implicit assumption that the data is global, given the mention of satellite readings, but this needs clarification.\n\nNext, I'll construct the conceptual graph. The core nodes will be \"temperature,\" \"year,\" and \"satellite data.\" First-order connections include \"climate change,\" \"global warming,\" and \"weather patterns.\" Second-order connections might involve \"greenhouse gases,\" \"ocean currents,\" and \"atmospheric conditions.\" The domain context is clearly environmental science and climatology.\n\nFor expansion path selection, I identify several promising directions: \n- Synonymous terms, such as \"global warming\" for \"climate change,\"\n- Hierarchical terms, like \"average temperature\" for \"temperature readings,\"\n- Compositional terms, such as \"CO2 levels\" as a component of \"greenhouse gases,\"\n- Contextual terms, like \"El Ni\u00f1o\" as a scenario affecting global temperature,\n- Domain-specific terminology, such as \"teleconnections\" in climatology.\n\nFollowing the technique, I should first extract terms related to these paths and then filter them based on relevance, distinctiveness, specificity, and searchability. For synonymous terms, \"climate trends\" and \"global warming patterns\" could be useful. Hierarchical terms might include \"annual temperature averages\" and \"decadal climate variability.\" Compositional terms could involve \"atmospheric CO2 concentrations\" and \"methane levels.\" Contextual terms might include \"El Ni\u00f1o events\" and \"La Ni\u00f1a impacts.\" Domain-specific terms could be \"teleconnections in climate systems\" and \"ocean-atmosphere interactions.\"\n\nAs I apply this technique, I notice that the step involving hierarchical terms is revealing insights into how the user might be interested in not just the warmest year but also in understanding trends over time. This actually reminds me of the concept of \"climate variability,\" which might also be relevant. I need to consider the next step in the technique, which involves filtering these terms, but I'm also noticing an interesting pattern where terms related to specific climate phenomena, like \"El Ni\u00f1o,\" could provide valuable context to the query.\n\nApplying the specific aspect of the technique related to compositional terms leads me to discover \"greenhouse gas emissions\" as a relevant term, which connects to what we were exploring earlier regarding climate change. I just had a realization that connects to our discussion on domain-specific terminology; terms like \"climate model projections\" could offer a forward-looking perspective that complements historical temperature data.\n\nThrough this process of applying the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal technique and exploring related threads, I believe the following terms would be most effective for expanding the query: \"climate trends,\" \"global warming,\" \"annual temperature averages,\" \"atmospheric CO2 concentrations,\" \"El Ni\u00f1o events,\" \"teleconnections in climate systems,\" \"ocean-atmosphere interactions,\" \"greenhouse gas emissions,\" \"climate model projections,\" and \"decadal climate variability.\" These terms capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, enhancing the query's ability to retrieve relevant documents.\n\nThe original query was \"Satellite temperature readings going back to 1979 show 1998 was by far the warmest year in the satellite era.\" \nThe core concepts are \"temperature,\" \"satellite,\" \"1979,\" and \"warmest year.\"\nThe expansion paths selected were synonymous, hierarchical, compositional, contextual, and domain-specific terms.\nThe expanded terms are \"climate trends,\" \"global warming,\" \"annual temperature averages,\" \"atmospheric CO2 concentrations,\" \"El Ni\u00f1o events,\" \"teleconnections in climate systems,\" \"ocean-atmosphere interactions,\" \"greenhouse gas emissions,\" \"climate model projections,\" and \"decadal climate variability.\"\nThe augmented query, combining the original with the best expansion terms, could be \"",
