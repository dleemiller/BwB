{"reasoning": "The query \"Is obesity a disease?\" is a question seeking to understand the classification of obesity\u2014whether it should be considered a disease or not. The document types are debates, information sites, and news. The strengths are balanced perspectives even though the weaknesses included biases and credibility concerns.\n\nQuery Goals: The primary goal is to determine whether obesity is medically classified as a disease. Secondary goals include understanding the arguments for and against this classification, exploring the implications of each perspective, and identifying any associated medical terminologies or related conditions.\n\nNode Classes: I will define several node classes relevant to obesity and disease classification: (1) Medical Conditions, representing diseases, disorders, and syndromes; (2) Risk Factors, encompassing conditions or behaviors that increase the likelihood of disease; (3) Diagnostic Criteria, outlining the criteria used to identify a disease; (4) Healthcare Policy implications of classifying obesity as a disease; (5) Societal Perceptions and stigma surrounding obesity.\n\nQuery Nodes: The query nodes extracted directly from the query are \"Obesity\" and \"Disease\". These are the central entities in the question.\n\nNearest Neighbors: Hypothetical nearest neighbors for \"Obesity\" include \"Body Mass Index (BMI)\", \"Adiposity\", \"Metabolic Syndrome\", \"Type 2 Diabetes\", \"Cardiovascular Disease\",\"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease\". Nearest neighbors for \"Disease\" are \"Illness\", \"Medical Condition\", \"Disorder\", \"Syndrome\", \"Pathology\".\n\nAugmented Query: I can augment the original query by adding terms related to the medical and social implications of classifying obesity as a disease. This could involve exploring the diagnostic criteria, risk factors, and associated conditions, as well as the impact on healthcare policy and societal perceptions.", "query_goals": ["Determine the medical classification of obesity", "Understand arguments for and against obesity as a disease", "Explore the implications of each perspective", "Identify related medical terminologies and conditions", "Determine the criteria used to classify a condition as a disease"], "node_classes": ["Medical Conditions", "Risk Factors", "Diagnostic Criteria", "Healthcare Policy", "Societal Perceptions"], "query_nodes": ["Obesity", "Disease"], "nearest_neighbors": ["Body Mass Index (BMI)", "Adiposity", "Metabolic Syndrome", "Type 2 Diabetes", "Cardiovascular Disease", "Illness", "Medical Condition", "Disorder", "Syndrome", "Pathology", "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease"], "augmented_query": "\"Is obesity a disease?
