{"reasoning": "The query addresses the safety concerns regarding vaping. The current results are limited by biased opinions and lack of long-term research. Therefore, the focus will be to expand the search with terms related to the long-term health effects, specific chemicals involved in vaping, and alternative perspectives, such as studies on respiratory illnesses and cardiovascular impacts. I will identify and avoid overly general terms that might dilute the search. Then, I will broaden the search by adding terms that target specific health outcomes. I will select the most promising of these broader terms and delve deeper.", "query_goals": ["Identify long-term health consequences of vaping", "Investigate specific chemicals present in e-cigarette vapor and their effects", "Explore the impact of vaping on respiratory and cardiovascular health", "Investigate potential links between vaping and cancer", "Find research exploring vaping as a smoking cessation tool"], "ineffective_terms": ["safe", "is", "with"], "breadth_expansion": ["popcorn lung", "bronchiolitis obliterans", "acute lung injury", "myocardial infarction", "flavoring chemicals", "nicotine addiction", "propylene glycol", "vegetable glycerin", "secondhand vapor", "youth vaping", "gateway drug", "smoking cessation"], "depth_chain": ["youth vaping", "teen vaping trends", "e-cigarette marketing to teens", "youth nicotine dependence", "long-term effects of vaping on adolescent brains", "vaping prevention programs"], "augmented_query": "teen vaping trends e-cigarette marketing youth nicotine dependence adolescent brains vaping prevention popcorn lung acute lung injury myocardial infarction flavoring chemicals propylene glycol vegetable glycerin secondhand vapor gateway smoking cessation", "ndcg": {"NDCG@10": 0.93638, "NDCG@100": 0.96964, "NDCG@1000": 0.96964, "NDCG@10000": 0.96964}, "map": {"MAP@10": 0.75, "MAP@100": 0.89638, "MAP@1000": 0.89638, "MAP@10000": 0.89638}, "recall": {"Recall@10": 0.75, "Recall@100": 1.0, "Recall@1000": 1.0, "Recall@10000": 1.0}, "precision": {"P@10": 0.9, "P@100": 0.12, "P@1000": 0.012, "P@10000": 0.0012}, "delta": 0.06418999999999997, "instruction": "expand", "query": "Is vaping with e-cigarettes safe?", "query_id": "2", "dataset": "touche2020", "generator_model": "openrouter/google/gemini-2.0-flash-001", "temperature": 1.0}
