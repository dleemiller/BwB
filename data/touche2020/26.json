{"reasoning": "To approach the query as a knowledge cartographer, we must first establish the central point and scope of the inquiry. The question of whether standardized tests improve education is multifaceted, requiring consideration of various educational contexts, the purposes of testing, and the impacts on learning. The existing results provide a foundation by offering multiple perspectives and some research evidence, primarily within the US education system. However, to strengthen the inquiry, it's essential to expand the scope to include international perspectives, diverse educational settings, and a balanced view of the arguments for and against standardized testing. This expansion will involve mapping the conceptual territory to identify key landmarks, boundary areas, and detailed features that contribute to the debate on standardized testing and education.", "central_coordinates": ["Education Quality", "Standardized Testing", "Learning Outcomes"], "boundary_areas": ["Educational Policy", "Assessment Methods", "Teaching Practices", "Student Performance", "International Education Comparisons"], "key_landmarks": ["No Child Left Behind Act", "Common Core State Standards", "SAT and ACT Tests", "PISA Rankings", "Personalized Learning"], "detail_features": ["Test Preparation Strategies", "Curriculum Alignment", "Teacher Training Programs", "Technology-Enhanced Assessments", "Special Needs Accommodations", "Cultural Bias in Testing"], "navigation_terms": ["Validity", "Reliability", "Standardization", "Accountability", "Teaching to the Test", "High-Stakes Testing", "Formative Assessment", "Summative Assessment"], "augmented_query": "Do standardized tests improve education outcomes across different socio-economic and cultural contexts, and what are the implications of high-stakes testing on teaching practices and student learning experiences?", "ndcg": {"NDCG@10": 0.70197, "NDCG@100": 0.72674, "NDCG@1000": 0.77808, "NDCG@10000": 0.81227}, "map": {"MAP@10": 0.23406, "MAP@100": 0.46956, "MAP@1000": 0.48357, "MAP@10000": 0.48465}, "recall": {"Recall@10": 0.26087, "Recall@100": 0.73913, "Recall@1000": 0.86957, "Recall@10000": 1.0}, "precision": {"P@10": 0.6, "P@100": 0.17, "P@1000": 0.02, "P@10000": 0.0023}, "delta": 0.0642600000000001, "instruction": "cartography", "query": "Do standardized tests improve education?", "query_id": "26", "dataset": "touche2020", "generator_model": "openrouter/meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct", "temperature": 1.0}
