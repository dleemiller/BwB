{"reasoning": "The query revolves around the economic impact of Britain joining the Eurozone, particularly concerning job losses and inappropriate interest rates. To expand this search effectively, we need to consider various facets like historical context (ERM experience), statistical data on unemployment, comparative analysis with current UK policies, and expert opinions like Anthony Browne's work. Constructing a conceptual graph involves identifying core entities such as 'Britain', 'Eurozone', and 'jobs' while linking them through properties like 'economic impact', 'interest rates', and historical examples such as the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM). For expansion paths, we'll explore synonyms for core concepts, hierarchical terms that provide broader or narrower contexts, compositional elements like attributes of economic policies, contextual scenarios in which Britain might interact with the Eurozone, and domain-specific terminology relevant to economics and currency unions. The goal is to enhance the query by introducing precise yet distinct terms that capture both historical precedents and contemporary analyses.", "query_goals": ["Identify core concepts and entities related to economic impact of joining a currency union", "Determine the search intent: analyze potential job losses, interest rates, and historical context like ERM", "Uncover implicit assumptions such as the current economic state's comparability with historical examples", "Expand with terms that highlight both factual data and expert opinions"], "node_classes": ["Economic Entities (e.g., Britain, Eurozone)", "Conceptual Relations (e.g., interest rates, currency union impact)", "Historical Contexts (e.g., ERM, past economic conditions)", "Statistical Data (e.g., unemployment rates)", "Expert Opinions (e.g., analysis by Anthony Browne)"], "query_nodes": ["Britain", "Eurozone", "Jobs", "Unemployment Rates", "Interest Rates", "Exchange Rate Mechanism", "Anthony Browne"], "nearest_neighbors": ["Impact of single currency on employment in EU countries", "Historical consequences of monetary union decisions", "Economic effects of Eurozone membership for non-member states", "Interest rate policy differences within and outside the Eurozone", "Analysis of Eurozone's economic conditions affecting job markets"], "augmented_query": "For Britain to join the single currency is simply unthinkable; jobs will be lost.

After we joined the Exchange Rate Mechanism, 100,000 businesses went bankrupt and unemployment doubled before we were finally forced out in 1992.\" Repetition of this is to be avoided at all costs and by Britain staying out of the Euro.  1Browne, A., 2001, \"The Euro: Should Britain Join?\"", "query_id": "test-politics-cpegiepgh-con01a", "dataset": "arguana", "generator_model": "ollama_chat/phi4:14b-q8_0", "temperature": 1.0}
