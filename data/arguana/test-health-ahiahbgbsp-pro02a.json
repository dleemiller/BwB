{"reasoning": "The goal is to expand on the concept of reducing smoking through public bans by mapping out the broader conceptual territory. The central point revolves around \"reducing smoking rates\" using a \"ban in public places,\" focusing on both social and health aspects, as well as enforcement and cultural acceptance challenges. By identifying cardinal directions such as practical (enforcement issues) vs. theoretical (social norms), technical (implementation details) vs. social (cultural factors), the exploration can be appropriately scaled to include broader international perspectives while honing in on specific challenges faced by African countries at an early stage of a tobacco epidemic.
