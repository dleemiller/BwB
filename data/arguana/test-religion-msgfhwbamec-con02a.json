{"reasoning": "The query revolves around the potential negative consequences (resentment, targeting, increased tensions, fueling extremism) arising from banning arranged marriages, particularly within Euro-Asian communities. The core argument is that such bans, presented as secular liberalism, can be perceived as intolerance and counterproductive to integration. The existing search results, while related, focus more on veil bans and general Islamophobia, lacking specific insights into arranged marriages.

Arranged marriages are seen as a very important aspect of the identity of lots of Euro-Asian communities. At a time when tensions between non-Muslims and Muslims in Europe are high enough, for example there were protests in London against the film innocence of Muslims, [1] targeting a practice carried out by many Muslim families could help extremist tendencies to flare up. It is important not try and cloak laws that are little more than blind intolerance with terms that make them seem like secular liberalism. Attempting to ban practices like wearing the veil in the name of inclusion have been proven to only inflame tensions, not improve integration.
