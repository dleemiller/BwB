{"reasoning": "The original query addresses the influence of advertisements on children, fostering materialism and impacting societal values. This broad thematic concern connects with documents discussing advertising's psychological and social impacts, consumer culture, and materialism. The core concepts identified include 'advertising,' 'children,' 'materialism,' 'values,' and 'society.' The expansion paths chosen aim to explore synonymous terms like 'marketing' instead of 'advertising'; hierarchical terms like 'consumer behavior'; compositional terms such as 'impacts on mental health'; contextual terms involving 'educational settings'; and domain-specific terminology like 'media literacy.' By identifying high-value terms that extend these concepts, we enhance the search to capture a wider array of relevant documents without losing focus. Filtering ensured the relevance and specificity of these terms, ensuring they are distinct yet closely related to the query's intent.", "query_goals": ["Identify core concepts and entities in the original query", "Determine the search intent", "Explore potential implicit assumptions or constraints"], "node_classes": ["core_concepts", "first_order_connections", "second_order_connections", "domain_contexts"], "query_nodes": ["advertising", "children", "materialism", "values", "society"], "nearest_neighbors": ["marketing", "consumer behavior", "impacts on mental health", "educational settings", "media literacy", "consumer culture", "social psychology", "patience", "hard work", "moderation"], "augmented_query": "Advertisements influence children to desire material possessions, impacting societal values and fostering materialism.
