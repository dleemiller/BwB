{"reasoning": "The original query focuses on the affordability and access to generic drugs in Africa, highlighting economic conditions and specific examples like the cost disparity between patented and generic versions of Glivec. The intent appears informational, aiming to explore how affordable medications can improve health outcomes amid wealth inequality. Existing results emphasize various impacts of generics but lack depth regarding local production capacity, socioeconomic factors beyond drug pricing, and solutions for these challenges. To enhance this search query, a conceptual graph will be constructed with core concepts from the query at its center, branching out into relevant expansions that address identified weaknesses. The goal is to uncover high-value terms related to economic policies, healthcare infrastructure, and regional production capabilities. Through thoughtful expansion of the query via paths like hierarchical terms (e.g., broader economic implications), contextual terms (settings/scenarios impacting drug access), and domain-specific terminology (e.g., health policy in Africa), new angles will be explored to provide a more comprehensive understanding.", "query_goals": ["Understand the impact of generic drugs on healthcare affordability in Africa", "Explore socioeconomic factors affecting drug accessibility beyond pricing", "Identify local production capacity for generic medications within African countries"], "node_classes": ["Generic Drugs", "Economic Conditions", "Healthcare Access", "Regional Production", "Policy Solutions", "Wealth Distribution", "Market Dynamics", "Drug Safety and Efficacy", "Health Outcomes"], "query_nodes": ["Affordable drugs", "Generic drugs", "GDP growth in Africa", "Economic condition in Africa", "Glivec vs generic drug pricing"], "nearest_neighbors": ["Economic development policies in Africa", "Healthcare infrastructure improvements", "Local pharmaceutical manufacturing capabilities", "Distribution of wealth and economic inequality", "Generic drug production regulations", "Impact of affordable healthcare on mortality rates", "Role of international trade in generic drugs", "Public health policy interventions", "Collaborations for local drug production", "Market dynamics affecting drug pricing"], "augmented_query": "Easily affordable drugs mean greater access; Generic drugs are much cheaper to produce, ideal for Africa's struggling population.

Generic medication would reduce the price of these drugs, making them affordable to the average citizen.
