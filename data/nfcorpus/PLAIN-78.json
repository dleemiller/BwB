{"reasoning": "The query \"What Do Meat Purge and Cola Have in Common?\" is intriguing because it seeks a less obvious connection between two seemingly disparate things. The core intent is informational, aiming to uncover shared properties or effects. The weakness of current results lies in the absence of any direct comparison between the two. I will address this by expanding the query to focus on the chemical compositions, mechanisms of action within the body, and potential overlapping effects on health.", "query_goals": ["Identify shared chemical components between meat purge and cola.", "Explore overlapping health effects of meat purge and cola.", "Examine the impact of both on digestive processes.", "Determine if both contribute to similar nutritional deficiencies or excesses."], "node_classes": ["Chemical Composition", "Health Effects", "Digestive Processes", "Nutritional Impact", "Food Science", "Meat Science", "Beverage Science"], "query_nodes": ["Meat Purge", "Cola", "Chemicals", "Health", "Digestion", "Nutrition"], "nearest_neighbors": ["Myoglobin", "Blood", "Water", "Proteins", "Coca-Cola", "Phosphoric Acid", "Sugar", "Caffeine", "Acidosis", "Iron Absorption", "Denaturation", "Osmosis", "Muscle tissue", "Carbonation"], "augmented_query": "\"Meat purge composition OR exudate AND Cola composition AND shared health effects OR common chemical components OR impact on iron absorption OR muscle protein denaturation\"", "ndcg": {"NDCG@10": 0.33014, "NDCG@100": 0.16025, "NDCG@1000": 0.36396, "NDCG@10000": 0.53561}, "map": {"MAP@10": 0.02688, "MAP@100": 0.03493, "MAP@1000": 0.05243, "MAP@10000": 0.06361}, "recall": {"Recall@10": 0.03226, "Recall@100": 0.1129, "Recall@1000": 0.54839, "Recall@10000": 1.0}, "precision": {"P@10": 0.2, "P@100": 0.07, "P@1000": 0.034, "P@10000": 0.0062}, "delta": 0.062090000000000034, "instruction": "graph", "query": "What Do Meat Purge and Cola Have in Common?", "query_id": "PLAIN-78", "dataset": "nfcorpus", "generator_model": "openrouter/google/gemini-2.0-flash-001", "temperature": 1.0}
