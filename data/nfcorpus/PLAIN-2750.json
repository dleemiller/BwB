{"reasoning": "To understand the temporal evolution of using probiotics for preventing the common cold, I'll investigate its origins, key studies demonstrating efficacy, current usage, and potential future applications. This exploration will identify terms representing the topic's evolution. The search results are primarily from scientific studies which gives strong confidence in the evidence-based recommendations.
