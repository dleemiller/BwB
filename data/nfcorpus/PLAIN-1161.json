{"reasoning": "To expand the query \"fava beans,\" we need to understand how different user personas might search for information across their journey from awareness to expertise. The challenge is to connect broader health, nutritional, or agricultural studies to fava beans due to current gaps in specificity. We'll leverage varying expertise levels and scenarios where users might seek out this information.\n\nThe existing documents cover observational studies, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and randomized controlled trials but do not address fava beans directly. The strengths include comprehensive methodologies and large sample sizes (particularly in systematic reviews), whereas weaknesses lie in the lack of direct relevance to fava beans and limited population generalizability. By exploring user personas with varying needs and vocabularies, we can identify potential connections between existing document themes (such as health benefits or nutritional content) and the specific context of fava beans.", "user_personas": ["Alice - Novice home gardener interested in starting a vegetable garden; seeks basic information about growing fava beans.", "Bob - Intermediate nutritionist looking for dietary studies related to legumes, including fava beans.", "Carol - Advanced agricultural scientist researching the impact of different legumes on soil health and sustainability.", "Dave - Expert dietitian analyzing comprehensive data sets for specific nutritional profiles of various legumes like fava beans."], "search_vocabulary": ["how to grow fava beans at home", "health benefits of eating fava beans", "legume nutritional studies", "soil health impact from growing fava beans", "fava bean growth cycle", "comparing legumes for diet plans", "agricultural sustainability and legumes", "detailed nutrient profile of fava beans"], "journey_stages": ["What are the basic requirements to grow fava beans?", "How do fava beans contribute to a healthy diet?", "What role do legumes play in agricultural practices?", "Which legumes offer the best nutritional value, and how does fava fit into this?"], "usage_scenarios": ["Alice needs guidance on planting and caring for fava beans as part of her home gardening project.", "Bob is preparing a report on the dietary impact of various legumes for a health clinic's new menu planning initiative.", "Carol is conducting field research to evaluate how different legume crops affect soil quality over several growing seasons.", "Dave is developing a comprehensive guide comparing the nutritional benefits of fava beans against other legumes for clients with specific dietary needs."], "intent_terms": ["fava bean planting guide", "nutritional content of legumes", "soil enhancement through legume crops", "legume diet comparison", "benefits of growing fava beans"], "augmented_query": "\"fava beans growth requirements, health benefits, nutritional studies, soil impact, agricultural sustainability, nutrient profile comparison\"", "ndcg": {"NDCG@10": 0.0, "NDCG@100": 0.16667, "NDCG@1000": 0.16667, "NDCG@10000": 0.16667}, "map": {"MAP@10": 0.0, "MAP@100": 0.01587, "MAP@1000": 0.01587, "MAP@10000": 0.01587}, "recall": {"Recall@10": 0.0, "Recall@100": 1.0, "Recall@1000": 1.0, "Recall@10000": 1.0}, "precision": {"P@10": 0.0, "P@100": 0.01, "P@1000": 0.001, "P@10000": 0.0001}, "delta": 0.06497000000000001, "instruction": "journey", "query": "fava beans", "query_id": "PLAIN-1161", "dataset": "nfcorpus", "generator_model": "ollama_chat/phi4:14b-q8_0", "temperature": 1.0}
