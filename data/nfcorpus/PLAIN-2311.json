{"reasoning": "The query on \"veal\" relates to scientific literature encompassing health, nutrition, environmental impact, and dietary components. Although veal is occasionally mentioned in broader discussions about meat or specific nutrients like phosphorus, direct insights are sparse. The documents' strengths lie in their high-quality analysis of related fields but lack focused content on veal specifically. To improve the search, it's crucial to explore historical developments concerning veal production and consumption, key milestones impacting its dietary role, current perceptions and practices around veal in various domains, as well as future trends that may influence this area. By identifying terms across these dimensions, we can augment the query to encompass a more comprehensive view of veal within scientific discourse.", "historical_foundation": ["Origin of livestock farming", "Ancient meat consumption practices", "Introduction of veal production in European agriculture", "Vegetarian and animal welfare movements impacting veal production"], "development_milestones": ["Regulations on veal crate systems introduced", "Emergence of organic and free-range veal farming", "Nutritional studies highlighting veal's protein and mineral content", "Shifts in dietary guidelines reflecting reduced red meat consumption, affecting veal demand"], "current_landscape": ["Sustainability concerns in veal production", "Technological advances in livestock management impacting veal yield", "Health impacts of red versus white meats including veal", "Market trends showing consumer preference shifts towards plant-based alternatives or ethically sourced meat"], "emerging_trends": ["Growth of lab-grown meat as an alternative to traditional veal", "Innovations in feed and farming practices aimed at reducing environmental footprint", "Increasing regulatory scrutiny on animal welfare standards", "Integration of precision agriculture in veal production for efficiency"], "temporal_terms": ["Livestock farming", "Red meat consumption", "Veal crate regulation", "Organic veal", "Nutritional profile", "Dietary guidelines evolution", "Sustainable agriculture", "Lab-grown meat", "Animal welfare standards", "Precision agriculture"], "augmented_query": "\"veal in environmental health, sustainable farming practices, nutritional studies on red vs. white meats, historical animal welfare regulations, current market trends and consumer preferences regarding veal consumption, technological innovations in livestock production, emerging alternatives like lab-grown meat\"", "ndcg": {"NDCG@10": 0.0, "NDCG@100": 0.15694, "NDCG@1000": 0.24176, "NDCG@10000": 0.24176}, "map": {"MAP@10": 0.0, "MAP@100": 0.03571, "MAP@1000": 0.04243, "MAP@10000": 0.04243}, "recall": {"Recall@10": 0.0, "Recall@100": 0.5, "Recall@1000": 1.0, "Recall@10000": 1.0}, "precision": {"P@10": 0.0, "P@100": 0.01, "P@1000": 0.002, "P@10000": 0.0002}, "delta": 0.11141999999999999, "instruction": "timetravel", "query": "veal", "query_id": "PLAIN-2311", "dataset": "nfcorpus", "generator_model": "ollama_chat/phi4:14b-q8_0", "temperature": 1.0}
