{"reasoning": "The original query \"Out of the Lab Onto the Track\" suggests an interest in applying scientific research findings from lab settings to real-world athletic performance, specifically focusing on methods such as tear fluid osmolarity to monitor athlete hydration. The document strengths indicate a successful link between laboratory research and practical sports medicine applications, while weaknesses highlight off-topic documents centered on general health or unrelated corporate benefits.\n\nTo expand this query, we can map out how different user personas might express their search needs based on varying expertise levels and scenarios in which they seek information. We'll create distinct personas to identify differences in vocabulary, learning journeys, contexts, and intents associated with the topic of translating lab research to athletic settings. This approach will generate a comprehensive augmented query that better aligns with users' diverse searching behaviors.", "user_personas": ["Novice Athlete: An amateur athlete seeking basic understanding of hydration strategies for improved performance.", "Intermediate Coach: A coach looking for practical methods and tools to monitor athletes' hydration during training sessions.", "Advanced Sports Scientist: A researcher exploring novel, non-invasive techniques like tear fluid osmolarity in sports science.", "Expert Athletic Trainer: An expert focused on integrating cutting-edge scientific findings into athlete conditioning programs."], "search_vocabulary": ["hydration strategies for athletes", "non-invasive hydration monitoring", "tear fluid osmolarity technique", "sports performance and hydration", "monitoring athlete health in real-time", "practical applications of tear fluid studies", "research on athlete sweat loss measurement", "using tear fluid osmolarity for dehydration assessment"], "journey_stages": ["Introduction to hydration importance in sports", "Understanding basic hydration monitoring techniques", "Exploring non-invasive methods like tear fluid osmolarity", "Learning advanced applications of research findings in athletic settings", "Integrating scientific methods into professional training regimes"], "usage_scenarios": ["A beginner athlete seeks tips for staying hydrated during a marathon.", "A coach investigates new technologies to keep track of athletes' hydration levels efficiently.", "A sports scientist looks for case studies demonstrating tear fluid osmolarity in action.", "An athletic trainer integrates findings from recent research into team practices."], "intent_terms": ["hydration strategies", "non-invasive monitoring", "tear fluid osmolarity method", "athletic performance improvement", "real-world application of lab results", "novel hydration techniques in sports"], "augmented_query": "\"applying tear fluid osmolarity research to track athlete hydration non-invasive methods for improving athletic performance real-time monitoring of athletes' hydration during training and competitions integration of laboratory findings into sports science practical use of non-invasive hydration strategies\"", "ndcg": {"NDCG@10": 0.0, "NDCG@100": 0.0, "NDCG@1000": 0.13791, "NDCG@10000": 0.17468}, "map": {"MAP@10": 0.0, "MAP@100": 0.0, "MAP@1000": 0.00365, "MAP@10000": 0.00429}, "recall": {"Recall@10": 0.0, "Recall@100": 0.0, "Recall@1000": 0.75, "Recall@10000": 1.0}, "precision": {"P@10": 0.0, "P@100": 0.0, "P@1000": 0.003, "P@10000": 0.0004}, "delta": 0.01408000000000001, "instruction": "journey", "query": "Out of the Lab Onto the Track", "query_id": "PLAIN-3037", "dataset": "nfcorpus", "generator_model": "ollama_chat/phi4:14b-q8_0", "temperature": 1.0}
