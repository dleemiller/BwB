{"reasoning": "The query \"Meat & Multiple Myeloma\" suggests an investigation into potential links between dietary habits, specifically meat consumption, and the incidence or progression of multiple myeloma, a type of blood cancer. The central coordinates need to encompass both medical knowledge about multiple myeloma (disease etiology, risk factors, pathology) and nutritional science relating to meat consumption. Given that research documents are mainly in the form of abstracts and study summaries from epidemiological studies and research articles, the exploration will likely focus on identifying patterns of association or causal links while recognizing methodological limitations highlighted as strengths and weaknesses.", "central_coordinates": ["Multiple Myeloma (medical condition)", "Dietary Habits", "Meat Consumption", "Cancer Epidemiology"], "boundary_areas": ["Nutritional Science", "Oncology", "Epidemiology", "Public Health Nutrition", "Biochemistry of Diet and Disease"], "key_landmarks": ["Dietary Risk Factors for Cancer", "Pathophysiology of Multiple Myeloma", "Types of Meat (red, white, processed)", "Statistical Methods in Epidemiology", "Nutritional Interventions in Oncology"], "detail_features": ["Hazard Ratios and Odds Ratios in Studies", "Specific Nutrients or Compounds in Meat", "Mechanisms of Cancer Initiation and Progression", "Recall Bias in Dietary Self-Reports", "Multicenter Study Designs"], "navigation_terms": ["Multiple Myeloma Pathogenesis", "Meat Consumption Patterns", "Prospective Cohort Studies", "Hazard Ratio Interpretation", "Dietary Recall Bias", "Epidemiological Confounding Factors", "Nutritional Epidemiology"], "augmented_query": "\"Meat consumption impact on multiple myeloma incidence, prospective cohort studies, hazard ratios, meat types and cancer risk factors\"", "ndcg": {"NDCG@10": 0.0, "NDCG@100": 0.24667, "NDCG@1000": 0.31802, "NDCG@10000": 0.34127}, "map": {"MAP@10": 0.0, "MAP@100": 0.04311, "MAP@1000": 0.05508, "MAP@10000": 0.05561}, "recall": {"Recall@10": 0.0, "Recall@100": 0.625, "Recall@1000": 0.875, "Recall@10000": 1.0}, "precision": {"P@10": 0.0, "P@100": 0.05, "P@1000": 0.007, "P@10000": 0.0008}, "delta": 0.05607000000000001, "instruction": "cartography", "query": "Meat & Multiple Myeloma", "query_id": "PLAIN-3231", "dataset": "nfcorpus", "generator_model": "ollama_chat/phi4:14b-q8_0", "temperature": 1.0}
