{"reasoning": "The search results currently lean heavily toward scientific literature, which is great for experts but excludes other users. By identifying user personas with varying levels of expertise and mapping their information needs throughout their journey, I can identify important terms and concepts to augment the original query and create a more comprehensive and accessible search result set.
