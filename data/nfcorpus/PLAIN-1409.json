{"reasoning": "The original query 'industrial toxins' aims to explore the effects, mechanisms, and regulatory aspects of synthetic chemicals produced by industrial activities. The current results skew towards natural marine toxins such as ciguatera fish toxin, indicating a gap in coverage regarding man-made pollutants from industries like manufacturing or mining. To address these gaps, we need terms that explicitly refer to human-made environmental contaminants. Effective augmentation should introduce concepts specific to chemical engineering, toxicology of synthetic compounds, and regulatory frameworks for controlling industrial emissions.", "query_goals": ["Explore synthetic chemicals associated with industrial processes", "Highlight health impacts and biological studies related to man-made toxins", "Incorporate discussions on regulatory measures and mitigation strategies concerning industrial pollution"], "ineffective_terms": ["natural toxins", "marine biology", "ciguatera fish toxin"], "breadth_expansion": ["synthetic chemicals", "heavy metals contamination", "persistent organic pollutants", "industrial pollution regulation", "airborne industrial contaminants", "environmental risk assessment", "chemical engineering by-products", "toxicology of synthetic compounds"], "depth_chain": ["heavy metals contamination", "lead exposure", "cadmium toxicity", "arsenic pollution", "mercury poisoning"], "augmented_query": "heavy metals contamination lead exposure cadmium toxicity arsenic pollution mercury poisoning industrial pollution regulation chemical engineering by-products toxicology of synthetic compounds environmental risk assessment airborne industrial contaminants persistent organic pollutants", "ndcg": {"NDCG@10": 0.38824, "NDCG@100": 0.18149, "NDCG@1000": 0.48385, "NDCG@10000": 0.71544}, "map": {"MAP@10": 0.00762, "MAP@100": 0.01581, "MAP@1000": 0.13564, "MAP@10000": 0.17877}, "recall": {"Recall@10": 0.01186, "Recall@100": 0.05534, "Recall@1000": 0.58498, "Recall@10000": 1.0}, "precision": {"P@10": 0.3, "P@100": 0.14, "P@1000": 0.148, "P@10000": 0.0253}, "delta": 0.09043000000000001, "instruction": "expand", "query": "industrial toxins", "query_id": "PLAIN-1409", "dataset": "nfcorpus", "generator_model": "ollama_chat/phi4:14b-q8_0", "temperature": 1.0}
