{"reasoning": "The initial search failed to retrieve relevant results. Therefore, I'll re-interpret the query \"airport scanners\" as a topic for knowledge mapping. This will involve:\n\n1.  **Central Coordinates:** Defining the core concept and axes of exploration (technology vs. privacy, security vs. health).\n2.  **Boundary Exploration:** Identifying related fields like security protocols, materials science (scanner technology), privacy law, and health physics (radiation exposure).\n3.  **Landmark Identification:** Pinpointing key technologies (e.g., millimeter wave scanners, backscatter X-ray), legislation (e.g., TSA regulations), and ethical debates.\n4.  **Detail Mapping:** Looking into the specifics of image processing, vulnerability assessments, and the effectiveness of different scanning methods.\n5.  **Cartographic Legend:** Creating a glossary of important terms for navigating the subject.\n6.  **Augmented Query:** Expanding search terms to include synonyms, related technologies, and specific concerns.", "central_coordinates": ["Airport Security Screening", "Technology vs. Privacy", "Security Effectiveness vs. Health Risks", "Policy and Public Perception"], "boundary_areas": ["Transportation Security", "Medical Imaging", "Radiation Safety", "Materials Science", "Privacy Law", "Civil Liberties"], "key_landmarks": ["Millimeter Wave Scanners", "Backscatter X-ray Scanners", "Metal Detectors", "TSA Regulations", "Body Image Controversy", "Privacy Act", "Fourth Amendment", "Enhanced Pat-Down Procedures"], "detail_features": ["Image Processing Algorithms", "Threat Detection Rates", "False Alarm Rates", "Radiation Dosage Levels", "Health Risk Assessments", "Vulnerability Assessments (Software and Hardware)", "Behavioral Detection Techniques", "Facial Recognition Technology", "Automatic Target Recognition (ATR)"], "navigation_terms": ["Advanced Imaging Technology (AIT)", "Whole Body Imaging", "Radiation Exposure", "False Positives", "Privacy Invasion", "Security Theater", "TSA PreCheck", "Known Shipper Program", "Checked Baggage Screening"], "augmented_query": "airport security screening technology privacy \"millimeter wave\" \"backscatter x-ray\" radiation health risks \"TSA regulations\" \"body image\" \"false positives\" security effectiveness", "ndcg": {"NDCG@10": 0.22485, "NDCG@100": 0.35741, "NDCG@1000": 0.42301, "NDCG@10000": 0.42301}, "map": {"MAP@10": 0.08889, "MAP@100": 0.14042, "MAP@1000": 0.14347, "MAP@10000": 0.14347}, "recall": {"Recall@10": 0.33333, "Recall@100": 0.66667, "Recall@1000": 1.0, "Recall@10000": 1.0}, "precision": {"P@10": 0.2, "P@100": 0.04, "P@1000": 0.006, "P@10000": 0.0006}, "delta": 0.2479, "instruction": "cartography", "query": "airport scanners", "query_id": "PLAIN-510", "dataset": "nfcorpus", "generator_model": "openrouter/google/gemini-2.0-flash-001", "temperature": 1.0}
