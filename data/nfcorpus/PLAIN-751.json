{"reasoning": "The original query 'BRCA genes' is too broad. It needs to be refined to reflect the user's intent, which might involve testing, family history, personal risk, treatment options, or understanding the basics of the genes. The question variations capture common ways people inquire about personal health matters. The underlying motivations identify emotional and practical needs associated with the query. The valuable responses aim for expert guidance with personal experiences, detailed context, and caveats. Interaction patterns show natural follow-up questions and points of clarification. QA terminology extracts informal, patient-centered language. Finally, the augmented query adds important context to the search phrase.", "question_variations": ["What are the chances I have a BRCA mutation?", "How is BRCA testing done?", "What does a positive BRCA test mean for me?", "How can I lower my risk if I have a BRCA mutation?", "Has anyone gone through preventative surgery after BRCA testing?
