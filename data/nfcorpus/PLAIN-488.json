{"reasoning": "The existing documents focus primarily on the scientific understanding of Adenovirus 36 (Ad-36) concerning obesity, offering robust insights into its epidemiology, mechanisms of action, and empirical studies. The strengths lie in their detailed exploration of how Ad-36 might influence adipogenesis and its correlations with obesity across different populations. However, weaknesses include a narrow focus on the virological and microbiological aspects without delving into broader implications like public health strategies or socio-economic impacts.\n\nTo augment the query, it's crucial to expand beyond these confines and consider interdisciplinary insights that can provide a more holistic view of Ad-36 related obesity. This involves integrating knowledge from fields such as public health policy, societal impact analysis, economic considerations of healthcare costs associated with obesity, and preventive strategies. By mapping out this broader landscape, we ensure the search encompasses both scientific evidence and practical implications.", "central_coordinates": ["Adenovirus 36 (Ad-36) role in obesity", "Mechanisms of adipogenesis due to Ad-36", "Epidemiological studies on Ad-36 and obesity"], "boundary_areas": ["Public health implications of Ad-36 related obesity", "Socio-economic impact of obesity caused by viral infections", "Preventive strategies against Ad-36 transmission", "Virology vs. public health approach to Ad-36 research", "Policy making in relation to viral contributions to obesity"], "key_landmarks": ["Adenovirus 36 as an epidemiological factor", "Mechanisms of action leading to adipogenesis", "Clinical trials and studies on Ad-36 intervention", "Public health strategies addressing viral obesity factors", "Economic burden of obesity linked with infections"], "detail_features": ["Pathophysiological pathways influenced by Ad-36 in host cells", "Demographic data from epidemiological studies linking Ad-36 to obesity", "Cost analysis reports on obesity management in the context of viral causes", "Public health campaigns targeting prevention of viral infections like Ad-36"], "navigation_terms": ["Adenovirus 36 transmission methods", "Obesity prevention policies and programs", "Healthcare costs associated with viral-induced obesity", "Societal impact studies on infection-related weight gain", "Interdisciplinary research approaches to understanding Ad-36 effects"], "augmented_query": "\"Adenovirus 36 (Ad-36) role in obesity, public health implications of Ad-36 related obesity, socio-economic impacts of viral-induced obesity, preventive strategies against Ad-36 transmission, interdisciplinary studies combining virology and public health on Ad-36\"", "ndcg": {"NDCG@10": 0.90521, "NDCG@100": 0.79539, "NDCG@1000": 0.85725, "NDCG@10000": 0.87283}, "map": {"MAP@10": 0.54362, "MAP@100": 0.66534, "MAP@1000": 0.67424, "MAP@10000": 0.67474}, "recall": {"Recall@10": 0.6, "Recall@100": 0.73333, "Recall@1000": 0.93333, "Recall@10000": 1.0}, "precision": {"P@10": 0.9, "P@100": 0.11, "P@1000": 0.014, "P@10000": 0.0015}, "delta": 0.042849999999999944, "instruction": "cartography", "query": "adenovirus 36", "query_id": "PLAIN-488", "dataset": "nfcorpus", "generator_model": "ollama_chat/phi4:14b-q8_0", "temperature": 1.0}
