{"reasoning": "The query \"How Should I Take Probiotics?\" is best addressed by creating a conceptual map that spans from general usage guidelines to specific considerations based on individual needs and probiotic types. The center lies in the basic recommendations for taking probiotics. The map's boundaries extend to related health domains, such as gut health, immune function, and specific conditions treated with probiotics. Key landmarks include different probiotic strains, delivery systems, and timing strategies. Finer details involve considerations such as potential side effects, interactions with medications, and evaluating product quality. The augmented query should include these aspects to cover a broad range of user needs.", "central_coordinates": ["General recommendations for probiotic consumption", "Timing relative to meals (before, with, or after)", "Dosage guidelines", "Storage instructions", "Consideration of individual health status"], "boundary_areas": ["Gut health and microbiome", "Immune system function", "Digestive disorders (IBS, IBD)", "Antibiotic use and recovery", "Nutrient absorption", "Food sensitivities and allergies", "Mental health (gut-brain axis)"], "key_landmarks": ["Specific probiotic strains (Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Saccharomyces)", "Different probiotic delivery systems (capsules, powders, yogurts, fermented foods)", "Prebiotics (foods that feed probiotics)", "Considerations for Age: Infants vs. Adults", "Probiotics for Women's Health", "Probiotics for travelers", "Shelf stable probiotics"], "detail_features": ["Potential side effects (bloating, gas)", "Interactions with medications (antibiotics)", "Evaluating product quality (CFU count, expiration date, third-party testing)", "Importance of strain diversity", "Delayed-release capsules", "Enteric coating", "Consideration of specific health conditions (SIBO, yeast overgrowth, leaky gut)", "Dietary factors influencing probiotic efficacy", "The impact of stomach acid"], "navigation_terms": ["CFU (Colony Forming Units)", "Lactobacillus", "Bifidobacterium", "Prebiotics", "Gut Microbiome", "Strain Specificity", "Probiotic Supplement", "Food Sources", "Side Effects", "Dosage", "Storage", "Timing"], "augmented_query": "\"Probiotic dosage timing side effects\", \"Probiotic strains for specific conditions\", \"Probiotic CFU counts\", \"Probiotic storage\", \"Probiotics prebiotics combination\", \"Probiotics with meals vs empty stomach\", \"Probiotic supplement types\", \"Probiotics safety\", \"Probiotics for gut health\", \"Probiotics and antibiotics\", \"Probiotics brands review\"", "ndcg": {"NDCG@10": 0.91486, "NDCG@100": 0.50733, "NDCG@1000": 0.59806, "NDCG@10000": 0.73265}, "map": {"MAP@10": 0.17775, "MAP@100": 0.29485, "MAP@1000": 0.30661, "MAP@10000": 0.31471}, "recall": {"Recall@10": 0.19149, "Recall@100": 0.40426, "Recall@1000": 0.61702, "Recall@10000": 1.0}, "precision": {"P@10": 0.9, "P@100": 0.19, "P@1000": 0.029, "P@10000": 0.0047}, "delta": 0.02944000000000002, "instruction": "cartography", "query": "How Should I Take Probiotics?", "query_id": "PLAIN-153", "dataset": "nfcorpus", "generator_model": "openrouter/google/gemini-2.0-flash-001", "temperature": 1.0}
