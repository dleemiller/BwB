{"reasoning": "The original query 'Healthy Chocolate Milkshakes' aims to explore scientific research articles or study reports focused on chocolate milkshakes with health benefits. The strengths of existing results highlight detailed data and broad product analysis but also show weaknesses like possible causality limitations, lack of methodological clarity, and potential selection bias towards top-selling products. To enhance the query, we need to shift focus from 'top-selling' attributes, which may carry inherent biases, to specific health benefits or alternative ingredients that align with scientifically validated health impacts. This involves expanding the query terms conceptually while avoiding broad, non-specific terms and introducing depth into specific scientific aspects such as nutritional components.", "query_goals": ["Identify research focusing on the nutritional profile of chocolate milkshakes", "Explore studies about alternative sweeteners or ingredients for enhancing health benefits", "Investigate links between chocolate milkshakes and specific health outcomes (e.g., blood sugar levels, cholesterol)", "Understand methodological rigor in existing studies to evaluate causality better"], "ineffective_terms": ["top-selling", "popular products", "market trends"], "breadth_expansion": ["nutritional value", "alternative sweeteners (e.g., stevia, agave)", "antioxidants in chocolate", "benefits of dark chocolate", "protein content"], "depth_chain": ["antioxidants in chocolate", "flavanols and catechins", "anti-inflammatory properties", "cardiovascular benefits", "blood pressure regulation"], "augmented_query": "flavanols catechins cardiovascular benefits blood pressure dark chocolate health antioxidants anti-inflammatory properties", "ndcg": {"NDCG@10": 0.36211, "NDCG@100": 0.28693, "NDCG@1000": 0.50531, "NDCG@10000": 0.57719}, "map": {"MAP@10": 0.03889, "MAP@100": 0.08492, "MAP@1000": 0.11051, "MAP@10000": 0.11475}, "recall": {"Recall@10": 0.07143, "Recall@100": 0.2619, "Recall@1000": 0.78571, "Recall@10000": 1.0}, "precision": {"P@10": 0.3, "P@100": 0.11, "P@1000": 0.033, "P@10000": 0.0042}, "delta": 0.08413999999999999, "instruction": "expand", "query": "Healthy Chocolate Milkshakes", "query_id": "PLAIN-3432", "dataset": "nfcorpus", "generator_model": "ollama_chat/phi4:14b-q8_0", "temperature": 1.0}
