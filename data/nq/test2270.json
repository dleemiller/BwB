{"reasoning": "The query \"who was the highest ranking official in the early Christian Church?\" aims to identify an authoritative figure or title that represented supreme leadership within the nascent organizational structure of Christianity. The primary challenges in existing documents are the lack of explicit identification of a singular highest-ranking office and unrelated information mixing with relevant content.\n\nTo effectively enhance this query, it's essential to understand core concepts related to early Christian ecclesiastical hierarchy, significant historical figures, and titles used during that period. A conceptual graph should be constructed to explore these aspects thoroughly, including:\n\n- Core entities such as key early Church leaders (e.g., Peter) or recognized offices.\n- Hierarchical connections exploring broader/narrower church roles.\n- Compositional insights into the functions associated with leadership roles.\n\nBy expanding along identified pathways like synonymous terms, hierarchical concepts, and domain-specific terminology, we can derive semantically rich expansion terms that will aid in retrieving more precise documents about early Church leadership. Filtering these terms for relevance, specificity, and searchability ensures the augmented query maintains original intent while providing new retrieval opportunities.", "query_goals": ["Identify the highest-ranking official title or figure in the early Christian Church.", "Understand the hierarchical structure of early Christian ecclesiastical offices.", "Distinguish relevant religious historical content from unrelated political information."], "node_classes": ["Key Figures", "Ecclesiastical Roles", "Historical Context", "Religious Titles", "Church Hierarchy"], "query_nodes": ["highest ranking official", "early Christian Church", "Peter", "Paul", "bishops", "elders", "apostles"], "nearest_neighbors": ["Patriarch of Alexandria", "Archbishop of Constantinople", "Bishop of Rome (Pope)", "Elder", "Deacon", "Apostle Peter", "Council of Nicaea", "Coptic Orthodox Church"], "augmented_query": "\"highest ranking official early Christian Church, Pope, Bishop of Rome, Patriarch, Council of Nicaea, ecclesiastical hierarchy, bishops, apostles, elders\"", "ndcg": {"NDCG@10": 0.0, "NDCG@100": 0.25596, "NDCG@1000": 0.25596, "NDCG@10000": 0.25596}, "map": {"MAP@10": 0.0, "MAP@100": 0.07143, "MAP@1000": 0.07143, "MAP@10000": 0.07143}, "recall": {"Recall@10": 0.0, "Recall@100": 1.0, "Recall@1000": 1.0, "Recall@10000": 1.0}, "precision": {"P@10": 0.0, "P@100": 0.01, "P@1000": 0.001, "P@10000": 0.0001}, "delta": 0.11835000000000001, "instruction": "graph", "query": "who was the highest ranking official in the early christian church", "query_id": "test2270", "dataset": "nq", "generator_model": "ollama_chat/phi4:14b-q8_0", "temperature": 1.0}
