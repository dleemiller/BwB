{"reasoning": "The original query, 'what is the difference between ron and mon,' seems to aim at understanding differences specifically related to RON and MON in the context of fuel ratings. The search results include irrelevant information concerning cultural references like TV series characters or historical peoples that do not contribute to answering this specific technical question about octane numbers. Thus, a refinement strategy is required to focus on relevant domains such as automotive engineering or chemical properties of fuels while excluding unrelated contexts. By applying augmentation techniques and identifying ineffective terms from the existing results, we can enhance the search query for more targeted and relevant outcomes.", "query_goals": ["Clarify and target the query towards the technical understanding of RON (Research Octane Number) and MON (Motor Octane Number) in automotive fuels.", "Eliminate irrelevant contexts like cultural or historical references from the query results."], "ineffective_terms": ["Ron (TV series character)", "Mon (French military rank)", "Mon people"], "breadth_expansion": ["fuel ratings", "automotive engines", "internal combustion engine performance", "fuel quality assessment", "engine knocking prevention"], "depth_chain": ["engine knocking prevention", "pre-ignition in engines", "anti-knock agents", "tetraethyl lead", "MTBE (Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether)"], "augmented_query": "engine knocking prevention anti-knock agents tetraethyl lead MTBE fuel quality assessment internal combustion engine performance", "ndcg": {"NDCG@10": 1.0, "NDCG@100": 1.0, "NDCG@1000": 1.0, "NDCG@10000": 1.0}, "map": {"MAP@10": 1.0, "MAP@100": 1.0, "MAP@1000": 1.0, "MAP@10000": 1.0}, "recall": {"Recall@10": 1.0, "Recall@100": 1.0, "Recall@1000": 1.0, "Recall@10000": 1.0}, "precision": {"P@10": 0.1, "P@100": 0.01, "P@1000": 0.001, "P@10000": 0.0001}, "delta": 0.0, "instruction": "expand", "query": "what is the difference between ron and mon", "query_id": "test123", "dataset": "nq", "generator_model": "ollama_chat/phi4:14b-q8_0", "temperature": 1.0}
