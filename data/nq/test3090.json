{"reasoning": "The original query seeks to identify which album by The Beatles includes the song 'Help!'. Given that results predominantly focus on music history and discography, this indicates both an informational intent and a potential need for precise terminologies related to albums. Analyzing core concepts reveals direct entities like 'album', 'song title', and 'The Beatles', with specific connections to the track 'Help!' and its corresponding album release. By constructing a conceptual graph, we establish nodes such as 'Help!', '1965 album releases', and attributes such as 'Beatles' discography'. This allows us to select expansion paths like synonymous terms (e.g., 'track'), hierarchical terms ('studio albums'), compositional elements ('tracks on Help!'), contextual terms ('British Invasion music scene'), and domain-specific terminology ('reprise, side one of the album'). The extracted high-value expansion terms should be filtered based on relevance, distinctiveness from original query words, specificity, and searchability within music discography documents. This results in an augmented query that remains true to the original informational intent while broadening the potential for relevant document retrieval.", "query_goals": ["Identify core concepts such as 'album', 'song title', and specific entities like 'Help!' and 'The Beatles'.", "Determine search intent: Informational, seeking details about the album associated with a particular song by The Beatles.", "List implicit assumptions: Assume familiarity with music discography terminology and context of release periods."], "node_classes": ["Core Entities: Help!, Album", "First-order Connections: Song title, Release Year", "Second-order Connections: Studio Albums, Discography", "Domain Contexts: Music History, British Invasion"], "query_nodes": ["Help!", "The Beatles", "Album", "Song Title"], "nearest_neighbors": ["'Rubber Soul' (album)", "1965 studio album releases", "'Ticket to Ride' (song by The Beatles)", "'Revolver' (Beatles album)", "Help! reprise", "British Invasion music", "UK and US chart history"], "augmented_query": "What album is Help! by the Beatles on, related to 1965 studio albums or British Invasion music?", "ndcg": {"NDCG@10": 1.0, "NDCG@100": 1.0, "NDCG@1000": 1.0, "NDCG@10000": 1.0}, "map": {"MAP@10": 1.0, "MAP@100": 1.0, "MAP@1000": 1.0, "MAP@10000": 1.0}, "recall": {"Recall@10": 1.0, "Recall@100": 1.0, "Recall@1000": 1.0, "Recall@10000": 1.0}, "precision": {"P@10": 0.1, "P@100": 0.01, "P@1000": 0.001, "P@10000": 0.0001}, "delta": 0.56932, "instruction": "graph", "query": "what album is help by the beatles on", "query_id": "test3090", "dataset": "nq", "generator_model": "ollama_chat/phi4:14b-q8_0", "temperature": 1.0}
