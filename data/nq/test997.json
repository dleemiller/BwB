{"reasoning": "The query seeks to understand how 36 can be expressed as a product of prime numbers. Given that some documents highlight relevant aspects such as the factors 2 and 3, we can reinforce this understanding through metaphorical thinking, allowing us to generate new terms and perspectives. Metaphorical mappings from diverse domains (nature, art, mechanics) will help enrich our exploration by drawing analogies between familiar concepts and prime factorization.\n\nBy using metaphors, we aim to identify a variety of ways to express the decomposition of 36 into its prime factors, \\(2^2 \\times 3^2\\). This approach involves creating metaphors that reflect processes or structures from other domains which parallel prime factorization. By mapping elements of these domains back to mathematical concepts, we can uncover new terminologies and insights.\n\nTo achieve this:\n1. Generate diverse metaphors related to the process of decomposing a number into primes.\n2. Map specific components within each metaphor to parts of the original query (e.g., factors as building blocks).\n3. Extract terminology that could illuminate or offer fresh perspectives on prime factorization.\n4.
