{"reasoning": "The original query seeks to understand who appoints members of the various branches within the United States government. The main focus is on appointment processes, particularly for roles typically understood to be appointed rather than elected. The strengths lie in addressing federal and executive appointments but miss direct coverage of legislative branch appointments (Senators and Representatives are elected). Weaknesses include information about non-U.S. or tangential topics such as the Electoral College and Puerto Rico's judiciary. An effective augmented query should thus expand on appointment processes across all branches, including nuances like indirect methods through elections for Congress.", "query_goals": ["Clarify the appointment process of federal judges", "Identify who appoints executive branch officials and the role of Senate confirmation", "Examine mechanisms for Congressional appointments, noting that they involve election rather than appointment", "Highlight any unique processes or exceptions in different branches"], "ineffective_terms": ["Electoral College", "Puerto Rico judiciary", "Patronage politics"], "breadth_expansion": ["confirmation process", "Senate approval", "judicial nominees", "executive nominations", "legislative elections", "independent agencies appointment"], "depth_chain": ["presidential appointments", "Senate confirmation votes", "nomination procedures for executive officials", "appointment powers of independent agency heads", "confirmation role of legislative committees"], "augmented_query": "Senate confirmation, nomination procedures, independent agencies appointment, confirmation role of legislative committees", "ndcg": {"NDCG@10": 1.0, "NDCG@100": 1.0, "NDCG@1000": 1.0, "NDCG@10000": 1.0}, "map": {"MAP@10": 1.0, "MAP@100": 1.0, "MAP@1000": 1.0, "MAP@10000": 1.0}, "recall": {"Recall@10": 1.0, "Recall@100": 1.0, "Recall@1000": 1.0, "Recall@10000": 1.0}, "precision": {"P@10": 0.1, "P@100": 0.01, "P@1000": 0.001, "P@10000": 0.0001}, "delta": 0.66667, "instruction": "expand", "query": "who appoints the members of the given branch in the united states", "query_id": "test115", "dataset": "nq", "generator_model": "ollama_chat/phi4:14b-q8_0", "temperature": 1.0}
