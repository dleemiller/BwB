{"reasoning": "To expand on the query \"what is the meaning of the name von,\" we consider the core concept, which revolves around etymology, history, cultural implications, and genealogy associated with this surname prefix. The current results effectively cover linguistic roots and historical context, especially within European regions like Germany and Austria. However, they miss out on contemporary usage, global distribution, and nuances of its application in non-noble contexts today.\n\nThe central coordinates are set around the intersection of etymology and history, particularly focusing on the nobiliary usage of \"von\" as well as its broader social implications over time. The boundaries extend into cultural studies, sociology (in terms of class implications), and potentially legal frameworks where surnames play a role in identity and heritage.\n\nLandmarks within this conceptual territory include key historical contexts such as Prussian society and the Austrian Empire, notable etymological sources like German linguistic roots, and sociocultural practices surrounding naming conventions. Detailed features encompass variations across different regions and periods, along with contemporary implications for people carrying such surnames today.\n\nNavigation terms are selected to guide deeper exploration into each of these domains, ensuring a comprehensive understanding that moves beyond traditional contexts into modern applications and perceptions.", "central_coordinates": ["etymology", "historical context", "nobiliary usage"], "boundary_areas": ["cultural studies", "sociology", "genealogy", "linguistics", "European history", "modern social implications", "legal frameworks for naming"], "key_landmarks": ["Prussian society", "Austrian Empire practices", "German linguistic roots", "naming conventions", "historical nobility distinctions", "class and identity in surname usage"], "detail_features": ["regional variations of \"von\"", "period-specific applications (medieval, renaissance)", "non-noble contemporary uses", "transitions from noble to common use over time", "global distribution beyond Europe", "legal implications in modern contexts"], "navigation_terms": ["nobiliary particle", "surnames and identity", "linguistic etymology of Germanic names", "historical social classes", "naming conventions evolution", "genealogy and heritage studies"], "augmented_query": "meaning of \"von\" as a nobiliary particle in historical European contexts, contemporary usage of the surname \"von,\" variations and implications of \"von\" across different regions including non-European countries", "ndcg": {"NDCG@10": 1.0, "NDCG@100": 1.0, "NDCG@1000": 1.0, "NDCG@10000": 1.0}, "map": {"MAP@10": 1.0, "MAP@100": 1.0, "MAP@1000": 1.0, "MAP@10000": 1.0}, "recall": {"Recall@10": 1.0, "Recall@100": 1.0, "Recall@1000": 1.0, "Recall@10000": 1.0}, "precision": {"P@10": 0.1, "P@100": 0.01, "P@1000": 0.001, "P@10000": 0.0001}, "delta": 0.5, "instruction": "cartography", "query": "what is the meaning of the name von", "query_id": "test1721", "dataset": "nq", "generator_model": "ollama_chat/phi4:14b-q8_0", "temperature": 1.0}
