{"reasoning": "The original query, \"who is next in line to inherit the British throne,\" seeks current information about the line of succession. The existing results are strong in providing historical context and legal frameworks, but they lack up-to-date specifics, such as current individuals in line for the throne. To address this weakness, we need to expand the search by focusing on current monarchy details, recent changes to succession laws, and identifying key figures today.\n\nThe strategy involves using a conceptual graph that captures core concepts from the query, like the British monarchy, succession rules, and specific historical events or legal acts mentioned in documents. We will then extend these ideas with nodes for contemporary elements and terms directly related to current line of succession details. The expansion paths we focus on include synonymous and domain-specific terminology such as recent royal family members and changes due to laws enacted after 2011 (e.g., Succession to the Crown Act).\n\nTo improve retrieval, our aim is to incorporate these expansions into an augmented query that still aligns with the original search intent \u2014 identifying who currently stands next in line for the British throne.
