{"reasoning": "The query seeks to understand the specific location of cones in the eye, particularly within its anatomical structure. Existing search results provide accurate information on cone locations but are sometimes clouded by broader or unrelated topics. Metaphorical thinking can enhance understanding and discovery of conceptually related terms by drawing parallels from diverse domains, making complex anatomy more accessible.\n\nThe metaphor generation process aims to create vivid imagery from different fields that help elucidate the topic of cones in the eye. By mapping elements between the source (metaphor) and target (eye anatomy) domains, we can highlight key features and complementary perspectives on cone location. Exploring domain-specific language further enhances this understanding.\n\nExtended metaphors uncover additional connections and reveal hidden aspects of the topic, potentially leading to hybrid perspectives that synthesize insights from multiple fields. Lastly, extracting cross-domain terms provides new angles for viewing the original query's subject matter, making complex anatomical information more understandable and engaging.", "generated_metaphors": ["The retina is like a densely packed forest where cones are trees concentrated in an open meadow (fovea centralis).", "Cone cells in the eye function as individual spotlights on a grand stage, with a focused beam at center stage and scattered lights filling the rest of the theater.", "Imagine the retina as a high-resolution camera sensor, where cones are densely packed pixels in the central focal point.", "The distribution of cones resembles an orchestra hall, with concentrated sound (cones) in the front rows (fovea) and diminishing to the back seats (peripheral retina).", "Cones in the eye can be likened to stars in a galaxy, densely clustered in the galactic core (fovea centralis) but spread throughout space."], "domain_mappings": ["Forest -> Retina: Trees -> Cones; Open meadow -> Fovea centralis", "Theater -> Eye: Spotlights -> Cone cells; Stage -> Retina", "Camera Sensor -> Retina: Pixels -> Cones; Central focal point -> Fovea centralis", "Orchestra Hall -> Retina: Sound intensity -> Concentration of cones; Front rows -> Fovea", "Galaxy -> Retina: Stars -> Cones; Galactic core -> Fovea centralis"], "metaphorical_language": ["Forest, meadow, trees, dense foliage", "Spotlights, stage lights, theater, focused beam", "Camera sensor, high-resolution, pixels, focal point", "Orchestra, sound intensity, concert hall, acoustics", "Stars, galaxy, galactic core, celestial bodies"], "extended_metaphors": ["In the forest of the retina, as you move away from the open meadow of cones in the fovea centralis into denser woodland, the types and functions of photoreceptors shift subtly.", "Spotlights on a theater stage not only illuminate actors but also enhance mood; similarly, the density of cone cells shapes how we perceive colors and details.", "A high-resolution camera sensor might capture a panoramic view with varying clarity; in the eye, this is akin to seeing sharply at the center (fovea) while perceiving less detail toward the edges.", "In an orchestra, the acoustics change as you move from the front row to the back, analogous to the gradation of cone cell density influencing visual clarity across the retina.", "Within a galaxy, certain star clusters emit varying light intensities; this mirrors how cones distribute and vary in function within different regions of the retina."], "cross_domain_terms": ["Focal point", "Density distribution", "Acoustic acuity", "Pixelated vision", "Celestial arrangement"], "augmented_query": "\"Where are the cones located in the eye with respect to their concentrated position similar to a densely packed meadow, camera sensor pixels at focal point, orchestra's front row acoustics, spotlight stage beam, or galactic core stars?\"", "ndcg": {"NDCG@10": 1.0, "NDCG@100": 1.0, "NDCG@1000": 1.0, "NDCG@10000": 1.0}, "map": {"MAP@10": 1.0, "MAP@100": 1.0, "MAP@1000": 1.0, "MAP@10000": 1.0}, "recall": {"Recall@10": 1.0, "Recall@100": 1.0, "Recall@1000": 1.0, "Recall@10000": 1.0}, "precision": {"P@10": 0.1, "P@100": 0.01, "P@1000": 0.001, "P@10000": 0.0001}, "delta": 0.56932, "instruction": "metaphor", "query": "where are the cones in the eye located", "query_id": "test2430", "dataset": "nq", "generator_model": "ollama_chat/phi4:14b-q8_0", "temperature": 1.0}
