{"reasoning": "The primary goal of the original query is to understand whether a Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) filing can be made against an individual, specifically focusing on the legal context. The results indicate that the search algorithm failed to align with this goal by pulling in documents irrelevant to UCC filings or their applicability to individuals. To address these weaknesses and enhance the effectiveness of the search query, several strategies will be employed: removing ineffective terms like \"individual,\" which led to a misalignment; expanding the query contextually using legal terminology associated with UCC filings; and diving deeper into related topics such as debtor obligations under the UCC.", "query_goals": ["Clarify if individuals can be subject to UCC filings", "Understand legal implications of UCC for individuals", "Determine specific circumstances or cases where an individual might be involved in a UCC filing"], "ineffective_terms": ["individual", "can"], "breadth_expansion": ["Uniform Commercial Code", "secured transactions", "personal guarantees", "debtor-creditor law", "collateral", "lien"], "depth_chain": ["Personal Guarantees under UCC", "Individual Debtor Obligations", "Collateral for Individual Loans", "Liens on Personal Property", "Consumer Protection in Secured Transactions"], "augmented_query": "'UCC filing requirements, personal guarantees, debtor obligations, secured transactions individual impact, collateral liens consumer protection'", "ndcg": {"NDCG@10": 0.81753, "NDCG@100": 0.81753, "NDCG@1000": 0.81753, "NDCG@10000": 0.81753}, "map": {"MAP@10": 0.64286, "MAP@100": 0.64286, "MAP@1000": 0.64286, "MAP@10000": 0.64286}, "recall": {"Recall@10": 1.0, "Recall@100": 1.0, "Recall@1000": 1.0, "Recall@10000": 1.0}, "precision": {"P@10": 0.2, "P@100": 0.02, "P@1000": 0.002, "P@10000": 0.0002}, "delta": 0.46305999999999997, "instruction": "expand", "query": "can a ucc be filed on an individual", "query_id": "test1635", "dataset": "nq", "generator_model": "ollama_chat/phi4:14b-q8_0", "temperature": 1.0}
