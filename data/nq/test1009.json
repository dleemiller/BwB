{"reasoning": "The query \"who plays heather in beauty and the beast\" aims to find information about actors playing the character Heather, specifically in two different adaptations: the CW TV series \"Beauty & The Beast\" (which is actually \"Heathers\") and potentially references might be made to other versions like films or musicals. The current search results provide direct answers but suffer from a lack of clarity regarding which adaptation they are referring to.\n\nTo improve the query, we need to enhance precision by:\n1. Identifying core concepts such as specific adaptations (CW series vs animated film).\n2. Considering synonymous and hierarchical terms that relate to characters and actors within those contexts.\n3. Leveraging domain-specific terminology related to television casting and character roles.\n4. Expanding context with additional qualifiers that can help differentiate between various interpretations or adaptations of \"Beauty & The Beast.\"\n\nThe conceptual graph should include core nodes representing key entities like \"Heather,\" adaptation types, relevant media titles, and potentially notable cast members already known for those series.", "query_goals": ["Identify the specific adaptations of 'Beauty & The Beast' to clarify search intent.", "Distinguish between characters named Heather in different versions (TV series vs film).", "Focus on retrieving actor information relevant specifically to CW series adaptations.", "Enhance specificity and clarity by narrowing down contextual information related to media types."], "node_classes": ["Character Name", "Media Title", "Actor Name", "Series Type", "Adaptation Version"], "query_nodes": ["Heather (Heathers)", "Heather (Beauty & The Beast)", "Beauty & The Beast (CW series)", "Nicole Gale Anderson", "Melanie Field"], "nearest_neighbors": ["Nicole Gale Anderson as Heather Chandler in 'Heathers'", "Melanie Field as Heather McNamara in 'Heathers'", "'Heathers' TV series cast", "Beauty & The Beast (animated) characters", "Beauty & The Beast CW series"], "augmented_query": "\"Who plays Heather in the CW series 'Heathers'?
