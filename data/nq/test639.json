{"reasoning": "The current search results indicate that while some documents provide relevant etymological information about the name \"Robinson,\" there are numerous unrelated entries diluting the focus. The goal is to enhance retrieval specificity by honing in on historical, linguistic, and cultural aspects of surname origins. By constructing a conceptual graph centered around the core concept of surname etymology, we can identify meaningful expansions through hierarchical terms (broader concepts such as patronymic naming conventions), compositional terms (components like \"Robin\" itself), contextual terms (historical contexts where surnames were adopted in England), and domain-specific terminology (terms commonly used in genealogy or linguistic studies). This approach ensures that the expanded query not only maintains but enhances the original search intent, leading to more precise retrieval of documents.", "query_goals": ["Determine the historical origins and etymology of the surname \"Robinson\"", "Exclude unrelated topics such as fictional narratives and map projections", "Incorporate linguistic and cultural contexts surrounding surnames in English history"], "node_classes": ["Core Concepts", "First-Order Connections", "Second-Order Connections", "Domain Contexts"], "query_nodes": ["Robinson surname origin", "Patronymic naming convention", "English etymology", "Surname adoption in England"], "nearest_neighbors": ["Robin (given name)", "Patronyms", "Middle Ages English surnames", "Anglo-Saxon naming practices", "Genealogy and heraldry"], "augmented_query": "what is the origin of the name Robinson including patronymic naming conventions, Robin given name etymology, historical surname adoption in England", "ndcg": {"NDCG@10": 1.0, "NDCG@100": 1.0, "NDCG@1000": 1.0, "NDCG@10000": 1.0}, "map": {"MAP@10": 1.0, "MAP@100": 1.0, "MAP@1000": 1.0, "MAP@10000": 1.0}, "recall": {"Recall@10": 1.0, "Recall@100": 1.0, "Recall@1000": 1.0, "Recall@10000": 1.0}, "precision": {"P@10": 0.1, "P@100": 0.01, "P@1000": 0.001, "P@10000": 0.0001}, "delta": 0.36907, "instruction": "graph", "query": "what is the origin of the name robinson", "query_id": "test639", "dataset": "nq", "generator_model": "ollama_chat/phi4:14b-q8_0", "temperature": 1.0}
