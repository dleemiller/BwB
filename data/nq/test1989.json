{"reasoning": "The primary objective of the original query is to identify the product formed when krypton-85 undergoes beta decay, which involves understanding nuclear transformation. However, there are gaps in providing additional context about applications or broader implications beyond merely stating the decay product. The current search results mainly focus on scientific and technical aspects without expanding into related domains like practical uses of rubidium-85 or broader applications in technology. By identifying ineffective terms from the query that lead to non-specific results, we can redirect focus towards specific expansions that would yield richer contextual insights. Breadth expansion will introduce new dimensions such as related elements or processes, while depth expansion delves into significant aspects like practical applications of the decay product.", "query_goals": ["Identify the direct product of krypton-85 beta decay", "Understand broader implications and uses of rubidium-85 in technology", "Explore nuclear transformations with a focus on application-oriented information"], "ineffective_terms": ["decays", "emission", "particle"], "breadth_expansion": ["rubidium applications", "radioactive decay usage", "beta emission energy utilization", "nuclear medicine applications", "isotope tracing techniques"], "depth_chain": ["nuclear medicine", "diagnostic imaging", "radiopharmaceuticals", "gamma cameras", "MRI contrast agents"], "augmented_query": "rubidium applications, radiochemistry uses, nuclear medicine diagnostics, radiopharmaceutical development, gamma camera technology, MRI imaging enhancements", "ndcg": {"NDCG@10": 1.0, "NDCG@100": 1.0, "NDCG@1000": 1.0, "NDCG@10000": 1.0}, "map": {"MAP@10": 1.0, "MAP@100": 1.0, "MAP@1000": 1.0, "MAP@10000": 1.0}, "recall": {"Recall@10": 1.0, "Recall@100": 1.0, "Recall@1000": 1.0, "Recall@10000": 1.0}, "precision": {"P@10": 0.1, "P@100": 0.01, "P@1000": 0.001, "P@10000": 0.0001}, "delta": 0.0, "instruction": "expand", "query": "krypton-85 decays by emission of a beta particle. the product of this decay is", "query_id": "test1989", "dataset": "nq", "generator_model": "ollama_chat/phi4:14b-q8_0", "temperature": 1.0}
