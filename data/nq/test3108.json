{"reasoning": "The goal is to enhance the query \"who talks for belle in beauty and the beast\" by identifying semantically relevant terms that can improve document retrieval. The current results predominantly identify Paige O'Hara as Belle's original voice actor but include unrelated content such as plot details or event reports. This suggests an opportunity to expand the query with more specific terms related to voice acting, character analysis, and film production.\n\n**Query Analysis:**  \n- **Core Concepts**: Belle (character), voice acting, \"Beauty and the Beast\" (film/animated feature).  \n- **Search Intent**: Informational; seeking a specific fact about the movie's casting.  \n- **Implicit Assumptions**: The user is interested in voice acting details rather than plot or thematic elements.\n\n**Graph Construction:**  \nThe graph should focus on nodes such as Belle, voice actors, and \"Beauty and the Beast,\" with connections to terms like film production roles, animation studios (e.g., Disney), and related adaptations. First-order connections might include specific casting information and second-order could explore other notable voice actors or cast members associated with the movie.\n\n**Expansion Path Selection:**  \n- **Synonymous Terms**: Focus on synonyms for voice acting like \"voice artist\" or \"dubbing.\"\n- **Hierarchical Terms**: Include broader categories such as animated films, Disney animations.\n- **Compositional Terms**: Explore components related to film production like casting directors.\n- **Contextual Terms**: Consider settings where this information might be discussed (e.g., movie reviews, interviews).\n- **Domain-Specific Terminology**: Use terms specific to voice acting or animation industry jargon.\n\n**Term Extraction and Filtering:**  \nTerms are selected based on relevance to the core query about voice actors, distinctiveness from plot summaries, specificity in relation to \"Beauty and the Beast,\" and likelihood of appearing in relevant documents about voice casting details.", "query_goals": ["Identify specific roles involved in the animation process", "Clarify the search for voice acting information over other movie elements", "Incorporate industry-specific terms related to animated film production", "Focus on actors associated specifically with 'Beauty and the Beast'", "Enhance retrieval by including synonyms or related concepts to 'voice acting'"], "node_classes": ["Character", "Role", "Film Production", "Animated Feature", "Voice Actor", "Casting", "Disney", "Animation Studio"], "query_nodes": ["Belle", "Beauty and the Beast", "voice actor"], "nearest_neighbors": ["Paige O'Hara", "animation", "Disney animation", "animated movies", "Casting director for Beauty and the Beast", "Voice actress", "Dubbing artist"], "augmented_query": "\"who voices belle in beauty and the beast? voice acting Disney animated film casting\"", "ndcg": {"NDCG@10": 1.0, "NDCG@100": 1.0, "NDCG@1000": 1.0, "NDCG@10000": 1.0}, "map": {"MAP@10": 1.0, "MAP@100": 1.0, "MAP@1000": 1.0, "MAP@10000": 1.0}, "recall": {"Recall@10": 1.0, "Recall@100": 1.0, "Recall@1000": 1.0, "Recall@10000": 1.0}, "precision": {"P@10": 0.1, "P@100": 0.01, "P@1000": 0.001, "P@10000": 0.0001}, "delta": 0.0, "instruction": "graph", "query": "who talks for belle in beauty and the beast", "query_id": "test3108", "dataset": "nq", "generator_model": "ollama_chat/phi4:14b-q8_0", "temperature": 1.0}
