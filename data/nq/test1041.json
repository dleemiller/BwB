{"reasoning": "The primary objective is to enhance search retrieval by expanding the original query \"what is the genus of a bald eagle\" into a more comprehensive set of terms that can capture related scientific, ecological, legal, and conservation-related contexts. The analysis shows that the current results are effective at addressing taxonomic information but lack breadth in covering related domains like ecology or legal frameworks concerning the species. To remedy this, we aim to construct a conceptual graph that identifies core concepts linked with the bald eagle's genus while exploring various dimensions for query expansion. We will utilize synonymous terms, hierarchical taxonomy terms, contextual environmental and conservation references, and domain-specific terminology (such as those used in legal texts) to ensure robust retrieval across different document types.", "query_goals": ["Identify the taxonomic classification of the bald eagle at the genus level", "Provide ecological context relevant to the bald eagle's natural habitat and behavior", "Explore conservation status and protections under U.S. law"], "node_classes": ["Taxonomy", "Biology", "Ecology", "Conservation", "Legal Contexts", "Species Behavior"], "query_nodes": ["bald eagle", "genus", "Haliaeetus leucocephalus", "taxonomy", "species classification"], "nearest_neighbors": ["species of raptors", "bird conservation laws", "aquatic birds", "northern hemisphere avian species", "habitat preservation for birds"], "augmented_query": "\"genus Haliaeetus leucocephalus bald eagle classification taxonomy Aquila family habitat ecosystem legal protection status Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act\"", "ndcg": {"NDCG@10": 1.0, "NDCG@100": 1.0, "NDCG@1000": 1.0, "NDCG@10000": 1.0}, "map": {"MAP@10": 1.0, "MAP@100": 1.0, "MAP@1000": 1.0, "MAP@10000": 1.0}, "recall": {"Recall@10": 1.0, "Recall@100": 1.0, "Recall@1000": 1.0, "Recall@10000": 1.0}, "precision": {"P@10": 0.1, "P@100": 0.01, "P@1000": 0.001, "P@10000": 0.0001}, "delta": 0.0, "instruction": "graph", "query": "what is the genus of a bald eagle", "query_id": "test1041", "dataset": "nq", "generator_model": "ollama_chat/phi4:14b-q8_0", "temperature": 1.0}
