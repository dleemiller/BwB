{"reasoning": "The query aims to identify the main artist of the song 'Somebody's Watching Me' while recognizing Michael Jackson's contribution. The current search results mix relevant details with unrelated information about other Michael Jackson projects, diluting the focus needed for this specific query. To improve relevance, it is necessary to hone in on terms and contexts that connect more directly to music collaboration without general or unrelated elements pertaining to Michael Jackson alone. By refining ineffective terms, expanding the breadth of related concepts, and delving deeper into one selected path (depth chain), a new set of focused search terms can be established to better target results within the domains of music discographies and collaborations.", "query_goals": ["Identify the primary artist responsible for 'Somebody's Watching Me'.", "Highlight Michael Jackson's specific contributions without overshadowing Rockwell.", "Filter out unrelated information about Michael Jackson\u2019s other works.", "Target documents focusing on musical collaboration."], "ineffective_terms": ["Michael Jackson"], "breadth_expansion": ["duet", "vocal feature", "guest appearance", "1980s pop music collaborations", "production credits", "music video contributions"], "depth_chain": ["production credits", "songwriting collaborations", "recording session details", "studio musicians in pop songs", "vocal production techniques"], "augmented_query": "Rockwell Somebody's Watching Me guest vocals production 1980s duets music video collaboration studio sessions vocal producers", "ndcg": {"NDCG@10": 1.0, "NDCG@100": 1.0, "NDCG@1000": 1.0, "NDCG@10000": 1.0}, "map": {"MAP@10": 1.0, "MAP@100": 1.0, "MAP@1000": 1.0, "MAP@10000": 1.0}, "recall": {"Recall@10": 1.0, "Recall@100": 1.0, "Recall@1000": 1.0, "Recall@10000": 1.0}, "precision": {"P@10": 0.1, "P@100": 0.01, "P@1000": 0.001, "P@10000": 0.0001}, "delta": 0.0, "instruction": "expand", "query": "who sings somebody's watching me with michael jackson", "query_id": "test2079", "dataset": "nq", "generator_model": "ollama_chat/phi4:14b-q8_0", "temperature": 1.0}
