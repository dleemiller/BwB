{"reasoning": "The query seeks to understand the function of semicolons in C programming, focusing on their role within statements. To address both strengths (the understanding of semicolons as statement terminators) and weaknesses (lack of direct examples and some irrelevant results), we'll engage experts from different disciplines who can enrich this exploration with diverse perspectives. These include Computer Science for technical accuracy, Linguistics for a broader linguistic perspective on punctuation, Education for how programming concepts are taught, History to contextualize the evolution of C's syntax, and Software Engineering for practical application insights. Each expert provides specialized knowledge and terminology that will help formulate an augmented query incorporating additional dimensions beyond the core function in C.", "selected_experts": ["Dr. Jane Smith - Computer Science Professor specializing in programming language theory", "Prof. Alan Johnson - Linguist focusing on syntax and punctuation marks", "Dr. Mary Brown - Educator with expertise in computer science pedagogy", "Dr. Robert White - Historian of computing and programming languages", "Ms. Lisa Green - Software Engineer with extensive experience in C-based projects"], "expert_insights": ["Dr. Jane Smith explains that semicolons serve as statement terminators, separating distinct commands or expressions within a sequence.
