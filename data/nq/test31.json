{"reasoning": "The query \"who do you meet at the gates of heaven\" is seeking information about figures or entities encountered upon entering heaven, a concept predominantly explored in religious contexts. The primary goal is to identify relevant sources that explore these encounters across various perspectives, especially beyond the current Christian-centric approach.\n\nTo achieve an effective query expansion, we analyze existing strengths and weaknesses:\n- **Strengths**: Results encompass scriptural references, allegories, cultural depictions, and literary interpretations from a Christian perspective.\n- **Weaknesses**: The focus is heavily on Christian theology with insufficient inclusion of other religious or cultural viewpoints. Some results diverge by discussing broader theological concepts rather than directly addressing who meets individuals at heaven's gates.\n\n**Query Analysis:**\nThe query targets entities met at the entrance to heaven, hinting at an interest in religious symbolism and afterlife experiences across different cultures and traditions. The intent is informational with a focus on understanding spiritual and religious narratives about heaven\u2019s entry.\n\n**Graph Construction:**\n- **Core Nodes**: Entities commonly referenced in religious texts as being present at the gates of heaven (e.g., St. Peter).\n- **First-order Connections**: Related roles, symbols, or entities in Christian doctrine.\n- **Second-order Connections**: Broader concepts such as \"guardians,\" \"angels,\" and other cultural equivalents in different religions like Islam or Hinduism.\n- **Domain Contexts**: Theological studies, comparative religion, and cultural anthropology.\n\n**Expansion Path Selection:**\n1. **Synonymous Terms**: Exploring terms synonymous with \"gates of heaven\" across religious texts (e.g., Pearly Gates).\n2. **Hierarchical Terms**: Broader religious concepts involving afterlife entry.\n3. **Contextual Terms**: Different cultural depictions or interpretations beyond Christian theology, such as Islamic Jannah or Hindu Moksha.\n4. **Domain-specific Terminology**: Specific theological terms from multiple religions.\n\n**Term Extraction and Filtering:**\nFrom each path, the focus will be on selecting terms that align with diverse religious teachings about afterlife entry points and are likely to appear in relevant documents:\n- Synonymous terms (e.g., Pearly Gates)\n- Figures or entities (e.g., St. Peter, Guardian Angel)\n- Broader concepts (e.g., Guardians of Heaven, Angels at the Threshold)\n- Cultural counterparts (e.g., Islamic Jannah entrance, Hindu Moksha)\n- Religious symbols (e.g., Archangel Michael, Golden Gate)\n\n**Augmented Query Construction:**\nCombine original query with selected terms to broaden search scope and inclusivity. This would enable retrieval of documents that provide varied interpretations of the concept.", "query_goals": ["Identify core entities traditionally mentioned at the gates of heaven", "Explore synonymous terms across different religious contexts", "Expand understanding through broader afterlife entry concepts", "Incorporate diverse cultural depictions beyond Christian theology"], "node_classes": ["Religious Entities", "Symbolic Representations", "Cultural Narratives", "Theological Concepts"], "query_nodes": ["Gates of Heaven", "St. Peter", "Pearly Gates", "Afterlife Entry"], "nearest_neighbors": ["Guardian Angel", "Archangel Michael", "Golden Gate", "Islamic Jannah Entrance", "Hindu Moksha Transition", "Saints and Angels", "Threshold Guardians"], "augmented_query": "'who do you meet at the gates of heaven OR Pearly Gates OR St. Peter OR Guardian Angel OR Archangel Michael OR Golden Gate OR Islamic Jannah entrance OR Hindu Moksha transition'", "ndcg": {"NDCG@10": 1.0, "NDCG@100": 1.0, "NDCG@1000": 1.0, "NDCG@10000": 1.0}, "map": {"MAP@10": 1.0, "MAP@100": 1.0, "MAP@1000": 1.0, "MAP@10000": 1.0}, "recall": {"Recall@10": 1.0, "Recall@100": 1.0, "Recall@1000": 1.0, "Recall@10000": 1.0}, "precision": {"P@10": 0.1, "P@100": 0.01, "P@1000": 0.001, "P@10000": 0.0001}, "delta": 0.56932, "instruction": "graph", "query": "who do you meet at the gates of heaven", "query_id": "test31", "dataset": "nq", "generator_model": "ollama_chat/phi4:14b-q8_0", "temperature": 1.0}
