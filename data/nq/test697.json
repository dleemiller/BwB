{"reasoning": "The original query \"how long is one full rotation of the earth\" seeks a straightforward answer to Earth's rotational period, which commonly refers to its sidereal day. The existing results, while strong in technical depth and methodological insights into the dynamics affecting Earth's rotation, fall short in directly addressing this simple inquiry. They delve into complex phenomena like tidal locking and angular momentum without explicitly stating that one full rotation of the Earth is approximately 23 hours, 56 minutes, and 4 seconds\u2014a sidereal day\u2014and 24 hours for a solar day due to Earth\u2019s orbit around the Sun.
