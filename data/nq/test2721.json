{"reasoning": "The original query seeks information specifically about the number of episodes in a particular adaptation, \"Ordeal by Innocence,\" which suggests an informational intent focusing on media content. The relevant search result provides accurate data but indicates broader confusion with other irrelevant topics. To enhance the query's precision and relevance, we can refine it using a conceptual graph that considers several dimensions: the work itself (Agatha Christie\u2019s novel), its adaptations, particularly the television series, and any specific networks or production details.\n\nThe goal is to ensure search engines or databases focus on media listings, adaptation-specific information, and perhaps even production contexts. By constructing a conceptual graph with nodes representing key concepts like \"BBC drama,\" \"series,\" \"episodes,\" etc., we can traverse connections such as synonymous terms (e.g., miniseries), hierarchical ones (e.g., specific episodes), and contextual associations (e.g., other adaptations).\n\nThe strengths of the current results highlight that the information about episode counts exists but is buried amongst unrelated content. Therefore, focusing expansion efforts on these media-specific elements will likely yield a more targeted retrieval. For example, incorporating terms like \"television adaptation\" or specifying platforms like \"BBC\" could help in honing search precision.", "query_goals": ["Identify the number of episodes in the specific adaptation of \"Ordeal by Innocence\" on television.", "Ensure that searches target media-related content (e.g., listings, summaries) to avoid irrelevant results.", "Refine focus on adaptations specifically labeled as television series or miniseries."], "node_classes": ["Literary Work", "Adaptation Type", "Media Platform", "Episode Information", "Production Context"], "query_nodes": ["Ordeal by Innocence", "BBC drama", "Television series"], "nearest_neighbors": ["Miniseries", "Television adaptation", "Season episodes", "British television", "Crime dramas"], "augmented_query": "\"number of episodes in BBC Ordeal by Innocence miniseries\"", "ndcg": {"NDCG@10": 1.0, "NDCG@100": 1.0, "NDCG@1000": 1.0, "NDCG@10000": 1.0}, "map": {"MAP@10": 1.0, "MAP@100": 1.0, "MAP@1000": 1.0, "MAP@10000": 1.0}, "recall": {"Recall@10": 1.0, "Recall@100": 1.0, "Recall@1000": 1.0, "Recall@10000": 1.0}, "precision": {"P@10": 0.1, "P@100": 0.01, "P@1000": 0.001, "P@10000": 0.0001}, "delta": 0.0, "instruction": "graph", "query": "how many episodes are there in ordeal by innocence", "query_id": "test2721", "dataset": "nq", "generator_model": "ollama_chat/phi4:14b-q8_0", "temperature": 1.0}
