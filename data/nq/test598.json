{"reasoning": "The original query focuses on pinpointing the release date of toddlers in The Sims 4. While one document directly addresses this by providing the specific patch information, other documents are more general and offer context across various versions of The Sims rather than specifics about The Sims 4 toddlers' introduction. This indicates a gap in content around detailed insights into updates or features specific to The Sims 4, as well as historical significance within the game series.\n\nFor Task 1, the goal is clear: ascertain precise information about when toddlers were introduced in The Sims 4. Identifying gaps reveals that while the basic question is addressed, more nuanced details like update impact and feature descriptions are lacking. \n\nTask 2 highlights ineffective terms which do not contribute to narrowing down or adding specificity to this query, such as vague references to life stages without dates.\n\nIn Task 3, breadth expansion involves considering various related but increasingly distant topics that could add dimensions to the user's understanding of The Sims 4 updates.\n\nTask 4 narrows this breadth by selecting one key concept from Task 3 and going deeper into specific expansions relevant to the original query. This helps focus on detailed aspects such as update mechanics, player reception, or feature impact.", "query_goals": ["Identify the specific release date of toddlers in The Sims 4", "Explore updates and patches related to The Sims 4", "Provide additional context on how this introduction impacted gameplay"], "ineffective_terms": ["life stages", "The Sims series", "The Sims 3"], "breadth_expansion": ["game updates", "patch notes for The Sims 4", "new features in gaming patches", "impact of toddler feature on gameplay", "community reaction to game updates", "development insights on The Sims 4 patches"], "depth_chain": ["Patch notes for The Sims 4", "Detailed update mechanics of January 2017 patch", "Community feedback and reviews on toddlers introduction", "Changes in gameplay dynamics post-toddler feature"], "augmented_query": "detailed patch notes January 2017 The Sims 4 community reaction game updates impact toddler feature gameplay dynamics", "ndcg": {"NDCG@10": 1.0, "NDCG@100": 1.0, "NDCG@1000": 1.0, "NDCG@10000": 1.0}, "map": {"MAP@10": 1.0, "MAP@100": 1.0, "MAP@1000": 1.0, "MAP@10000": 1.0}, "recall": {"Recall@10": 1.0, "Recall@100": 1.0, "Recall@1000": 1.0, "Recall@10000": 1.0}, "precision": {"P@10": 0.2, "P@100": 0.02, "P@1000": 0.002, "P@10000": 0.0002}, "delta": 0.28080000000000005, "instruction": "expand", "query": "when did the sims 4 toddlers come out", "query_id": "test598", "dataset": "nq", "generator_model": "ollama_chat/phi4:14b-q8_0", "temperature": 1.0}
