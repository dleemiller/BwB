{"reasoning": "The original query inaccurately claims that Vic Mensa died on June 6, 1993. Given the strength of existing documents accurately detailing his birth year and ongoing musical career, it's clear there's a factual error in the premise of the query. The task is to reframe the query to align with documented realities about Vic Mensa. This involves identifying core concepts such as Vic Mensa himself, his active presence, birth date, and contributions to music. By constructing a conceptual graph centered on these themes and exploring expansions through synonymous terms (e.g., 'Vic Mensa's career'), hierarchical terms ('Chicago rapper', 'hip-hop artist'), and contextual terms ('music projects with Chance the Rapper'), we aim to generate an augmented query that corrects misinformation while maintaining relevance. The nearest neighbors, or expansion terms, should offer clear pathways for information retrieval about Vic Mensa's actual life and achievements.", "query_goals": ["Correct misinformation in the original query", "Align search intent with factual documentation of Vic Mensa\u2019s career and contributions", "Identify high-value concepts that represent Vic Mensa accurately", "Generate an augmented query enhancing document retrieval about Vic Mensa", "Ensure expansion terms maintain specificity and relevance"], "node_classes": ["Person", "Date/Event", "Music Career", "Collaborations", "Biographical Information", "Misinformation Correction"], "query_nodes": ["Vic Mensa", "June 6, 1993", "Death", "Music career", "Chicago hip-hop community"], "nearest_neighbors": ["Vic Mensa birthdate", "Active music career", "Collaborations with Chance the Rapper", "Hip-hop artist", "2010s Chicago rapper", "Social issues advocacy through music", "Debut album release", "Vic Mensa\u2019s discography"], "augmented_query": "Vic Mensa biography and career achievements, including collaborations with Chance the Rapper, contributions to hip-hop, and involvement in social activism through music.", "ndcg": {"NDCG@10": 1.0, "NDCG@100": 1.0, "NDCG@1000": 1.0, "NDCG@10000": 1.0}, "map": {"MAP@10": 1.0, "MAP@100": 1.0, "MAP@1000": 1.0, "MAP@10000": 1.0}, "recall": {"Recall@10": 1.0, "Recall@100": 1.0, "Recall@1000": 1.0, "Recall@10000": 1.0}, "precision": {"P@10": 0.3, "P@100": 0.03, "P@1000": 0.003, "P@10000": 0.0003}, "delta": 0.03252999999999995, "instruction": "graph", "query": "Vic Mensa died June 6, 1993.", "query_id": "179815", "dataset": "fever", "generator_model": "ollama_chat/phi4:14b-q8_0", "temperature": 1.0}
