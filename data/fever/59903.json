{"reasoning": "The original query is focused on identifying a specific publication or event titled \"The Paper\" that was released in 1894. The current search results are broadly related to different types of 'paper', including informational and historical contexts, which indicates a mismatch between the user's intent and the retrieved documents. The main issue appears to be the lack of specificity regarding the release date and the specific context or type of 'paper' being referenced. To address this, we should aim for query expansion that highlights historical publications, periodicals from 1894, or significant events around that year that might relate specifically to a publication known as \"The Paper\". \n\nBy constructing a conceptual graph and expanding on nodes related to historical publications, 19th-century media outlets, and specific context tied to the year 1894, we can identify terms likely to lead to more relevant documents. The expansion should prioritize distinctiveness from current results by focusing less on types of 'paper' like toilet paper or commercial paper, and more towards periodicals and newspaper archives.", "query_goals": ["Identify specific publications or events referred to as 'The Paper'", "Narrow down search to focus on historical context around the year 1894", "Exclude unrelated types of 'paper' such as commercial or bathroom variants"], "node_classes": ["Publication/Event Title", "Release Year Context", "Type of Publication"], "query_nodes": ["The Paper", "1894", "publication"], "nearest_neighbors": ["historical periodicals", "newspaper archives 1894", "19th-century publications", "literary releases in the 1800s", "events related to media in 1894"], "augmented_query": "\"The Paper released in 1894 historical publication newspaper archives 19th-century\"", "ndcg": {"NDCG@10": 0.0, "NDCG@100": 0.16104, "NDCG@1000": 0.16104, "NDCG@10000": 0.16104}, "map": {"MAP@10": 0.0, "MAP@100": 0.0137, "MAP@1000": 0.0137, "MAP@10000": 0.0137}, "recall": {"Recall@10": 0.0, "Recall@100": 1.0, "Recall@1000": 1.0, "Recall@10000": 1.0}, "precision": {"P@10": 0.0, "P@100": 0.01, "P@1000": 0.001, "P@10000": 0.0001}, "delta": 0.011799999999999977, "instruction": "graph", "query": "The Paper was only released in 1894.", "query_id": "59903", "dataset": "fever", "generator_model": "ollama_chat/phi4:14b-q8_0", "temperature": 1.0}
