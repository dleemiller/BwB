{"reasoning": "The original query \"Nero is a person\" aims to retrieve information about Nero, specifically focusing on his identity as a historical figure\u2014more precisely, Emperor Nero of Rome. The mixed nature of search results indicates that while some documents are relevant by addressing Nero the emperor or associated context (like Villa of Nero), others diverge into areas not pertinent to this specific inquiry (such as media codecs and software companies). \n\nTo refine the search and focus on relevant historical content, we need to:\n1. Distinguish between various entities named \"Nero\" within different domains.\n2. Expand the query using terms that emphasize Nero's identity as a Roman emperor and his associated historical context.\n\n### Query Goals\nThe main goals are:\n- Isolate the results related specifically to Emperor Nero of Rome.\n- Enhance search specificity by incorporating relevant contextual terms that highlight Nero's life, reign, and historical impact.\n- Exclude results about modern companies or technology products named \"Nero.\"\n\n### Graph Construction\nConstruct a conceptual graph starting with Nero as a core node. The first-order connections relate to his biography (e.g., birth, death), reign (e.g., policies, notable events like the Great Fire of Rome), and relationships (e.g., family members). Second-order connections may include topics like Roman history, significant architectural projects during his rule, or cultural aspects of the Roman Empire.\n\n### Expansion Path Selection\nTo refine the search query effectively, we'll explore expansion paths that:\n- Emphasize synonymous terms for \"Emperor Nero\" (e.g., Nero Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus).\n- Use hierarchical connections to broader historical concepts (e.g., Julio-Claudian dynasty, Ancient Rome).\n- Consider compositional and contextual elements like \"Villa of Nero,\" which relates specifically to his architectural endeavors.\n\n### Term Extraction and Filtering\nExtract expansion terms that are highly relevant and specific. These should improve search results by focusing on historically pertinent information about Nero's life and reign while filtering out unrelated modern references.", "query_goals": ["Focus search results on Emperor Nero of Rome.", "Incorporate context-specific terms related to Nero's historical significance.", "Exclude irrelevant results regarding media or technology named 'Nero'."], "node_classes": ["Historical Figures", "Roman Emperors", "Biographical Information", "Ancient Roman Architecture", "Cultural Contexts", "Specific Historical Events", "Family and Relationships in History"], "query_nodes": ["Nero", "Emperor Nero of Rome", "Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus"], "nearest_neighbors": ["Julio-Claudian Dynasty", "Great Fire of Rome", "Villa of Nero", "Roman Empire", "Ancient Roman Culture", "Drusus Claudius Nero", "Nero's reign (54-68 AD)"], "augmented_query": "\"Nero emperor, Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus, Julio-Claudian dynasty, Great Fire of Rome, Villa of Nero\"", "ndcg": {"NDCG@10": 1.0, "NDCG@100": 1.0, "NDCG@1000": 1.0, "NDCG@10000": 1.0}, "map": {"MAP@10": 1.0, "MAP@100": 1.0, "MAP@1000": 1.0, "MAP@10000": 1.0}, "recall": {"Recall@10": 1.0, "Recall@100": 1.0, "Recall@1000": 1.0, "Recall@10000": 1.0}, "precision": {"P@10": 0.2, "P@100": 0.02, "P@1000": 0.002, "P@10000": 0.0002}, "delta": 0.22580999999999996, "instruction": "graph", "query": "Nero is a person.", "query_id": "85454", "dataset": "fever", "generator_model": "ollama_chat/phi4:14b-q8_0", "temperature": 1.0}
