{"reasoning": "The query focuses on the reevaluation of policies established based on earlier climate model outputs and predictions. Current search results are too broad, focusing on the climate models themselves and general policy responses. The goal is to identify documents discussing specific examples of policies formed from previous climate models, particularly those facing scrutiny or calls for revision due to updated model outputs or a better understanding of climate science, model limitations, and predictive uncertainty.
