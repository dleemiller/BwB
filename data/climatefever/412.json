{"reasoning": "The query seeks to link a specific warming period (1970-1998) with the emergence of the global warming alarmist movement. The current results fall short by not making this explicit link. To address this gap, we'll create user personas with varying levels of understanding of climate science and motivations for researching this period. We'll then map their potential search terms and information needs across their learning journey, considering different usage scenarios and intents. Finally, we'll extract key terms to augment the query, aiming to surface content that directly connects the warming period with the rise of climate change awareness or activism, and specifically whether the warming trend was a catalyst.", "user_personas": ["Climate Science Novice: Interested in learning the basics of climate change and its history.", "Climate Policy Analyst: Investigating the historical context of climate policy and activism.", "Climate Change Skeptic: Questioning the scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate change and seeking evidence of natural variability.", "Environmental Historian: Researching the evolution of environmental movements and the role of scientific data in shaping public perception."], "search_vocabulary": ["climate change 1970s 1990s", "global warming alarmism origins", "temperature increase late 20th century", "Hansen climate models controversy", "climate change activism 1990s", "global warming scare timeline", "natural climate variability vs human caused", "hockey stick graph criticism", "environmental movement history temperature", "media coverage global warming 1990s", "Climategate", "IPCC reports early years impact", "anthropogenic climate change debate start", "early climate models accuracy"], "journey_stages": ["Basic understanding of climate change -> Learning about specific warming periods -> Understanding the context of the 1970-1998 warming -> Exploring the rise of climate change awareness -> Analyzing the role of scientific data in activism.", "Initial search about climate -> Finding temperature records -> Connecting specific events to warming period -> Exploring the alarmist movement's origin -> Critically assessing the science and data.", "Awareness of climate change issue -> Desire for data/info to argue against climate change -> Investigate time periods where warming occurred naturally -> Search for alternative explanations -> Seeking flaws in research or data.", "Interested in environment history -> timeline of global warming movement -> what events triggered alarmism -> scientific evidence at the time -> political response"], "usage_scenarios": ["Writing a blog post about the history of climate change activism.", "Developing a climate change curriculum for high school students.", "Preparing a presentation on the scientific evidence for climate change.", "Debating the merits of different climate change policies.", "Evaluating the accuracy of early climate models.", "Gathering resources and facts for a debate on climate change.", "Building an understanding of the history behind the current movement.", "Investigating if the science lines up with alarmist claims in the 90's."], "intent_terms": ["historical context", "origins", "scientific basis", "natural variability", "media influence", "political impact", "alarmism", "skepticism", "evidence", "trigger", "catalyst", "motivating factors", "rise of activism", "public perception", "scientific consensus", "early climate models", "anthropogenic influence"], "augmented_query": "\"1970-1998 warming period AND (climate change OR global warming) AND (origins OR rise OR catalyst) AND (alarmism OR activism OR awareness) AND (scientific basis OR public perception OR political impact)\"", "ndcg": {"NDCG@10": 0.15643, "NDCG@100": 0.15643, "NDCG@1000": 0.25516, "NDCG@10000": 0.25516}, "map": {"MAP@10": 0.04762, "MAP@100": 0.04762, "MAP@1000": 0.04987, "MAP@10000": 0.04987}, "recall": {"Recall@10": 0.33333, "Recall@100": 0.33333, "Recall@1000": 1.0, "Recall@10000": 1.0}, "precision": {"P@10": 0.1, "P@100": 0.01, "P@1000": 0.003, "P@10000": 0.0003}, "delta": 0.05535999999999999, "instruction": "journey", "query": "From 1970 until 1998 there was a warming period that raised temperatures by about 0.7 F that helped spawn the global warming alarmist movement.", "query_id": "412", "dataset": "climatefever", "generator_model": "openrouter/google/gemini-2.0-flash-001", "temperature": 1.0}
