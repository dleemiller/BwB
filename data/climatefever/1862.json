{"reasoning": "The task is to expand the query \"Carbon dioxide is not 'a primary contributor to the global warming that we see.'\" by identifying semantically relevant terms. The original documents mainly support the established view of CO2 as a significant factor in global warming, lacking alternative perspectives or counterarguments which the user might be seeking.\n\n1. **Query Analysis**: The core query challenges the widely accepted position regarding CO2's role in climate change. It implies a search for evidence or theories that either downplay CO2\u2019s impact or emphasize other factors contributing to global warming.\n   \n2. **Graph Construction**: \n   - Core nodes: Carbon dioxide, global warming, primary contributor\n   - First-order connections include greenhouse gases (e.g., methane, nitrous oxide), human activities (e.g., industrialization, deforestation)\n   - Second-order connections: climate change skeptics' arguments, other causes of temperature rise (e.g., solar radiation variations, volcanic activity)\n   - Domain contexts: Climatology, environmental policy, energy sector\n\n3. **Expansion Path Selection**: \n   - Synonymous terms and broader/narrower concepts related to global warming.\n   - Compositional and contextual terms examining different contributing factors or alternate explanations.\n   - Domain-specific terminology exploring climate change debates.\n\n4. **Term Extraction and Filtering**: Focused on terms that provide alternative viewpoints, other greenhouse gases, natural contributors to temperature changes, and areas of contention within the climate science community.", "query_goals": ["Identify evidence questioning CO2's primary role in global warming.", "Explore theories or data highlighting other factors contributing to global warming.", "Incorporate alternative scientific perspectives or debates about climate change causes."], "node_classes": ["Core Concepts", "First-order Connections", "Second-order Connections", "Domain Contexts"], "query_nodes": ["Carbon dioxide", "Global warming", "Primary contributor"], "nearest_neighbors": ["Greenhouse gases", "Methane", "Nitrous oxide", "Solar radiation", "Volcanic activity", "Climate skeptics", "Temperature rise", "Industrialization", "Deforestation", "Alternative explanations for climate change"], "augmented_query": "\"Carbon dioxide is not 'a primary contributor to the global warming that we see.'
