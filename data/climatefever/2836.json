{"reasoning": "The query focuses on the rebound of global sea ice levels, specifically mentioning a comparison to 1979. To provide a comprehensive response, we need to analyze the historical context of sea ice fluctuations, including glacial cycles, post-glacial rebound, and factors influencing sea level changes.
