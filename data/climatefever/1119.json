{"reasoning": "The original query focuses on Prof. Adam Scaife's statement regarding the link between shrinking Arctic ice and climate change, emphasizing his expertise and evidence supporting this claim. To enhance the search results for a community Q&A context like Quora, it is essential to explore how users might naturally expand or reframe their queries based on personal experiences, advice needs, opinion requests, comparisons, and stories related to the topic. Additionally, understanding the hidden motivations of the askers can guide the augmentation process by revealing what deeper insights or support they are seeking. The document types reveal strengths in scientific credibility and climate data relevance but weaknesses in off-topic energy reports and controversies.
