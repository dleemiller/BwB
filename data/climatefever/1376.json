{"reasoning": "The query asks about periods within the last 10,000 years when the planet was significantly warmer than today. The existing results are weak because they either focus on events far outside this time frame (e.g., PETM) or are only tangentially related to the core concept of sustained warmth within the specified timeframe (e.g., January thaw, marine regression). To address this, I need to focus the query on the Holocene epoch (the last 11,700 years) and look for specific warm periods or events within it.
