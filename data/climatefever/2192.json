{"reasoning": "The task involves creating a conceptual map centered around the idea that solar activity influences global climate, particularly contributing to warming. The central concept revolves around understanding both natural (solar activity) and anthropogenic factors in global climate change dynamics.\n\nTo accomplish this, we must:\n1. Identify central coordinates, placing emphasis on scientific consensus regarding solar activity's role compared to human-induced factors.\n2. Chart boundary areas by exploring how related disciplines such as geoengineering interact with these climatic processes.\n3. Highlight key landmarks, including major research institutions and authoritative reports like IPCC assessments that shape our understanding of climate change mechanisms.\n4. Map detail features, which include specific scientific metrics used in measuring solar activity and methodologies for analyzing its impact on climate.\n5. Develop a navigation lexicon that can help researchers or students explore the complexities of this interdisciplinary field.", "central_coordinates": ["Solar Activity Impact", "Global Climate Change", "Anthropogenic Factors"], "boundary_areas": ["Geoengineering Efforts", "Urban Heat Islands Studies", "Renewable Energy Impacts on Climate", "Atmospheric Science Disciplines", "Environmental Policy and Regulation"], "key_landmarks": ["IPCC Assessment Reports", "NASA Solar Radiation Research", "NOAA Climate Monitoring Programs", "Intergovernmental Climate Conferences (e.g., COP)", "Leading Climate Change Research Universities"], "detail_features": ["Solar Irradiance Measurements", "Carbon Dioxide Emission Metrics", "Earth System Models (ESMs)", "Historical Climate Data Analysis", "Satellite Observations of Solar Phenomena"], "navigation_terms": ["Solar Cycle Variability", "Climate Sensitivity", "Radiative Forcing", "Mitigation Strategies", "Greenhouse Gas Inventories", "Paleoclimatology", "Atmospheric Physics", "Emissions Scenarios"], "augmented_query": "\"Solar activity and its influence on global climate warming: comparative analysis with anthropogenic factors, IPCC reports, geoengineering implications, atmospheric science insights\"", "ndcg": {"NDCG@10": 0.11305, "NDCG@100": 0.11305, "NDCG@1000": 0.24916, "NDCG@10000": 0.27808}, "map": {"MAP@10": 0.02857, "MAP@100": 0.02857, "MAP@1000": 0.03844, "MAP@10000": 0.03873}, "recall": {"Recall@10": 0.2, "Recall@100": 0.2, "Recall@1000": 0.8, "Recall@10000": 1.0}, "precision": {"P@10": 0.1, "P@100": 0.01, "P@1000": 0.004, "P@10000": 0.0005}, "delta": 0.05345, "instruction": "cartography", "query": "The data suggests solar activity is influencing the global climate causing the world to get warmer.\"", "query_id": "2192", "dataset": "climatefever", "generator_model": "ollama_chat/phi4:14b-q8_0", "temperature": 1.0}
