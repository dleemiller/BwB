{"reasoning": "The query addresses a debate over job dynamics in the alternative energy sector, specifically challenging a claim about job losses relative to new jobs created. The analysis should encompass economic theories around employment impacts of industry shifts, labor market adjustments due to technology and innovation, and empirical studies examining real-world outcomes in sectors similar to alternative energy.\n\nTo explore this query effectively, it's crucial to map out the conceptual territory by first identifying central aspects related to job creation and destruction within alternative energy. The document types provided (Economic theory, Alternative Medicine, Employment & Labor) suggest a focus on economic analysis of employment impacts, with 'Alternative Medicine' being less relevant due to its non-alignment with the core topic.\n\n1. **Central Coordinates**: These are primarily focused on economic theories about job creation/destruction and empirical analyses in labor markets.\n2. **Boundary Exploration** includes examining related fields such as technological innovation impacts, policy influences on employment, and historical case studies of industry transitions.\n3. **Landmark Identification** involves pinpointing seminal studies or theories, notable industry reports, and key legislative or regulatory frameworks affecting the alternative energy sector's labor market.\n4. **Detail Mapping** requires diving into specific methodologies used in economic analyses (e.g., job multipliers), nuances within employment statistics, and comparisons with similar historical industrial shifts.\n5. **Cartographic Legend**: This includes terms critical to understanding the debate on employment impacts such as 'job displacement', 'economic transition', 'multiplier effect', and 'structural unemployment'.\n\nThe central coordinates, boundary areas, key landmarks, detailed features, navigation terms, and augmented query aim to provide a comprehensive exploration of how claims about job dynamics in alternative energy industries can be critically examined using these mapped concepts.", "central_coordinates": ["Economic theory on job creation/destruction", "Empirical employment studies in the energy sector", "Labor market impacts of technological innovation"], "boundary_areas": ["Technological change and labor demand", "Policy impact on industry transition", "Historical industrial shifts affecting employment", "Comparative analysis with fossil fuel industries"], "key_landmarks": ["Seminal economic theories on structural unemployment", "Notable studies challenging job displacement claims in energy transitions", "Regulatory frameworks influencing alternative energy markets", "Real-world examples of employment patterns in renewable sectors"], "detail_features": ["Job multiplier effect methodologies", "Statistical nuances in employment reporting for alternative vs. conventional energy sectors", "Case studies from regions with significant renewable energy adoption", "Analysis of job quality and skill requirements transition"], "navigation_terms": ["Job displacement", "Economic transition effects", "Multiplier effect", "Structural unemployment", "Labor market adjustment", "Renewable energy sector employment"], "augmented_query": "\"Examining the economic theory behind job creation/destruction in alternative energy, with a focus on empirical studies and labor market impacts of technological innovation; analyzing policy impact on industry transition and historical industrial shifts affecting employment.\"", "ndcg": {"NDCG@10": 0.14607, "NDCG@100": 0.20326, "NDCG@1000": 0.28573, "NDCG@10000": 0.31688}, "map": {"MAP@10": 0.05, "MAP@100": 0.05667, "MAP@1000": 0.06131, "MAP@10000": 0.06184}, "recall": {"Recall@10": 0.2, "Recall@100": 0.4, "Recall@1000": 0.8, "Recall@10000": 1.0}, "precision": {"P@10": 0.1, "P@100": 0.02, "P@1000": 0.004, "P@10000": 0.0005}, "delta": 0.0036800000000000166, "instruction": "cartography", "query": "The claim that 2.2 conventional jobs are destroyed   for  every new job created in the alternative energy industry is based on a study which relies on incorrect numbers, cherrypicked dates, faulty theory, flawed methodology, and is disproven by real-world examples.", "query_id": "3066", "dataset": "climatefever", "generator_model": "ollama_chat/phi4:14b-q8_0", "temperature": 1.0}
