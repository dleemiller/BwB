{"reasoning": "The query is about 'clean coal' and its carbon capture and storage method. The document types are informational articles and technical websites. The strengths are accurate definitions and descriptions of technologies. The weaknesses are a lack of diverse perspectives on practicality, effectiveness, viability, and cost.\n\nThe primary goals are to find documents that provide:\n1. Alternative viewpoints on clean coal's effectiveness and feasibility.\n2. Up-to-date information on project status and cost.\n3. Critiques of the technology.\n\nI will expand the query with terms related to:\n1. Alternative names for the process and technology.\n2. The economics associated with it.\n3. The actual impact of the technology if implemented.\nThis should lead to more recent and diverse information on the topic.", "query_goals": ["Find alternative viewpoints on clean coal's effectiveness and feasibility.", "Find up-to-date information on project status and cost.", "Find critiques of the technology."], "node_classes": ["Energy Technology", "Environmental Issue", "Climate Change Mitigation", "Geological Storage", "Power Generation", "Economic Feasibility", "Policy and Regulation"], "query_nodes": ["Clean Coal", "Carbon Capture", "Carbon Storage", "CCS", "Power Plants", "Emissions"], "nearest_neighbors": ["Carbon Sequestration", "Underground Injection", "Enhanced Oil Recovery", "Coal Gasification", "Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC)", "Fossil Fuel Power Generation", "Environmental Impact Assessment", "Climate Policy", "Cost-Benefit Analysis", "Renewable Energy Alternatives"], "augmented_query": "\"clean coal\" OR \"carbon capture and storage\" OR CCS OR \"carbon sequestration\" OR \"underground injection\" AND (\"economic viability\" OR \"cost effectiveness\" OR \"environmental impact\" OR \"project status\" OR \"feasibility studies\" OR \"climate policy implications\" OR \"lifecycle assessment\" OR \"environmental risk assessment\" OR \"renewable energy alternatives\") AND (criticism OR \"challenges\" OR \"drawbacks\" OR \"limitations\" OR \"controversies\")", "ndcg": {"NDCG@10": 0.76536, "NDCG@100": 0.84513, "NDCG@1000": 0.84513, "NDCG@10000": 0.84513}, "map": {"MAP@10": 0.66667, "MAP@100": 0.68391, "MAP@1000": 0.68391, "MAP@10000": 0.68391}, "recall": {"Recall@10": 0.66667, "Recall@100": 1.0, "Recall@1000": 1.0, "Recall@10000": 1.0}, "precision": {"P@10": 0.2, "P@100": 0.03, "P@1000": 0.003, "P@10000": 0.0003}, "delta": 0.017900000000000027, "instruction": "graph", "query": "\u2018Clean coal\u2019 is an approach in which the emissions from coal-burning power plants would be captured and pumped underground.", "query_id": "791", "dataset": "climatefever", "generator_model": "openrouter/google/gemini-2.0-flash-001", "temperature": 1.0}
