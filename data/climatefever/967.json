{"reasoning": "The query examines the historical occurrence of warming-cooling cycles since 900AD, highlighting the need to identify climatic patterns over this time span. The available documents provide context on significant climate changes but do not specifically address frequent short-term cycles. To enrich our understanding and formulate an augmented query, we must trace back through known climatic events, recognize milestones that align with warming-cooling trends, and consider emerging research areas. This process involves leveraging historical data, recognizing key developments in climate science, and identifying contemporary terminologies used to describe similar phenomena.", "historical_foundation": ["Medieval Warm Period (approx. 950-1250 AD)", "Little Ice Age (approx. 1300-1850 AD)", "Early Anthropocene climatic influences", "Historical climate reconstructions from tree rings and ice cores"], "development_milestones": ["Establishment of paleoclimatology as a field in the early 20th century", "Advancements in radiocarbon dating techniques for precise historical climate analysis", "Discovery of solar cycles influencing climatic patterns", "Development of climate models incorporating human and natural factors"], "current_landscape": ["Use of satellite data to monitor real-time climate change impacts", "Integration of machine learning algorithms in predicting short-term climate variations", "Focus on understanding regional climate phenomena like the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO)", "Emphasis on climate resilience and adaptation strategies"], "emerging_trends": ["Development of high-resolution paleoclimate datasets for finer temporal analysis", "Incorporation of AI to simulate potential future warming-cooling cycles", "Increased focus on the impacts of aerosols and other atmospheric constituents", "Expansion of interdisciplinary approaches, linking climatology with socio-economic studies"], "temporal_terms": ["Medieval Warm Period", "Little Ice Age", "Paleoclimatology", "Radiocarbon dating", "Solar cycles", "Anthropocene influences", "Satellite climate monitoring", "Machine learning climate models", "Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO)", "High-resolution paleoclimate datasets"], "augmented_query": "\"Warming-cooling cycles since 900AD, Medieval Warm Period, Little Ice Age, solar influence on climate patterns, early Anthropocene climatic impacts, radiocarbon dating for historical climates\"", "ndcg": {"NDCG@10": 0.46928, "NDCG@100": 0.54038, "NDCG@1000": 0.60845, "NDCG@10000": 0.60845}, "map": {"MAP@10": 0.33333, "MAP@100": 0.34028, "MAP@1000": 0.34875, "MAP@10000": 0.34875}, "recall": {"Recall@10": 0.33333, "Recall@100": 0.66667, "Recall@1000": 1.0, "Recall@10000": 1.0}, "precision": {"P@10": 0.1, "P@100": 0.02, "P@1000": 0.003, "P@10000": 0.0003}, "delta": 0.41271, "instruction": "timetravel", "query": "He said: \u2018We have had five warming cycles since about 900AD, each followed by a dramatic cooling cycle.\u2019", "query_id": "967", "dataset": "climatefever", "generator_model": "ollama_chat/phi4:14b-q8_0", "temperature": 1.0}
