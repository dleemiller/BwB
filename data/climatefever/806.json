{"reasoning": "The documents available primarily focus on historical heatwave data for specific North American regions, but they do not cover the exact events mentioned in the query. To overcome this gap and generate relevant insights, metaphorical thinking can be utilized to conceptually connect broader climate patterns with known events. By generating metaphors from various domains\u2014like nature or mechanics\u2014we can find common threads that help us think about heatwaves in new ways. This process can lead to extracting terms across these domains that might uncover hidden aspects of the phenomena described, allowing for a more enriched and informed augmented query.", "generated_metaphors": ["A heatwave as a relentless dragon breathing fire over landscapes, reducing moisture and energy.", "Heatwaves acting like an unchecked oven on high, baking the land without respite.", "The climate system is a delicate symphony where heatwaves represent dissonant chords disrupting harmony.", "Heatwaves are like invasive species of warmth that colonize regions not accustomed to such temperatures.", "A heatwave is a relentless marathon runner overtaking all regional climates in a race towards extremes."], "domain_mappings": ["Dragon: fierce, consuming energy and resources; Heatwave: intense temperature rise.", "Oven: control of heat levels over time; Heatwave: uncontrolled prolonged high temperatures.", "Symphony: coordinated elements creating harmony; Climate system: interdependent weather patterns.", "Invasive species: disrupt natural ecosystems; Unusual warmth: alters typical climate balance.", "Marathon runner: sustained pace, endurance challenge; Extreme temperature duration."], "metaphorical_language": ["Breathing fire, relentless heat, consuming landscapes", "Unchecked high temperatures, baking the land", "Dissonant chords, climatic harmony disruption", "Colonizing warmth, invasive presence in ecosystems", "Overtaking climates, endurance extremes"], "extended_metaphors": ["The dragon's fiery breath leaves behind charred earth and withered life, akin to the ecological aftermath of severe heatwaves.", "As an oven\u2019s temperature builds steadily over time, so do heatwave conditions accumulate without relief.", "Just as dissonant chords can change a symphony's mood, unexpected climatic shifts alter regional weather patterns.", "Invasive species transform habitats; similarly, prolonged warmth changes natural climates and ecological dynamics.", "Like an endurance runner facing fatigue, regions suffer long-term impacts from sustained extreme temperatures."], "cross_domain_terms": ["Dragon's fiery aftermath", "Unchecked oven settings", "Climatic dissonance", "Invasive warm species", "Endurance extremes", "Ecological transformation"], "augmented_query": "Significant heatwave events in the Mountain West during early July and over the Pacific Northwest in early August, with emphasis on ecological impacts, regional climate disruptions, prolonged temperature anomalies, and historical comparisons to similar intense weather phenomena.", "ndcg": {"NDCG@10": 0.26407, "NDCG@100": 0.26407, "NDCG@1000": 0.33662, "NDCG@10000": 0.33662}, "map": {"MAP@10": 0.125, "MAP@100": 0.125, "MAP@1000": 0.12787, "MAP@10000": 0.12787}, "recall": {"Recall@10": 0.5, "Recall@100": 0.5, "Recall@1000": 1.0, "Recall@10000": 1.0}, "precision": {"P@10": 0.1, "P@100": 0.01, "P@1000": 0.002, "P@10000": 0.0002}, "delta": 0.11023999999999998, "instruction": "metaphor", "query": "Days of near-100-degree-Fahrenheit temperatures cooked the Mountain West in early July, and a scorching heat wave lingered over the Pacific Northwest in early August.\u201d", "query_id": "806", "dataset": "climatefever", "generator_model": "ollama_chat/phi4:14b-q8_0", "temperature": 1.0}
