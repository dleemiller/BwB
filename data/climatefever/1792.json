{"reasoning": "The goal is to expand the search query related to Greenland's ice loss and its contribution to sea level rise by understanding different user intents and contexts. We begin by creating distinct personas, each with unique backgrounds and motivations, influencing how they seek information. This approach allows us to map out varied vocabulary needs, understand progression in their knowledge journey from novice to expert levels, identify specific scenarios where such information is critical, and ultimately enhance the search query with diverse terms that reflect these user intents. By doing so, we ensure the augmented query encompasses a broader spectrum of relevant results across document types like scientific studies and reports.", "user_personas": ["Eco-Conscious Novice: An individual newly aware of climate change impacts, looking for simple explanations of Greenland's ice melt.", "Policy Maker Intermediate: A government official seeking reliable data to inform environmental policies, focusing on projected impacts over the coming decades.", "Climate Scientist Advanced: A researcher with a strong background in climatology analyzing recent scientific studies about ice sheet dynamics and future projections.", "NGO Leader Expert: An expert deeply involved in advocacy work, aiming to use comprehensive scientific evidence to drive global policy change regarding climate adaptation."], "search_vocabulary": ["What is Greenland's ice loss?", "How much sea level rise from Greenland?", "Greenland glacier melt impact on oceans", "Scientific studies Greenland ice sheets melting trends", "Current projections of Greenland ice sheet contribution to sea level rise", "Climate change impact reports Greenland 2023"], "journey_stages": ["Introduction: Understanding basic concepts such as 'ice loss', 'sea level rise', and why they matter.", "Early Learning: Acquiring specific data on Greenland's contributions and the timeline for sea level changes.", "Intermediate Knowledge: Comprehending scientific methods used in studies and their implications.", "Advanced Insights: Evaluating projections and modeling scenarios from leading climate reports like IPCC and NOAA.", "Expert Mastery: Synthesizing complex information into advocacy or policy recommendations."], "usage_scenarios": ["A student researching a school project on current global environmental issues.", "A government official preparing for an international climate summit needing up-to-date data.", "A scientist conducting research that requires the latest findings on polar ice dynamics.", "An NGO strategist developing materials to educate and mobilize communities around climate action."], "intent_terms": ["global warming", "climate change effects", "IPCC report sea level rise", "NOAA projections for oceans", "greenland ice melt consequences", "sea level rise impact studies"], "augmented_query": "Greenland's ice loss is accelerating & will add meters of sea level rise in upcoming centuries.
