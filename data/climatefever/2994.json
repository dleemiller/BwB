{"reasoning": "The query centers around Mauna Loa's historical CO2 data, its implications on climate change, and its relation to Manning's goals. The current document set provides solid scientific data but lacks a direct link to \"Manning's predetermined goal.\" To address this gap, we should consider user personas at various expertise levels who might search for related information.\n\n- **User Personas:** Develop personas that span from novices seeking basic understanding of CO2 measurements to experts looking into the technicalities and implications. Each persona has distinct goals: learning, analyzing trends, policy-making, or advocacy.\n  \n- **Search Vocabulary Analysis:** Identify the natural language variations each persona might use at different stages of their information journey. Novices might begin with general terms, while experts may delve into specialized scientific jargon.\n\n- **Journey Stages Mapping:** Outline how user understanding progresses from basic curiosity about CO2 levels to intricate analyses and policy discussions.\n\n- **Usage Scenarios:** Explore scenarios where users need this data\u2014education, research, policymaking\u2014and adapt the search vocabulary accordingly.\n\n- **Intent-Based Term Extraction:** Focus on high-value terms reflecting diverse intents like learning about CO2 trends or exploring environmental policies related to climate change.\n\nBy expanding the query through these lenses, we aim to enhance retrieval by capturing varied user needs and terminologies at different stages of their information journey.", "user_personas": ["Novice Learner: Interested in basic understanding of atmospheric CO2 levels and climate change.", "Curious Student: Seeking detailed historical data on Mauna Loa's CO2 measurements for an academic project.", "Environmental Analyst: Analyzing CO2 trends for research or reports, aiming to understand climate implications.", "Climate Policy Expert: Exploring the role of historic CO2 data in shaping environmental policies and strategies."], "search_vocabulary": ["What is Mauna Loa CO2 record?", "CO2 atmospheric concentration history", "Mauna Loa carbon dioxide measurement significance", "Impact of Mauna Loa CO2 data on climate policy", "Historical trends in CO2 emissions", "Manning's goal related to CO2 monitoring"], "journey_stages": ["Entry Point: What is atmospheric CO2?", "Intermediate Learning: How does Mauna Loa measure CO2?", "Advanced Understanding: Implications of steady CO2 increase since 1959.", "Expert Exploration: Analyzing data for climate policy development."], "usage_scenarios": ["A student creating a presentation on historical atmospheric CO2 trends.", "A researcher compiling data to support climate change studies.", "Policy maker assessing historic CO2 data for future environmental strategies.", "Advocacy group using Mauna Loa's data in awareness campaigns."], "intent_terms": ["CO2 concentration trends", "Mauna Loa Observatory significance", "historical CO2 data impact", "Manning and climate goals", "climate policy implications", "environmental strategies based on CO2 records"], "augmented_query": "'Mauna Loa historical CO2 measurement, atmospheric CO2 concentration trends since 1959, significance of Mauna Loa CO2 record, implications for climate change understanding, Manning's goal and environmental strategy development'", "ndcg": {"NDCG@10": 0.63668, "NDCG@100": 0.71004, "NDCG@1000": 0.75975, "NDCG@10000": 0.75975}, "map": {"MAP@10": 0.5, "MAP@100": 0.51923, "MAP@1000": 0.52358, "MAP@10000": 0.52358}, "recall": {"Recall@10": 0.5, "Recall@100": 0.75, "Recall@1000": 1.0, "Recall@10000": 1.0}, "precision": {"P@10": 0.2, "P@100": 0.03, "P@1000": 0.004, "P@10000": 0.0004}, "delta": 0.05514000000000008, "instruction": "journey", "query": "'Mauna Loa has been producing a readout which supports Manning's predetermined goal by showing steady growth in atmospheric CO2 concentrations since 1959.", "query_id": "2994", "dataset": "climatefever", "generator_model": "ollama_chat/phi4:14b-q8_0", "temperature": 1.0}
