{"reasoning": "The query \"Sea ice has diminished much faster than scientists and climate models anticipated\" seeks to explore discrepancies between expected and observed rates of sea ice decline. The primary search intent appears informational, aiming to understand why current observations outpace scientific predictions.\n\n**Reasoning Breakdown:**\n\n1. **Core Concepts and Search Intent**: \n   - **Core Concepts**: Sea ice decline, scientific anticipation (or models), observed rate versus predicted rate.\n   - **Search Intent**: Informational; the user seeks detailed insights into why sea ice is disappearing faster than expected, including explanations from scientific reports, research findings on climate dynamics, and measurement methodologies.\n\n2. **Graph Construction**:\n   - **Core Nodes**: \"Sea ice decline,\" \"scientific models/predictions,\" \"observation methods.\"\n   - **First-Order Connections**: \"Climate change factors\" (e.g., greenhouse gas emissions), \"satellite observation techniques.\"\n   - **Second-Order Connections**: \"Arctic temperature changes,\" \"impact on ecosystems,\" \"policy implications.\"\n   - **Domain Contexts**: Climate science, polar research, environmental policy.\n\n3. **Expansion Path Selection**:\n   - **Synonymous Terms**: Terms like \"ice sheet retreat\" can be synonymous.\n   - **Hierarchical Terms**: Broader terms such as \"climate change effects\" and narrower ones like \"Arctic ice thickness.\"\n   - **Compositional Terms**: Components like \"albedo effect,\" \"thermal expansion.\"\n   - **Contextual Terms**: Contexts including \"impact on polar bears,\" or scenarios like \"ice-free Arctic summer.\"\n   - **Domain-Specific Terminology**: Specialized terms such as \"cryosphere dynamics.\"\n\n4. **Term Extraction and Filtering**:\n   - Extracted high-value terms include \"albedo effect,\" \"Arctic amplification,\" \"greenhouse gas concentration,\" which maintain relevance, are distinctive from initial query, specific enough to add depth without being too general, and likely present in documents of the target domain.", "query_goals": ["Understand why sea ice is diminishing faster than models predict", "Explore scientific explanations for observed versus expected sea ice decline rates", "Investigate methodologies used for measuring sea ice extent and thickness", "Identify key climate factors influencing rapid Arctic sea ice loss"], "node_classes": ["Concepts", "Entities", "Processes", "Contextual Factors", "Methodologies"], "query_nodes": ["Sea Ice Decline", "Scientific Models/Predictions", "Observation Methods", "Climate Change"], "nearest_neighbors": ["Arctic Amplification", "Albedo Effect", "Greenhouse Gas Concentration", "Satellite Observation Techniques", "Ice Thickness Measurement", "Polar Research Dynamics"], "augmented_query": "Sea ice has diminished much faster than scientists and climate models anticipated, involving factors like Arctic amplification, albedo effect, greenhouse gas concentration, and satellite observation techniques.", "ndcg": {"NDCG@10": 0.5414, "NDCG@100": 0.65029, "NDCG@1000": 0.69325, "NDCG@10000": 0.69325}, "map": {"MAP@10": 0.35, "MAP@100": 0.41818, "MAP@1000": 0.42002, "MAP@10000": 0.42002}, "recall": {"Recall@10": 0.5, "Recall@100": 0.75, "Recall@1000": 1.0, "Recall@10000": 1.0}, "precision": {"P@10": 0.2, "P@100": 0.03, "P@1000": 0.004, "P@10000": 0.0004}, "delta": 0.01036999999999999, "instruction": "graph", "query": "Sea ice has diminished much faster than scientists and climate models anticipated.", "query_id": "971", "dataset": "climatefever", "generator_model": "ollama_chat/phi4:14b-q8_0", "temperature": 1.0}
