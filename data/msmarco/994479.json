{"reasoning": "The core query seeks to identify health care systems that provide all citizens with equal access to health care services. This inquiry implies a search for universal health coverage models and how various countries achieve (or struggle to achieve) equal access to healthcare. The current results provide a sense of existing systems such as Poland's publicly funded model and specific programs like Medicaid in Ohio; however, they may lack a comprehensive international perspective or a discussion on various models outside the examples given. The strengths lie in offering a broad understanding of certain systems, while weaknesses include limited coverage of global perspectives and critical analysis on achieving true equality in access. Addressing these gaps involves exploring a wider array of models, legal frameworks, and the practicalities of implementation across demographics and regions.", "query_goals": ["Identify healthcare systems that provide equal access to all citizens.", "Understand the underlying policies, frameworks, and models enabling universal healthcare access.", "Explore the strengths and limitations of different healthcare systems in delivering equal access.", "Investigate real-world applications and challenges in achieving universal coverage.", "Identify concrete examples and case studies from multiple countries."], "important_events": ["World Health Organization's (WHO) publication of the Universal Health Coverage report.", "Implementation and evolution of the Affordable Care Act in the United States.", "Adoption of universal healthcare in countries like the UK, Canada, and Sweden.", "Global health movements advocating for universal coverage.", "Policy reforms in countries transitioning to universal healthcare."], "questions": ["Which countries have successfully implemented universal health coverage?", "What are the comparative benefits and challenges of different healthcare models?", "How do legal and policy frameworks support or hinder equal access?", "What are the key ingredients of a successful universal healthcare system?", "How do healthcare systems address the needs of marginalized or vulnerable populations?"], "headlines": ["Understanding the Pillars of Universal Health Coverage in Europe", "Comparative Success: Universal Healthcare Systems Around the World", "Beyond Borders: How Legal Frameworks Shape Universal Health Access", "Challenges and Triumphs in Providing Universal Health in the United States", "A Global Look at Healthcare Equality: Lessons from Sweden's System", "Innovative Policies and Practices in Achieving Equal Health Access in Low-Income Countries", "Implementing Universal Health Coverage: Case Studies from New Zealand and Taiwan"], "extracted_terms": ["Universal Health Coverage", "WHO Universal Health Coverage report", "Affordable Care Act", "Comparative healthcare models", "Legal frameworks for universal access", "Marginalized populations in healthcare", "policy reforms", "healthcare equality", "New Zealand health system", "Taiwan health system"], "augmented_query": "Which health care system provides all citizens or residents with equal access to health care services, focusing on universal health coverage models, comparative healthcare systems, legal frameworks, and addressing needs of marginalized populations in systems like the UK, Canada, or Sweden?", "ndcg": {"NDCG@10": 1.0, "NDCG@100": 1.0, "NDCG@1000": 1.0, "NDCG@10000": 1.0}, "map": {"MAP@10": 1.0, "MAP@100": 1.0, "MAP@1000": 1.0, "MAP@10000": 1.0}, "recall": {"Recall@10": 1.0, "Recall@100": 1.0, "Recall@1000": 1.0, "Recall@10000": 1.0}, "precision": {"P@10": 0.1, "P@100": 0.01, "P@1000": 0.001, "P@10000": 0.0001}, "delta": 0.5, "instruction": "headline", "query": "which health care system provides all citizens or residents with equal access to health care services", "query_id": "994479", "dataset": "msmarco"}
