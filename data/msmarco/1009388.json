{"reasoning": "To explore 'what's right in health care,' we must map its conceptual territory by establishing a center point that considers legal, ethical, and human rights dimensions of healthcare. The central coordinates are legal frameworks and human rights, with cardinal directions towards ethical debates and practical healthcare delivery. The scale should balance between detailed legal requirements and broader human rights perspectives. Boundaries will explore legal jurisdictions, ethical implications, and healthcare systems' comparisons. Key landmarks include international declarations, major legal statutes, and key ethical bodies. Detail mapping focuses on specific rights like access, quality, and accountability. The navigation terms are critical for understanding and navigating the terrain, guiding users from broad concepts to specific applications.", "central_coordinates": ["Legal frameworks and rights", "Human rights in healthcare", "Ethical principles"], "boundary_areas": ["Comparative healthcare systems", "Ethical debates and philosophical arguments", "Regional healthcare policies"], "key_landmarks": ["Universal Declaration of Human Rights", "HIPAA regulations", "World Health Organization guidelines"], "detail_features": ["Patient rights", "Accountability in healthcare delivery", "Access to essential medicines"], "navigation_terms": ["Healthcare equity", "Patient autonomy", "Regulatory compliance", "Cross-border healthcare policies"], "augmented_query": "what's right in healthcare including legal frameworks, human rights, ethical principles, international declarations, and practical implications", "ndcg": {"NDCG@10": 0.0, "NDCG@100": 0.26265, "NDCG@1000": 0.26265, "NDCG@10000": 0.26265}, "map": {"MAP@10": 0.0, "MAP@100": 0.07692, "MAP@1000": 0.07692, "MAP@10000": 0.07692}, "recall": {"Recall@10": 0.0, "Recall@100": 1.0, "Recall@1000": 1.0, "Recall@10000": 1.0}, "precision": {"P@10": 0.0, "P@100": 0.01, "P@1000": 0.001, "P@10000": 0.0001}, "delta": 0.09336, "instruction": "cartography", "query": "what's right in health care", "query_id": "1009388", "dataset": "msmarco"}
