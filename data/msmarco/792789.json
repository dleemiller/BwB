{"reasoning": "To provide a temporal evolution analysis of \"rumination syndrome,\" I will explore the following:\n1.  **Historical Foundation:** The early understanding and naming of the condition, any historical figures associated with the initial descriptions.\n2.  **Developmental Milestones:** How the diagnostic criteria evolved (e.g., DSM-IV mentioned in document types) and how the understanding of underlying mechanisms changed over time. Any shifts in treatment approaches.\n3.  **Current Landscape:** Current diagnostic criteria (DSM-5), prevalent theories on etiology (behavioral, physiological), contemporary treatments (therapy, biofeedback).\n4.  **Emerging Trends:** Potential future research directions (e.g., the role of the microbiome), new therapeutic interventions, or refined diagnostic techniques.\n5.  **Temporal Term Extraction:** Based on the above, I'll identify search terms reflecting each of these temporal periods to augment the original query.", "historical_foundation": ["Early descriptions of regurgitation", "Descriptions pre-DSM", "Initial behavioral explanations"], "development_milestones": ["DSM-IV criteria", "Identification of physiological factors", "Behavioral therapy approaches", "Research into diaphragmatic breathing"], "current_landscape": ["DSM-5 criteria for Rumination Disorder", "Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)", "Diaphragmatic breathing techniques", "Biofeedback therapy", "Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) for related symptoms", "Role of esophageal manometry"], "emerging_trends": ["Gut-brain axis research", "Role of the microbiome", "Neuromodulation techniques", "Personalized treatment plans", "Digital health interventions for monitoring and therapy"], "temporal_terms": ["Regurgitation (historical term)", "Rumination Disorder (DSM-5)", "CBT", "Diaphragmatic Breathing", "Biofeedback", "Gut-Brain Axis", "Microbiome"], "augmented_query": "\"rumination syndrome\" OR \"Rumination Disorder\" OR \"regurgitation\" OR \"CBT\" OR \"Diaphragmatic Breathing\" OR \"Biofeedback\" OR \"Gut-Brain Axis\" OR \"Microbiome\"", "ndcg": {"NDCG@10": 1.0, "NDCG@100": 1.0, "NDCG@1000": 1.0, "NDCG@10000": 1.0}, "map": {"MAP@10": 1.0, "MAP@100": 1.0, "MAP@1000": 1.0, "MAP@10000": 1.0}, "recall": {"Recall@10": 1.0, "Recall@100": 1.0, "Recall@1000": 1.0, "Recall@10000": 1.0}, "precision": {"P@10": 0.1, "P@100": 0.01, "P@1000": 0.001, "P@10000": 0.0001}, "delta": 0.36907, "instruction": "timetravel", "query": "what is rumination syndrome", "query_id": "792789", "dataset": "msmarco"}
