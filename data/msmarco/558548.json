{"reasoning": "The query \"what are extenuating circumstances\" seeks to understand a legal concept. The initial results provide a good foundation by defining the term and offering examples.

To create a comprehensive conceptual map, we need to delve deeper into:\n\n* **Types of Circumstances:** What categories of situations qualify as extenuating? \n* **Legal Applications:** How do courts weigh extenuating circumstances in different cases (e.g., criminal sentencing, contract disputes)?\n* **Subjectivity and Interpretation:**  To what extent are extenuating circumstances subjective or influenced by the judge's discretion?", "central_coordinates": ["Extenuating Circumstances", "Legal Context"], "boundary_areas": ["Criminal Law", "Civil Law", "Jurisprudence", "Ethics"], "key_landmarks": ["Burden of Proof", "Mitigation", "Precedent", "Sentencing Guidelines"], "detail_features": ["Aggravating Factors", "Mitigating Factors", "Mens Rea", "Actus Reus", "Judicial Discretion"], "navigation_terms": ["Circumstances", "Evidence", "Legal Burden", "Justification", "Mitigation", "Precedent"], "augmented_query": "\"legal implications of extenuating circumstances in criminal sentencing\", \"case studies of extenuating circumstances in civil law\", \"ethical considerations surrounding judicial discretion in weighing extenuating factors\"", "ndcg": {"NDCG@10": 1.0, "NDCG@100": 1.0, "NDCG@1000": 1.0, "NDCG@10000": 1.0}, "map": {"MAP@10": 1.0, "MAP@100": 1.0, "MAP@1000": 1.0, "MAP@10000": 1.0}, "recall": {"Recall@10": 1.0, "Recall@100": 1.0, "Recall@1000": 1.0, "Recall@10000": 1.0}, "precision": {"P@10": 0.1, "P@100": 0.01, "P@1000": 0.001, "P@10000": 0.0001}, "delta": 0.56932, "instruction": "cartography", "query": "what are extenuating circumstances", "query_id": "558548", "generator_model": "gemma2:9b-instruct-q8_0", "temperature": 1.0, "source": "zeta-alpha-ai/NanoMSMARCO", "dataset": "msmarco"}
