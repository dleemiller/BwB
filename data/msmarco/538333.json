{"reasoning": "The original query seeks a clear understanding of the definition of voluntary muscles. The existing document types suggest an academic or educational context, which aligns with the need for detailed, scientifically accurate information. The current results provide a comprehensive look at voluntary muscles but lack focus and clarity due to information redundancy and verbosity. Thus, the augmentation requires emphasizing clarity, covering key aspects of voluntary muscles succinctly, and addressing misunderstandings by eliminating repetitive content. Recognizing core concepts and potential connections in a conceptual graph aids in pinpointing valuable expansion terms. These terms can enhance the search by covering synonyms, hierarchical terms, and domain-specific relevant aspects. The augmented query should secure relevant, concise results focused on the essence of voluntary muscles without redundant phrasing or excessive detail deviations.", "query_goals": ["Understand the clear definition of voluntary muscles.", "Distinguish voluntary muscles from other muscle types concisely.", "Identify examples and practical applications of voluntary muscles.", "Clarify biological distinctions between voluntary and involuntary muscles.", "Streamline information to avoid redundancy and enhance clarity."], "node_classes": ["Muscle Types", "Muscle Control", "Skeletal System", "Neurological Influence", "Muscle Examples"], "query_nodes": ["voluntary muscle", "definition", "striated muscle", "conscious control", "skeletal system"], "nearest_neighbors": ["skeletal muscle", "sarcoplasmic contraction", "neuromuscular junction", "voluntary movement", "myofibrils"], "augmented_query": "voluntary muscle definition in skeletal system striated muscle with conscious control distinguish from involuntary muscles examples neurology", "ndcg": {"NDCG@10": 0.5, "NDCG@100": 0.5, "NDCG@1000": 0.5, "NDCG@10000": 0.5}, "map": {"MAP@10": 0.33333, "MAP@100": 0.33333, "MAP@1000": 0.33333, "MAP@10000": 0.33333}, "recall": {"Recall@10": 1.0, "Recall@100": 1.0, "Recall@1000": 1.0, "Recall@10000": 1.0}, "precision": {"P@10": 0.1, "P@100": 0.01, "P@1000": 0.001, "P@10000": 0.0001}, "delta": 0.32855999999999996, "instruction": "graph", "query": "voluntary muscle definition", "query_id": "538333", "dataset": "msmarco"}
