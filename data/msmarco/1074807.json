{"reasoning": "The user's query, 'what is a demand fee,' is primarily seeking an explanation of a specific term likely related to a financial context given the strengths of the legal case summary mentioned. The weakness lies in the presence of unrelated economic principles and rental fees which obscure the user\u2019s intent to understand a financial aspect of 'demand fee.' Therefore, it is essential to reframe the query contextually to focus on areas such as financial legislation, banking practices, and specific transactional fees that are accurately categorized as 'demand fees.'
