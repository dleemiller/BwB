{"reasoning": "The query is focused on the specific molecular mechanism of ITAM phosphorylation and its effect on T cell receptor (TCR) signal transfer from the ectodomain to the cytoplasmic tail. Given the strengths and weaknesses of the current results, there's a need to enhance the query to directly address the role of ITAM phosphorylation in this context while maintaining relevance to TCR signaling mechanisms.
