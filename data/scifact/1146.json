{"reasoning": "The original query implies a comparison of care quality between teaching and non-teaching hospitals, primarily focusing on mortality rates.  While the existing research provides a solid foundation, it lacks depth in exploring other crucial aspects of healthcare quality and suffers from the limitations of observational studies. \n\nTo enhance the search, we need to: 1) broaden the scope beyond mortality, encompassing patient experience and access to specialized services; 2) consider alternative study designs that can establish causality; 3) explore potential confounding factors influencing the observed differences.", "query_goals": ["Investigate patient experience in teaching vs non-teaching hospitals", "Identify access disparities to specialized care between hospital types", "Explore study designs beyond observational data to establish causal links", "Analyze potential confounding factors affecting quality comparisons"], "ineffective_terms": ["better", "provide"], "breadth_expansion": ["patient satisfaction", "healthcare access", "specialized services", "randomized controlled trials", "longitudinal studies", "confounding variables", "socioeconomic factors", "health outcomes"], "depth_chain": ["patient experience", "patient surveys", "hospital ratings", "communication with physicians", "wait times", "emotional support", "complications after discharge", "readmission rates"], "augmented_query": "patient experience patient surveys hospital ratings communication physicians wait times emotional support complications readmissions", "ndcg": {"NDCG@10": 1.0, "NDCG@100": 1.0, "NDCG@1000": 1.0, "NDCG@10000": 1.0}, "map": {"MAP@10": 1.0, "MAP@100": 1.0, "MAP@1000": 1.0, "MAP@10000": 1.0}, "recall": {"Recall@10": 1.0, "Recall@100": 1.0, "Recall@1000": 1.0, "Recall@10000": 1.0}, "precision": {"P@10": 0.1, "P@100": 0.01, "P@1000": 0.001, "P@10000": 0.0001}, "delta": 0.0, "instruction": "expand", "query": "Teaching hospitals do not provide better care than non-teaching hospitals.", "query_id": "1146", "dataset": "scifact", "generator_model": "ollama_chat/gemma2:9b-instruct-q8_0", "temperature": 1.0}
