{"reasoning": "The query seeks to understand the impact of rapamycin on triacylglycerols in fruit flies.  While it provides specific details about the compound (rapamycin) and the biological molecule (triacylglycerols), it lacks context regarding the experimental setup, dosage, or timeframe of the effect. To improve retrieval, we need to expand the query with terms related to:\n\n* **Fruit fly models:** Specific strains or genetic backgrounds commonly used in rapamycin studies.\n* **Experimental methods:** Techniques for measuring triacylglycerol levels (e.g., lipid extraction, spectrophotometry).\n* **Metabolic pathways:**  Processes involved in triacylglycerol synthesis and breakdown that might be influenced by rapamycin.", "query_goals": ["Identify the effects of rapamycin on triacylglycerol levels in fruit flies", "Explore experimental methods for measuring triacylglycerols in Drosophila", "Understand the molecular mechanisms linking rapamycin to lipid metabolism in fruit flies"], "node_classes": ["Drug", "Biological Molecule", "Model Organism", "Experimental Method", "Metabolic Pathway"], "query_nodes": ["rapamycin", "triacylglycerols", "fruit flies"], "nearest_neighbors": ["Drosophila melanogaster", "lipid metabolism", "TOR pathway", "AMPK", "insulin signaling"], "augmented_query": "\"rapamycin triacylglycerols Drosophila melanogaster lipid metabolism TOR pathway\"", "ndcg": {"NDCG@10": 1.0, "NDCG@100": 1.0, "NDCG@1000": 1.0, "NDCG@10000": 1.0}, "map": {"MAP@10": 1.0, "MAP@100": 1.0, "MAP@1000": 1.0, "MAP@10000": 1.0}, "recall": {"Recall@10": 1.0, "Recall@100": 1.0, "Recall@1000": 1.0, "Recall@10000": 1.0}, "precision": {"P@10": 0.1, "P@100": 0.01, "P@1000": 0.001, "P@10000": 0.0001}, "delta": 0.36907, "instruction": "graph", "query": "Rapamycin decreases the concentration of triacylglycerols in fruit flies.", "query_id": "1014", "dataset": "scifact", "generator_model": "ollama_chat/gemma2:9b-instruct-q8_0", "temperature": 1.0}
