{"reasoning": "The query focuses on understanding the role of Ly49Q in neutrophil migration through its regulation of membrane raft functions. While existing results provide a good foundation, they lack specific examples and deeper insights into the signaling pathways involved. To improve the search, we need to: 1) clarify the goals of the research, 2) identify terms that might be too broad, 3) explore related concepts beyond membrane rafts, 4) delve deeper into one specific aspect of membrane raft regulation, and finally, 5) construct an augmented query incorporating these refinements.", "query_goals": ["Understand Ly49Q's influence on neutrophil migration", "Identify specific mechanisms of membrane raft regulation by Ly49Q", "Explore signaling pathways involved in Ly49Q-mediated migration"], "ineffective_terms": ["organization", "inflammation"], "breadth_expansion": ["lipid rafts", "cell adhesion molecules", "cytoskeleton", "chemotaxis", "signal transduction"], "depth_chain": ["lipid rafts", "cholesterol", "sphingolipids", "lipid-protein interactions", "signaling cascades"], "augmented_query": "Ly49Q, neutrophil migration, membrane rafts, cholesterol, sphingolipids, signal transduction, chemotaxis", "ndcg": {"NDCG@10": 1.0, "NDCG@100": 1.0, "NDCG@1000": 1.0, "NDCG@10000": 1.0}, "map": {"MAP@10": 1.0, "MAP@100": 1.0, "MAP@1000": 1.0, "MAP@10000": 1.0}, "recall": {"Recall@10": 1.0, "Recall@100": 1.0, "Recall@1000": 1.0, "Recall@10000": 1.0}, "precision": {"P@10": 0.1, "P@100": 0.01, "P@1000": 0.001, "P@10000": 0.0001}, "delta": 0.0, "instruction": "expand", "query": "Ly49Q directs the organization of neutrophil migration to inflammation sites by regulating membrane raft functions.", "query_id": "723", "dataset": "scifact", "generator_model": "ollama_chat/gemma2:9b-instruct-q8_0", "temperature": 1.0}
