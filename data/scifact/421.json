{"reasoning": "The query delves into the specific interaction between molecular flexibility, steric hindrance, and the tumor microenvironment.  While existing results touch upon relevant areas like drug resistance and cellular behavior within tumors, they lack a direct focus on the impact of molecular rigidity/flexibility on steric effects in this context. \n\nTherefore, we need to map a conceptual territory that encompasses:\n\n1. **Central Point:** The concept of steric hindrance as it relates to flexible vs. rigid molecules in a tumor microenvironment.\n2. **Cardinal Directions:** Explore the interplay between molecular structure (flexibility), drug delivery and efficacy (therapeutic applications), cellular responses within the tumor microenvironment, and the physical properties of the tumor matrix.", "central_coordinates": ["Steric Hindrance", "Flexible vs. Rigid Molecules", "Tumor Microenvironment"], "boundary_areas": ["Drug Delivery Systems", "Cancer Cell Signaling", "Tumor Immunology", "Biomaterial Properties", "Pharmacokinetics"], "key_landmarks": ["Diffusion Barriers", "Cell Membrane Receptors", "Extracellular Matrix", "Angiogenesis", "Nanoparticle Drug Delivery"], "detail_features": ["Size Exclusion Effects", "Conformational Flexibility", "Molecular Docking", "Target Accessibility", "Enhanced Permeability and Retention (EPR) Effect"], "navigation_terms": ["Steric Hindrance", "Tumor Microenvironment", "Flexible Molecules", "Rigid Molecules", "Drug Delivery", "Cell Membrane", "Extracellular Matrix", "Nanoparticles"], "augmented_query": "\"impact of molecular flexibility on drug delivery and efficacy in the tumor microenvironment\", \"steric hindrance of flexible vs. rigid molecules by tumor extracellular matrix\"", "ndcg": {"NDCG@10": 0.0, "NDCG@100": 0.15818, "NDCG@1000": 0.15818, "NDCG@10000": 0.15818}, "map": {"MAP@10": 0.0, "MAP@100": 0.01266, "MAP@1000": 0.01266, "MAP@10000": 0.01266}, "recall": {"Recall@10": 0.0, "Recall@100": 1.0, "Recall@1000": 1.0, "Recall@10000": 1.0}, "precision": {"P@10": 0.0, "P@100": 0.01, "P@1000": 0.001, "P@10000": 0.0001}, "delta": 0.04079999999999999, "instruction": "cartography", "query": "Flexible molecules experience greater steric hindrance in the tumor microenviroment than rigid molecules.", "query_id": "421", "dataset": "scifact", "generator_model": "ollama_chat/gemma2:9b-instruct-q8_0", "temperature": 1.0}
