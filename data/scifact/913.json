{"reasoning": "The query focuses on the interaction between PPARs and RXRs, specifically regarding the inhibitory effects of PPAR ligands. While existing results provide a good foundation on PPAR function, they lack direct information on this specific inhibition mechanism. To address this gap, we need expertise from multiple disciplines: pharmacology to understand ligand interactions, molecular biology to delve into receptor mechanisms, and potentially endocrinology to explore hormonal influences.", "selected_experts": ["Pharmacologist", "Molecular Biologist", "Endocrinologist", "Biochemist", "Toxicologist"], "expert_insights": ["PPAR ligands can indeed inhibit PPAR-RXR heterodimers, but the mechanism is complex and depends on the specific ligand.

Ligand binding to PPAR can disrupt these interactions by altering the receptor conformation or interfering with dimerization domains.", "Hormonal pathways can influence PPAR-RXR activity.  For example, thyroid hormone receptors can compete with RXRs for heterodimerization with other nuclear receptors, potentially impacting PPAR function.", "Investigating potential enzyme-mediated metabolism of PPAR ligands is crucial.
