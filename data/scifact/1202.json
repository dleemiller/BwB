{"reasoning": "The query seeks to understand the specific mechanisms by which the center of an immune cell granuloma triggers a pro-inflammatory immune response.  While existing results touch on pro-inflammatory aspects within granulomas, they lack direct evidence linking the center's components to this induction.\n\nTo improve results, we need to expand the query to include:\n* **Cellular Components:** Specific cells or structures within the granuloma center (e.g., macrophages, T cells, cytokines)\n* **Molecular Mediators:** Signaling molecules or proteins involved in inflammation (e.g., TNF-alpha, IL-1beta)", "query_goals": ["identify cellular components in granuloma center", "determine molecular mediators of inflammation", "explain mechanism of pro-inflammatory induction"], "node_classes": ["Granuloma", "Immune Cell", "Cytokine", "Macrophage", "T cell", "Inflammation", "Protein", "Signal Transduction"], "query_nodes": ["Granuloma Center", "Immune Response", "Pro-inflammatory", "Inflammatory Mediators"], "nearest_neighbors": ["macrophages", "TNF-alpha", "IL-1beta", "T cell activation", "granuloma formation", "apoptosis"], "augmented_query": "\"Cellular components in granuloma center that induce pro-inflammatory immune response, cytokines involved in inflammation within granuloma, molecular mechanisms of granuloma-induced inflammation\"", "ndcg": {"NDCG@10": 1.0, "NDCG@100": 1.0, "NDCG@1000": 1.0, "NDCG@10000": 1.0}, "map": {"MAP@10": 1.0, "MAP@100": 1.0, "MAP@1000": 1.0, "MAP@10000": 1.0}, "recall": {"Recall@10": 1.0, "Recall@100": 1.0, "Recall@1000": 1.0, "Recall@10000": 1.0}, "precision": {"P@10": 0.1, "P@100": 0.01, "P@1000": 0.001, "P@10000": 0.0001}, "delta": 0.0, "instruction": "graph", "query": "The center of the granuloma in an immune cell induces a pro-inflammatory immune response.", "query_id": "1202", "dataset": "scifact", "generator_model": "ollama_chat/gemma2:9b-instruct-q8_0", "temperature": 1.0}
