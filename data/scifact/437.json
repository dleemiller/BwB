{"reasoning": "The query seeks to understand the functional consequences of genomic alterations in Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS).  While existing research provides a good overview of MDS pathogenesis, it lacks a direct focus on how specific genetic changes manifest as phenotypic effects.  \n\nTo address this, we'll construct a conceptual map that centers on the relationship between genomics and functional outcomes in MDS. We'll explore neighboring areas like epigenetic regulation, cellular signaling pathways, and disease progression to understand the broader context of these alterations.", "central_coordinates": ["Genomic Alterations", "Functional Consequences"], "boundary_areas": ["Epigenetic Regulation", "Cellular Signaling", "Hematopoiesis", "Disease Progression"], "key_landmarks": ["Mutations (e.g., SF3B1, TET2)", "Clonal Evolution", "Dysregulated Gene Expression", "Impaired Hematopoietic Stem Cell Function", "Leukemic Transformation"], "detail_features": ["Driver Mutations", "Passenger Mutations", "Oncogenic Signaling Pathways", "Apoptosis Resistance", "Bone Marrow Failure", "Cytopenias"], "navigation_terms": ["Genotype-Phenotype Correlation", "Functional Genomics", "Hematopoietic Differentiation", "Therapeutic Targets"], "augmented_query": "Investigate the functional consequences of specific genomic alterations in MDS, focusing on their impact on cellular signaling pathways, hematopoiesis, and disease progression.
