{"reasoning": "The query seeks to understand how cold exposure influences the recruitment of brown adipose tissue (BAT). While existing results provide valuable insights into molecular mechanisms related to UCP1 regulation, they lack direct evidence on how cold exposure *directly* affects BAT recruitment.  Therefore, expanding the query to encompass broader aspects of BAT activation and potential alternative pathways could yield more comprehensive results.", "query_goals": ["Understand the direct effects of cold exposure on BAT recruitment", "Identify factors influencing BAT activation beyond UCP1 regulation", "Explore diverse mechanisms involved in cold-induced thermogenesis"], "node_classes": ["Cold Exposure", "Brown Adipose Tissue (BAT)", "UCP1", "Thermogenesis", "Signaling Pathways", "Molecular Mechanisms"], "query_nodes": ["Cold Exposure", "BAT Recruitment", "UCP1"], "nearest_neighbors": ["Beige Adipose Tissue", "Mitochondrial Biogenesis", "Insulin Sensitivity", "Energy Expenditure", "Adipocyte Differentiation"], "augmented_query": "\"cold exposure BAT recruitment UCP1  thermogenesis signaling pathways insulin sensitivity energy expenditure\"", "ndcg": {"NDCG@10": 0.63093, "NDCG@100": 0.63093, "NDCG@1000": 0.63093, "NDCG@10000": 0.63093}, "map": {"MAP@10": 0.5, "MAP@100": 0.5, "MAP@1000": 0.5, "MAP@10000": 0.5}, "recall": {"Recall@10": 1.0, "Recall@100": 1.0, "Recall@1000": 1.0, "Recall@10000": 1.0}, "precision": {"P@10": 0.1, "P@100": 0.01, "P@1000": 0.001, "P@10000": 0.0001}, "delta": 0.0, "instruction": "graph", "query": "Cold exposure reduces BAT recruitment.", "query_id": "269", "dataset": "scifact", "generator_model": "ollama_chat/gemma2:9b-instruct-q8_0", "temperature": 1.0}
