{"reasoning": "The query is \"Movies with eight or more Academy Awards\". The goal is to retrieve movie titles that have won a significant number of Academy Awards, specifically eight or more. The current results are weak because they mention \"Academy Award\" but fail to list the movies themselves, indicating a need for greater precision and focus on actual winners.\n\nI will accomplish this by creating a conceptual graph that centers on \"Academy Awards\" and \"movies\". Then, I will traverse the graph to find related terms like \"Best Picture\", \"winning films lists\", \"award history\" and \"academy award wins by movie\".
