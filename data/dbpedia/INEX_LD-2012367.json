{"reasoning": "The query \"invented telescope\" can be approached from various user perspectives, ranging from someone with no prior knowledge to researchers delving into historical specifics. This requires identifying different personas, their search strategies, the progression of their understanding, and how they would express their intent in different contexts. The augmented queries aim to capture these nuances by including vocabulary related to the telescope's history, mechanics, different types, and the lives and contributions of its inventors and scientists.", "user_personas": ["Elementary School Student", "Amateur Astronomer", "History of Science Enthusiast", "Optical Engineer"], "search_vocabulary": ["who made the first telescope", "telescope history", "types of telescopes", "refracting telescope inventor", "reflecting telescope invention", "early telescope designs", "Galileo telescope", "Newton telescope", "Janssen telescope", "who invented the spyglass?", "What were early telescopes used for?", "How does a telescope work?", "advanced telescope design", "telescope lens grinding techniques", "telescope mirror manufacturing", "achromatic lens invention", "resolution limits of early telescopes", "telescope aberrations", "telescope patents"], "journey_stages": ["basic definition of a telescope", "early telescope inventors", "different types of telescopes", "principles of optics in telescopes", "evolution of telescope design", "key innovations in telescope technology", "historical context of early telescopes", "modern telescope technology", "future of telescope design", "telescope applications in astronomy"], "usage_scenarios": ["Writing a school report on telescopes", "Preparing for an amateur astronomy club presentation", "Researching the history of scientific instruments for a book", "Designing a new type of telescope lens", "Understanding the historical context of astronomy", "Building a telescope as a hobby", "Comparing different telescope designs for personal use", "Studying the limitations of early telescope technology", "Investigating early contributions to optics", "Documenting the socio-economic influences on the invention and distribution of the telescope"], "intent_terms": ["discover", "invention", "history", "early", "first", "who", "how", "mechanism", "design", "types", "purpose", "use", "improve", "evolution", "precursors", "development", "refraction", "reflection", "lens", "Galileo", "Newton", "Janssen", "Lipperhey", "spyglass"], "augmented_query": "invented telescope history early design types inventors Galileo Newton Janssen Lipperhey \"first telescope\" \"early telescope\" spyglass refraction reflection lens mechanism \"who invented\" \"how does it work\" \"telescope precursors\"", "ndcg": {"NDCG@10": 0.8572, "NDCG@100": 0.91694, "NDCG@1000": 0.93563, "NDCG@10000": 0.93563}, "map": {"MAP@10": 0.32947, "MAP@100": 0.75996, "MAP@1000": 0.76816, "MAP@10000": 0.76816}, "recall": {"Recall@10": 0.34783, "Recall@100": 0.95652, "Recall@1000": 1.0, "Recall@10000": 1.0}, "precision": {"P@10": 0.8, "P@100": 0.22, "P@1000": 0.023, "P@10000": 0.0023}, "delta": 0.02523999999999993, "instruction": "journey", "query": "invented telescope", "query_id": "INEX_LD-2012367", "dataset": "dbpedia", "generator_model": "openrouter/google/gemini-2.0-flash-001", "temperature": 1.0}
