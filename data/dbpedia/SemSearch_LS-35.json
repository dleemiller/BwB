{"reasoning": "The query \"republics of the former Yugoslavia\" requires identifying and listing the constituent republics of the former Yugoslavia. I'll start by centering on the core concept of Yugoslav republics, then expand to neighboring political entities and historical contexts. Key landmarks will be the specific republics and the events leading to their formation and dissolution. Detailed features include their constitutions, demographics, and roles within the federation. The navigation terms will aid in understanding the geopolitical landscape. Finally, the augmented query will explicitly request a list of republics and related political entities.", "central_coordinates": ["Former Yugoslavia", "Political structure", "Regional history", "Nationalities"], "boundary_areas": ["Balkans", "Post-Socialist states", "European history", "Cold War era", "Successor states", "International relations", "Ethnic conflicts in the Balkans"], "key_landmarks": ["Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRJ)", "Serbia", "Croatia", "Slovenia", "Bosnia and Herzegovina", "Montenegro", "Macedonia (North Macedonia)", "Dissolution of Yugoslavia", "Yugoslav Wars", "Constitution of 1974"], "detail_features": ["Autonomous provinces (Vojvodina, Kosovo)", "League of Communists of Yugoslavia", "Ethnic composition of each republic", "Economic disparities between republics", "Political leadership in each republic", "Referendums for independence", "Role of the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA)"], "navigation_terms": ["Republic", "Federation", "Autonomous Province", "Self-determination", "Nationalism", "Ethnic Cleansing", "War Crimes Tribunal", "Balkanization", "Succession", "International Recognition"], "augmented_query": "\"list of republics constituting former Yugoslavia Serbia Croatia Slovenia Bosnia and Herzegovina Montenegro North Macedonia autonomous provinces Vojvodina Kosovo\"", "ndcg": {"NDCG@10": 0.63994, "NDCG@100": 0.7746, "NDCG@1000": 0.83372, "NDCG@10000": 0.83372}, "map": {"MAP@10": 0.13249, "MAP@100": 0.53798, "MAP@1000": 0.5497, "MAP@10000": 0.5497}, "recall": {"Recall@10": 0.18182, "Recall@100": 0.84848, "Recall@1000": 1.0, "Recall@10000": 1.0}, "precision": {"P@10": 0.6, "P@100": 0.28, "P@1000": 0.033, "P@10000": 0.0033}, "delta": 0.09184000000000003, "instruction": "cartography", "query": "republics of the former Yugoslavia", "query_id": "SemSearch_LS-35", "dataset": "dbpedia", "generator_model": "openrouter/google/gemini-2.0-flash-001", "temperature": 1.0}
