{"reasoning": "The provided documents are biographical summaries of Pacific navigators and Australian explorers. To augment the search query, I will analyze the temporal evolution of Pacific navigation and Australian exploration. This will involve identifying key figures, methodologies, landmark voyages, evolving terminologies, and modern practices. The augmented query will include terms related to historical navigation, early explorations, colonial expansion, indigenous contributions, and modern maritime studies. The goal is to expand the search to include more comprehensive information about the history, impact, and future directions of Pacific navigation and Australian exploration.", "historical_foundation": ["Polynesian navigation", "Lapita culture", "outrigger canoes", "wayfinding", "Captain James Cook", "First Fleet", "Aboriginal Australians", "Dutch East India Company", "Willem Janszoon", "Terra Australis Incognita", "astrolabe", "sextant"], "development_milestones": ["European contact", "mapping of the Pacific", "establishment of colonies", "maritime charts", "chronometer", "exploration of the Australian coastline", "Bass and Flinders circumnavigation of Tasmania", "Macassan contact with northern Australia", "Ethnographic studies", "maritime museums"], "current_landscape": ["maritime archaeology", "Indigenous maritime heritage", "environmental impact assessments", "sustainable tourism", "maritime law", "oceanography", "climate change impact", "sonar technology", "remote sensing"], "emerging_trends": ["autonomous navigation systems", "climate change impacts on coastal communities", "underwater cultural heritage management", "ocean conservation efforts", "digital mapping technologies", "AI-assisted navigation", "Renewable energy powered vessels", "sustainable shipping"], "temporal_terms": ["ancient voyaging", "age of exploration", "colonial era", "modern maritime", "future seas", "pre-colonial", "post-colonial", "early contact", "contemporary navigation", "emerging maritime technologies"], "augmented_query": "Pacific navigation history, Australian exploration timeline, Indigenous maritime knowledge, Polynesian wayfinding, Captain Cook voyages, First Fleet journals, maritime archaeology Australia, sustainable ocean practices, climate change sea level Australia, Terra Australis, Dutch East India Company exploration, autonomous vessel Pacific", "ndcg": {"NDCG@10": 0.60514, "NDCG@100": 0.73747, "NDCG@1000": 0.81329, "NDCG@10000": 0.81329}, "map": {"MAP@10": 0.13685, "MAP@100": 0.41999, "MAP@1000": 0.45201, "MAP@10000": 0.45201}, "recall": {"Recall@10": 0.16667, "Recall@100": 0.83333, "Recall@1000": 1.0, "Recall@10000": 1.0}, "precision": {"P@10": 0.5, "P@100": 0.25, "P@1000": 0.03, "P@10000": 0.003}, "delta": 0.008199999999999985, "instruction": "timetravel", "query": "Pacific navigators Australia explorers", "query_id": "INEX_XER-65", "dataset": "dbpedia", "generator_model": "openrouter/google/gemini-2.0-flash-001", "temperature": 1.0}
