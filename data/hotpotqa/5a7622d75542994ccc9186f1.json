{"reasoning": "The query asks for a comparison of birthdates. The strengths and weaknesses show that the search results have correctly identified Leni Riefenstahl and provided her birth date. The results also mention Garry Marshall, but do not include his birthdate. To directly answer the question, I need to find Garry Marshall's birthdate. Furthermore, the results include other people with the same name. Therefore, the query needs to be narrowed down to the correct Garry Marshall.\n\nTo augment the search, I can add the profession (director) and possibly the name of well-known works that he directed. From there, I want to compare the birthdates of the two entities. I can achieve this by creating headlines that show their comparison as well as extracting terms that would narrow my search to the particular subject.", "query_goals": ["Find Garry Marshall's birthdate.", "Verify that the Garry Marshall is the correct one (director).", "Compare the birthdates of Garry Marshall and Leni Riefenstahl.", "Determine who was born earlier."], "important_events": ["Leni Riefenstahl's birth", "Garry Marshall's birth", "Release of Triumph of the Will (Riefenstahl)", "Release of Pretty Woman (Marshall)", "Significant biographical events in the lives of both individuals"], "questions": ["What is Garry Marshall's full birthdate (day, month, year)?", "What were Garry Marshall's most famous works?", "What were Leni Riefenstahl's most famous works?", "What were the major influences on Garry Marshall and Leni Riefenstahl's careers?", "How did the historical contexts influence Marshall's comedies and Riefenstahl's documentaries?"], "headlines": ["Garry Marshall vs. Leni Riefenstahl: A Birthdate Showdown", "Hollywood vs. Nazi Germany: Comparing the Lives of Garry Marshall and Leni Riefenstahl", "Who Came First?
