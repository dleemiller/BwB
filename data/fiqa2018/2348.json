{"reasoning": "The query asks about a simple profit-sharing investment agreement. To gain more insight, I will use metaphors from different domains to explore the underlying concepts of risk, reward, effort, and incentives. I'll look at investing as a garden, a collaborative art project, a sports team, a business partnership, and a game of chance. These metaphors should illuminate the potential challenges with the original proposed arrangement from various angles.", "generated_metaphors": ["Investing is like cultivating a garden.", "Investing is like a collaborative art project.", "Investing is like being on a sports team.", "Investing is like running a business partnership.", "Investing is like gambling at a casino."], "domain_mappings": ["Gardening: Seeds (Capital), Gardener (Investor), Soil (Market), Harvest (Profit), Weeds/Pests (Risks) -> Investing: Initial investment, Fund manager/Individual investor, Market conditions, Investment returns, Market volatility/Economic downturn", "Collaborative Art: Canvas (Investment opportunity), Artists (Investor & Capital Provider), Paint/Brushes (Skills/Resources), Masterpiece (Successful investment), Creative differences (Disagreements on strategy) -> Investing: Underlying asset/business, Investor's Expertise, Trading tools/Market data, Profitable Investment, Conflicting investment styles", "Sports Team: Players (investor/capital provider), Coach (financial advisor), Training (due diligence), Game (market), Score (profit) -> Investing: Skills/Capital, Investment strategy, Research, Market conditions, Returns/Losses", "Business Partnership: Partners (Investor & Capital Provider), Business Plan (Investment Strategy), Resources (Capital/Expertise), Revenue (Profit), Expenses (Losses) -> Investing: Shared responsibilities, Documented strategy, Shared Costs/Rewards, Investment gains, Investment losses", "Gambling: Chips (Capital), Gambler (Investor), Table (Market), Winnings (Profit), Losses (Losses) -> Investing: Initial Investment, Individual, Market conditions, Investment returns, Investment losses"], "metaphorical_language": ["Gardening: Seeds, cultivate, harvest, weeds, fertilizer, pruning, soil, irrigation", "Art: Canvas, palette, brush, strokes, masterpiece, gallery, composition, perspective", "Sports: Team, players, coach, training, game, score, strategy, playoffs", "Business: Partnership, revenue, expenses, profit, loss, strategy, market share, competition", "Gambling: Chips, bet, odds, winnings, losses, risk, jackpot, probability"], "extended_metaphors": ["Gardening: Some seeds are more likely to sprout.
