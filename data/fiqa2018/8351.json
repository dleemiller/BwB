{"reasoning": "To effectively expand the query \"What happens when a calendar spread is assigned in a non-margin account?\" into an enriched conceptual territory, we must identify critical components of options trading as they relate to non-margin accounts. The strengths highlight comprehensive insights into option assignments and strategic advice for managing obligations post-assignment, such as the T+3 settlement process. However, there are weaknesses like redundant information about margin accounts and lack of real-world examples specific to non-margin scenarios. By establishing a conceptual map centered on non-margin account practices in options trading, particularly calendar spreads, we can better navigate this topic by focusing on its core mechanisms, surrounding financial regulations, strategic implications, risk management techniques, and broker-specific policies.", "central_coordinates": ["Option assignment in non-margin accounts", "Calendar spread mechanics", "T+3 settlement process"], "boundary_areas": ["Options trading terminology", "Non-margin account characteristics", "Risk management strategies", "Brokerage practices", "Regulatory frameworks"], "key_landmarks": ["Assignment process of options", "Cash settlement procedures", "Expiry and close-out strategies", "Financial regulatory bodies (e.g., FINRA, SEC)", "Broker account policies on calendar spreads"], "detail_features": ["Intraday vs. end-of-day settlement differences", "Impact on investor capital management", "Role of broker communication in assignments", "Strategies for mitigating assignment risks", "Case studies or examples illustrating typical non-margin scenarios"], "navigation_terms": ["Non-margin account", "Calendar spread", "Option assignment", "T+3 process", "Cash settlement", "Risk management", "Broker policies", "Regulatory compliance"], "augmented_query": "What is the procedure for option assignment in a non-margin account, specifically when dealing with calendar spreads?
