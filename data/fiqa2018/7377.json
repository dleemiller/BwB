{"reasoning": "The query pertains to the specific type of returns Vanguard quotes, which could involve understanding their methodology in financial reporting. Given the current results focus on qualitative insights and broad performance metrics without directly addressing return types like arithmetic or geometric means, we need to augment the query with relevant historical, developmental, and terminological context related to these concepts. By exploring how the concept of 'returns' has evolved and is discussed in financial literature over time, we can enhance the precision and relevance of the search.", "historical_foundation": ["Introduction of arithmetic vs. geometric mean as foundational methods for calculating investment returns in early finance literature", "Geometric mean acknowledged by mathematicians like Leonard Euler as significant for compounded growth rates", "Inception of modern portfolio theory emphasizing different return measures"], "development_milestones": ["Adoption of geometric mean in the evaluation of long-term fund performance during mid-20th century", "Development and increased use of Sharpe Ratio, which depends on understanding different types of returns, post-Warren Buffett\u2019s investment philosophies", "Introduction of Total Return Indexes that calculate using reinvestment at period end rates"], "current_landscape": ["Common industry preference for using geometric means in evaluating mutual funds and ETFs to represent realistic compounded growth", "Standardization in financial reporting practices emphasizing transparency in how returns are quoted by firms like Vanguard", "Regulatory bodies encouraging clear differentiation between types of return measures used"], "emerging_trends": ["Growing interest in sustainable investment performance metrics, incorporating Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors into return calculations", "Rise of personalized investment platforms using AI to offer bespoke portfolio performance insights based on client-specific goals", "Incorporation of machine learning algorithms to predict future fund returns with a more nuanced understanding of historical data"], "temporal_terms": ["Arithmetic mean", "Geometric mean", "Compounded annual growth rate (CAGR)", "Sharpe Ratio", "Total Return Index", "ESG metrics", "Machine learning analytics"], "augmented_query": "What specific type of returns (arithmetic vs. geometric) does Vanguard quote in their financial reporting and performance metrics, considering historical methods and modern regulatory standards?", "ndcg": {"NDCG@10": 1.0, "NDCG@100": 1.0, "NDCG@1000": 1.0, "NDCG@10000": 1.0}, "map": {"MAP@10": 1.0, "MAP@100": 1.0, "MAP@1000": 1.0, "MAP@10000": 1.0}, "recall": {"Recall@10": 1.0, "Recall@100": 1.0, "Recall@1000": 1.0, "Recall@10000": 1.0}, "precision": {"P@10": 0.1, "P@100": 0.01, "P@1000": 0.001, "P@10000": 0.0001}, "delta": 0.56932, "instruction": "timetravel", "query": "What type of returns Vanguard is quoting?", "query_id": "7377", "dataset": "fiqa2018", "generator_model": "ollama_chat/phi4:14b-q8_0", "temperature": 1.0}
