{"reasoning": "The query aims to find the average cost of a portfolio on a trading site. The existing results discuss cost factors in trading and investing but don't directly answer the question. To address this, I will create a conceptual map focusing on the components that contribute to the cost of a portfolio, the different types of fees involved, and related concepts like portfolio size and trading frequency. This will allow me to identify key navigation terms and expand the query to retrieve more relevant information.", "central_coordinates": ["Portfolio Cost", "Direct Costs/Indirect Costs", "Trading Fees/Management Fees", "Small Portfolio/Large Portfolio"], "boundary_areas": ["Trading Psychology", "Tax Implications", "Financial Planning", "Risk Management", "Investment Strategies"], "key_landmarks": ["Commission Fees", "Management Fees", "Transaction Costs", "Expense Ratios", "Advisory Fees", "Platform Fees", "Minimum Balance Requirements", "Bid-Ask Spread"], "detail_features": ["Commission-free trading platforms", "Tiered fee structures", "AUM-based fees", "Performance-based fees", "Inactivity fees", "Fund expense ratios (e.g., ETFs, mutual funds)", "Spread costs for different asset classes, such as equities, options, or cryptocurrencies", "Cost of research and data subscriptions"], "navigation_terms": ["Commission", "Management Fee", "Expense Ratio", "AUM", "Trading Platform", "Minimum Investment", "Bid-Ask Spread", "Transaction Cost", "Advisory Fee", "Platform Fee"], "augmented_query": "\"Portfolio cost breakdown trading platform fees\"", "ndcg": {"NDCG@10": 0.0, "NDCG@100": 0.19196, "NDCG@1000": 0.19196, "NDCG@10000": 0.19196}, "map": {"MAP@10": 0.0, "MAP@100": 0.02778, "MAP@1000": 0.02778, "MAP@10000": 0.02778}, "recall": {"Recall@10": 0.0, "Recall@100": 1.0, "Recall@1000": 1.0, "Recall@10000": 1.0}, "precision": {"P@10": 0.0, "P@100": 0.01, "P@1000": 0.001, "P@10000": 0.0001}, "delta": 0.04718, "instruction": "cartography", "query": "What is the average cost of a portfolio on a trading site?", "query_id": "8034", "dataset": "fiqa2018", "generator_model": "openrouter/google/gemini-2.0-flash-001", "temperature": 1.0}
