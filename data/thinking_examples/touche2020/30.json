I now give the (online)stage to my opponent, and wish him/her good luck.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: To start out carrying a concealed handgun in public is permitted in all 50 states as of 2013, when Illinois became the last state to enact concealed carry legislation. Some states require gun owners to obtain permits while others have \"unrestricted carry\" and do not require permits. Proponents of concealed carry say that criminals are less likely to attack someone they believe to be armed. They cite the 2nd Amendment's \"right of the people to keep and bear arms,\" and argue that most adults who legally carry a concealed gun are law-abiding and do not misuse their firearms. Opponents of concealed carry argue that increased gun ownership leads to more gun crime and unintended gun injuries. They contend that concealed handguns increase the chances of arguments becoming lethal, and that society would be safer with fewer guns on the street, not more. The only state/district in the USA that prohibits carrying and concealing firearms (Washington DC) has more than double the highest violent crime rate in the US. This does not include American Samoa and the north Mariana islands. SOURCES:/ http://www.usacarry.com... https://www.census.gov...\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: Carrying concealed handguns are used more for criminal homicides than homicides. According to the violence policy center, For every justifiable homicide (a death caused by someone defending themselves) there were 34 innocent people killed by criminals who obtained a handgun and permit. and in 2014 eighteen states reported no justifiable homicides caused by handguns. People rarely use handguns for protection. And handguns may make someone feel safer but in reality they actually make them less safe. According to a peer reviews study someone carrying a gun for self defense was 4.5 times more likely to be shot during an assault then an assault victim without a gun.\n",
  "thought_process": "As I delve into the query \"Should adults have the right to carry a concealed handgun?\", my initial impressions are shaped by the complexities of the debate. It's a topic that evokes strong emotional responses, with arguments often rooted in personal beliefs rather than empirical evidence. The question itself seems to hover between the realms of personal freedom and public safety, making it a challenging issue to navigate.\n\nLooking at the existing reasoning provided, I appreciate the approach of utilizing metaphorical thinking to explore different perspectives on concealed carry. This method allows for a deeper understanding of the arguments by comparing the right to carry a concealed handgun to concepts from diverse domains. The metaphors generated\u2014such as concealed carry being a shield, a loaded dice game, a public trust, a societal pressure gauge, and an emotional amplifier\u2014offer insightful ways to frame the discussion. Each metaphor highlights different aspects of the debate, from personal protection and societal risk to the emotional and psychological impacts of gun ownership.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the text snippets provided touch on various aspects of the concealed carry debate. The information ranges from the legal status of concealed carry in different states to arguments from both proponents and opponents regarding safety, crime rates, and the Second Amendment. These snippets underscore the multifaceted nature of the issue, with different sources presenting contrasting views on the effectiveness and implications of concealed carry laws.\n\nTransitioning to a structured approach, I will apply the technique of query expansion via metaphorical thinking. This involves generating powerful metaphors for the query topic and mining them for conceptually related terminology from diverse domains. By doing so, we can uncover new insights and terms that might not be immediately apparent from the original query or initial results.\n\nApplying the steps of the query expansion technique, I first revisit the metaphors generated. Each offers a unique lens through which to view the issue of concealed carry:\n- The \"shield\" metaphor emphasizes protection and self-reliance.\n- The \"loaded dice game\" highlights risk and unpredictability.\n- The \"public trust\" frames gun ownership as a privilege with inherent responsibilities.\n- The \"societal pressure gauge\" suggests that concealed carry reflects underlying societal anxieties.\n- The \"emotional amplifier\" explores how firearms can intensify emotional states and influence decision-making.\n\nThrough the domain mapping process, I identify key terms and concepts from each metaphorical domain that can be applied to the topic of concealed carry. For instance, the \"shield\" metaphor leads to terms related to law enforcement, personal safety, and security systems, emphasizing concepts of protection and prevention. The \"dice game\" metaphor introduces terms from gambling, probability, and accidents, underscoring the elements of risk and unintended consequences.\n\nAs I explore the metaphors and their related domains, I notice the emergence of insightful cross-domain terms such as \"risk mitigation,\" \"collective responsibility,\" \"emotional intelligence,\" \"social contract,\" and \"preventive measures.\" These terms capture the essence of the debate, balancing individual rights with collective well-being and public safety concerns.\n\nThe process of metaphorical extension and combining metaphors to create hybrid perspectives further enriches our understanding. For example, considering concealed carry as both a \"shield\" and a \"loaded dice game\" highlights the tension between personal protection and societal risk, suggesting that policies must carefully balance these competing interests.\n\nThrough this structured yet intuitively guided process, the final expanded query emerges: \"impact concealed carry public safety societal anxieties individual rights vs collective well emotional factors gun ownership use.\" This query incorporates the core concerns and nuances of the original question, informed by the metaphors, domain mappings, and cross-domain terms extracted through the query expansion technique.\n\nIn synthesizing the insights gained, it becomes clear that the debate over concealed carry is multifaceted, involving legal, emotional, psychological, and societal dimensions. The expanded query reflects this complexity, aiming to capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of the issue. By applying metaphorical thinking and systematically exploring the generated metaphors, we can deepen our understanding of the concealed carry debate and potentially uncover more effective and nuanced approaches to addressing the underlying concerns.\n\nThe final terms for the expanded query have been selected based on their ability to illuminate the various facets of the issue, from public safety and individual rights to emotional factors and societal implications. These terms are intended to facilitate a more comprehensive exploration of the topic, acknowledging the intricacies of the debate and the need for a balanced approach that considers both individual and collective well-being.",
