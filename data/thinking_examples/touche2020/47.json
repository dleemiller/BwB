    "Homework can be like weight training, building mental stamina and resilience through repetition. However, excessive weight or improper form can lead to strain, burnout, and injury. The right amount of homework, like a carefully calibrated weightlifting program, leads to optimal cognitive development.",
    "Like a pressure cooker, homework can intensify learning and accelerate progress. But too much pressure, with unrealistic deadlines and excessive workload, can cause a blow-up, leading to stress, anxiety, and a negative association with learning.",
    "Homework can be envisioned as a garden, where students nurture their understanding through consistent effort. Good homework is like tending to the garden \u2013 watering, weeding, and providing the right nutrients. Neglect or over-cultivation can both be detrimental.",
    "Homework acts as a bridge connecting classroom learning to real-world application and independent thinking or further learning. A well-designed bridge allows for easy passage and strengthened connection, whereas a poorly constructed one can be a barrier or lead to unsafe transfer of knowledge. Homework could also connect the school and the home.",
    "Homework can be seen as an apprenticeship with the teacher as the master imparting skills. Students practice these skills under the guidance of the teacher and with feedback until they achieve mastery. Too much homework without adequate support and apprenticeship can lead to frustration and superficial gains."

  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: Although homework can be copied , that is only due to the fact that the homework we receive is too long. Homework is beneficial to understanding a subject and furthering your knowledge on the selected subject. Therefore Homework is beneficial to knowledge as long as it is a reasonable length to prevent anxiety.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n... While these cannot be measured on standardized tests, perseverance has garnered a lot of attention as an essential skill for successful students. Regular accomplishments like finishing homework build self-esteem, which aids students\" mental and physical health. Responsibility and time management are highly desirable qualities that benefit students long after they graduate.\" My source clearly demonstrates my point. Whilst the general public may not know these benefits, they are there, improving the child's work across the board. So, as you can clearly see from these arguments, and the sources I have provided, homework should not be abolished because it is beneficial to the children who do them. Sources: ~http://dictionary.cambridge.org... ~http://dictionary.cambridge.org... ~http://education.cu-portland.edu... ~https://www.washingtonpost.com...\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: I don't think homework is really beneficial to the school students. Teachers in the school have already given assignments or lessons to the students. The most crucial thing is that the students learn or gain something fruitful from the schools.Some research indicates no direct relationship between learning and homework, whereas other studies state that homework can cause stress in young students and that students from lower-income homes may not have access to the same amount of parental assistance and resources as students from higher-income homes. We just have to ensure the students score with flying colors in their exams and understanding towards all the subjects. As you can seen in above statement, homework causes stress to students. Especially in Asia region, parents like to sign up extra-classes after school for students to brush up their studies. They have to do the homework which is assigned by the teachers from school and extra-classes. If we remain in this state-quo, students will just get too stresses out and give up their studies. Is this the outcome you speculate?\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"Is homework beneficial?\"... this makes me think of the broader implications of assigning schoolwork outside of the classroom. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the impact on students' learning and well-being, I'm not sure yet what specific aspects they're most concerned about. \n\nAnalyzing the initial results, I notice that some texts suggest homework is beneficial for understanding a subject and building essential skills like perseverance and time management, while others argue it can cause stress and may not be equally accessible to all students. These perspectives highlight the complexity of the issue and the need for a more nuanced exploration.\n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here... Let me approach this using the query expansion via metaphorical thinking technique, which involves generating powerful metaphors for the query topic and mining them for conceptually related terminology from diverse domains. This should help because it allows us to explore the topic from different angles and capture both explicit and implicit aspects of the query.\n\nStarting with metaphor generation, I've developed five metaphors: Homework as Weight Training, Homework as a Pressure Cooker, Homework as a Garden, Homework as a Bridge, and Homework as an Apprenticeship. Each metaphor offers unique insights into the role and effects of homework. For instance, the weight training metaphor suggests that homework can build mental stamina and resilience but also warns against excessive strain. The pressure cooker metaphor highlights the potential for homework to intensify learning but also notes the risk of overwhelming students.\n\nThrough domain mapping, I've identified how elements from these metaphors correspond to aspects of homework. For example, the garden metaphor maps nurturing and growth in a garden to the process of learning and development through homework. This mapping reveals the importance of consistent effort and the right environment for effective learning.\n\nExploring the metaphorical language, terms like repetition, resistance, growth, and endurance from the weight training metaphor, and pressure, intensity, and release from the pressure cooker metaphor, provide valuable insights into the dynamics of homework. These terms can help us understand how homework affects students' mental and emotional states.\n\nExtending these metaphors further, I consider how each might reveal hidden aspects of the topic. For instance, the apprenticeship metaphor suggests that homework should be a guided learning process, with the teacher acting as a mentor. This extension underscores the importance of feedback and support in homework assignments.\n\nCompiling cross-domain terms from these metaphors, I've identified concepts like resistance, pressure, cultivation, connection, practical application, stamina, burnout, nurturing, guidance, workload, mental stamina, cognitive development, and barriers. These terms offer fresh perspectives on the benefits and drawbacks of homework, highlighting the need for a balanced approach that considers both the academic benefits and the potential for stress and burnout.\n\nApplying the metaphorical thinking technique has led to a deeper understanding of the query and its complexities. The technique has systematically guided my exploration, ensuring that I consider multiple facets of the issue. At the same time, my natural thought process has allowed for intuitive connections and reconsiderations, enriching the analysis with both structured and organic insights.\n\nThrough this process of applying metaphorical thinking and exploring related threads, I believe the terms \"benefits of homework,\" \"drawbacks of homework,\" \"optimal homework load,\" \"homework effectiveness,\" \"homework and stress,\" \"alternatives to homework,\" and \"linking activities to homework\" would be most effective for further inquiry. These terms capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, balancing the academic and well-being perspectives on homework.",
