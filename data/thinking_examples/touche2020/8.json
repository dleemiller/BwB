  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n... Nobody should be able to force a woman to carry the unwanted fetus and go through painful, sometimes dangerous, delivery. There are many reasons women need an abortion and it should only be used as a last resort, but sometimes it must be done. Women's rights Abortion is, in the majority of cases, morally wrong in my opinion seeing as birth control is so readily available and putting a child up for adoption is an option. I want to make it very clear I am totally against late term abortion! But the woman should be able to choose in the early stages of pregnancy if the woman sees no other option. Consciousness in the fetus Abortion should only be legal within the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, or the first trimester. 88% of abortions take place within this time frame. (I would prefer not to debate over the other 12% as I agree that it should be illegal) The first stages of consciousness begin to develop around 12-16 weeks with the development of thalamic afferents to the cortex but at this stage almost nothing from the thalamus can reach the cortex. The brain cannot sense pain until about 29 weeks but it can receive visual and auditory information at about 24 weeks. Suffering to the fetus cannot be a factor in early abortions because the fetus cannot feel pain. http://www.prochoiceamerica.org... http://www.nature.com... http://abortion.procon.org...\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: This will be a debate on when abortion should and should not be legal. My opponent can be for or against abortion, as my position could allow for contentions from both sides. *edit* My opponent must support another model for the legality of abortion.Resolution: Abortion should be legal until the fetus has brain activity (approximately 8 weeks gestation). Abortion would then be illegal after this point.There will be 4 rounds, 8000 character limit. First round acceptance only. I hope for a great debate!\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n... When they age out of the system, they're more likely than their peers to end up in jail, homeless or pregnant. They're also less likely to have a job or go to college.\" [14] In other cases, they're retained by their families. In these cases, the children face significant problems. (1) They're more likely than other kids to die at an early age. According to one 2016 study in the US, \"[S]tates with restrictive abortion policies increase IMR for black women by 2.214 infant deaths per 1,000 live births.\" [15] Another study in Finland found that children born due to denied abortions had an infant mortality rate of 24 infant deaths per 1,000 live births. [16] (2) They face economic and psychological disadvantages even in the long term. ...\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query 'Should abortion be legal?'... this makes me think of the complexities and nuances involved in such a sensitive topic. Though the user might actually be trying to understand different perspectives or seek validation for their own beliefs, it's clear that the query touches on deeply personal, moral, and legal dimensions. The initial results provided show a range of opinions, from advocating for women's rights and the legality of abortion under certain conditions to debates about the morality and timing of abortion. \n\nAnalyzing these results, I notice that they primarily present arguments without delving into personal experiences or nuanced perspectives, which is a crucial aspect of understanding the query's intent and evolving it into a more comprehensive exploration of the topic. The task now is to expand this query by analyzing how it would evolve in a community Q&A platform, considering both question variations and answer patterns.\n\nTo approach this systematically, I will use the Query Expansion via Community Q&A Patterns technique. This involves several steps: question reframing, identifying hidden motivations, analyzing answer archetypes, mapping community interactions, and vocabulary extraction. By applying this structured approach, I aim to uncover how people naturally discuss and explore the topic of abortion in a conversational setting, rather than just relying on formal documents or debates.\n\nStarting with question reframing, I consider how the original query could be rephrased to solicit more personal and experiential responses. For example, \"What are your personal thoughts on abortion?\" or \"How do you feel about the legality of abortion?\" could lead to more nuanced discussions. Identifying hidden motivations behind the query, such as seeking validation, personal guidance, or diverse perspectives, helps in understanding what the asker is really looking for.\n\nThe next step involves analyzing answer archetypes that could provide valuable responses, such as first-person narratives, expert opinions, practical advice, or contrarian viewpoints. This helps in targeting the types of responses that would be most insightful and helpful for someone exploring the topic of abortion. \n\nFurther, by mapping typical community dynamics, such as common follow-up questions, frequently debated aspects, and clarifications people often request, I can better understand how discussions evolve and what specific information or support individuals are seeking. This includes recognizing related questions that people also ask, which can provide a broader context and more comprehensive understanding of the topic.\n\nFinally, extracting terminology from emotional and subjective language, personal context descriptions, and community-specific jargon will help in crafting an expanded query that reflects how real people discuss this topic in conversational Q&A contexts. \n\nThrough this process, the expanded query begins to take shape, incorporating elements such as personal stories, emotional impacts, advice for facing unplanned pregnancies, and diverse perspectives on abortion rights. This approach not only systematically applies the Query Expansion via Community Q&A Patterns technique but also allows for natural thought patterns, including reconsiderations and intuitive connections, to emerge and enrich the expansion process.\n\nApplying the technique step by step, and interspersing it with organic thinking and natural cognitive elements, leads to a more authentic and effective query expansion. The technique helps in uncovering hidden aspects of the query and directs the expansion towards more personal, supportive, and informative content, which is crucial for someone navigating complex and sensitive topics like abortion.\n\nThe insights emerging from both the structured technique and intuitive thought patterns suggest that the expanded query should focus on capturing the personal, emotional, and diverse aspects of discussing abortion. This involves including terms that reflect personal experiences, emotional impacts, and the need for supportive and non-judgmental advice. \n\nSynthesizing the information and insights gained, I believe the most effective terms for expanding the query would include \"abortion personal stories,\" \"emotional impact of abortion laws,\" \"advice for facing an unplanned pregnancy,\" and \"diverse perspectives on abortion rights.\" These terms capture the essence of how individuals discuss and explore the topic of abortion in a community Q&A setting, seeking not just information, but also personal connections, emotional support, and a variety of viewpoints.\n\nThrough this process of applying the Query Expansion via Community Q&A Patterns technique and exploring related threads, I have developed a thought process that balances structured approach with natural cognitive patterns, demonstrating how an expert would really think when expanding a search query on a complex and sensitive topic like abortion.",
