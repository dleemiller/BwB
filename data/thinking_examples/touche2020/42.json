  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: Fighting in hockey, and in sports in general, should not be permissible for any reason. While fighting does have a historic place in the way hockey is played and is often a notable reason why people watch hockey in the first place, it should not be allowed moving forward. Player safety should be at the forefront of sports, and by allowing fighting in hockey, the sport is openly showing its disregard for such safety. Hockey leagues do not need players to police each other and hold each other accountable, that's what referees and league punishments are for. Basketball is a relatively physical sport as well, however the NBA generally does a good job of enforcing appropriate fines and penalties to discourage excessive violence on the court. These monetary fines, game suspensions, and other punishments all hold players accountable without relying on the players to do it themselves. Hockey is one of the very few sports where it is seen as acceptable to have designated players that serve no role other than to protect the team's talented star players from getting hurt in a fight - a sign that the sport needs to change its standards to reduce violence among its players. Cheap shots will always occur in sports, however it is better to address those dirty plays with real-life punishments that affect the player's ability to participate and make financial gains, rather than by putting them in a glass box for a few minutes.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: Fighting in hockey has always existed as a defining feature of the sport, and it has been accommodated in the rules for the NHL since the league's establishment in 1917. The practice of fighting in NHL games should be protected because it is not simply an exercise of unchecked aggression, but rather a tool to be used to hold players accountable for their actions. With 12 players on the rink at once and only 3 officials to regulate them, players often get away illegal/dangerous checks. In the absence of consistent regulation, fighting in hockey allows for the players to police one another. The knowledge that a dirty play or a cheap shot will likely result in retaliation offers an effective deterrent against players engaging in these potentially harmful activities. While fighting admittedly introduces a risk for injury, the severity of this injury pales in comparison to the potential injuries one might sustain from an illegal check.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: Hockey is a better sport then soccer for many reasons. First off, hockey is a faster sport. The average hockey player can skate up to 26.79 mph with some players speed even clocking in over 30 mph. According to physicist Thomas Humphrey, \"skating is the fastest way to travel on the surface of the earth on your feet.\" When you run, your front foot slows you down every time it hits the ground. In skating, one skate pushes down and the other skate glides. There is very little friction to slow you down. A soccer players average speed is only about 20 mph. You also can add the speed in which the puck travels around the ice. Pucks can travel up to 105 mph, with the fastest shot being recorded at 118.3 mph by Bobby Hull.(slap shot). A soccer ball has a maximum speed of only 80-85 mph. Anything over 85 mph is extremely rare. http://forums.bigsoccer.com... http://www.exploratorium.edu... Toughness is another reason why hockey is a better sport than soccer. In hockey there is plenty of contact, wether it is getting hit into the boards or fighting every game has contact. If you were to hit someone in a soccer game the referees would be handing out the colorful cards and someone will be on the ground looking to win an Oscar award. Here is a video to show you what i mean. ( you don't have to watch the full 7 minutes to get the point)\n",
  "thought_process": "As I delve into the query \"Should fighting be allowed in hockey?\", my initial thoughts are centered around the dichotomy of perspectives on this issue. On one hand, fighting has been an integral part of hockey's history and culture, often seen as a means for players to police themselves and maintain a level of respect on the ice. On the other hand, concerns about player safety, particularly in light of increasing awareness about the long-term effects of concussions and other injuries, bring forth strong arguments against allowing fighting in the sport.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that there are well-articulated arguments both for and against fighting in hockey. For instance, the first text snippet presents a compelling case against fighting, emphasizing the importance of player safety and the potential for other forms of discipline, such as monetary fines and game suspensions, to deter unwanted behavior. Conversely, the second snippet argues in favor of fighting, suggesting it serves as a necessary deterrent against dirty plays and cheap shots when official regulation may fall short.\n\nHowever, as I transition into a more structured approach using the \"Query Expansion Through Journalistic Investigation\" technique, I find myself considering a broader spectrum of viewpoints and contexts. This involves identifying diverse real-world scenarios where the query about fighting in hockey is relevant, such as professional leagues, amateur games, and historical contexts. It also entails recognizing the importance of authoritative sources, including experts in sports medicine, hockey historians, and current players and coaches, to provide a well-rounded understanding of the issue.\n\nApplying the steps of the journalistic investigation technique systematically, I begin to analyze the query from multiple angles. I consider the historical context of fighting in hockey, how it has evolved over time, and the role it plays in different leagues and levels of play. I also delve into the potential consequences of allowing or banning fighting, including the impact on player health, the sport's reputation, and fan engagement.\n\nAs I dig deeper, natural cognitive elements start to play a role in my thought process. I experience occasional false starts, where I reconsider the weight given to certain arguments or the relevance of specific contexts. There are also moments of intuitive connection, where I link the discussion on fighting in hockey to broader issues in sports, such as the balance between physicality and safety, or the psychological aspects of competition and aggression.\n\nOne of the tangents I explore is the comparison with other sports, like soccer, as mentioned in the text snippet from document at k=10, which, although slightly off-topic, provides an interesting contrast. This leads me to think about the unique aspects of hockey that might make fighting more acceptable or necessary compared to other sports. Furthermore, the mention of speed and physicality in hockey versus soccer prompts me to consider how these factors contribute to the culture and expectations surrounding fighting in hockey.\n\nStepping back to reassess my thought process and the insights gathered, I realize that the decision on whether fighting should be allowed in hockey is complex and multifaceted. It requires a deep understanding of the sport's culture, the potential risks and benefits of fighting, and the broader implications for player safety and the sport's reputation.\n\nThrough this process of applying the journalistic investigation technique and exploring related threads, I believe the most effective terms for a BM25 index would include those that capture the essence of the debate, such as \"player safety,\" \"hockey culture,\" \"fighting majors,\" \"concussions,\" \"rule changes,\" and \"NHL policy.\" These terms not only reflect the explicit aspects of the query but also encapsulate the implicit nuances and complexities that have emerged from the analysis.\n\nIn conclusion, my thought process has been a dynamic interplay of structured technique and natural cognitive patterns, leading to a richer understanding of the query and its multifaceted nature. By synthesizing insights from both the systematic application of the journalistic investigation technique and the organic connections made during the process, I have arrived at a comprehensive set of terms that can facilitate a more informed and nuanced discussion on whether fighting should be allowed in hockey.",
