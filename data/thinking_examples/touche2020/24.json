We would effectively eliminate all need for tax lobbyists and special interest if we created a comprehensive tax system, or got rid of corporate tax all together. A small fraction of our government spending is created by corporate tax, which only alienates corporations and creates a disparity between economic centers in their need for unlegislated competition. In accordance with your previous statement, most of these retail jobs are held by the least educated in our society, and whether they are uneducated due to the governments failures or due to their own laziness and lack of willpower is up for discussion. Sources: [1] http://taxfoundation.org... [2]https://cew.georgetown.edu...\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n... While defending tax cuts we must look at the 1980s. I will defend Reaganomics responsibly. You think tax cuts in the 80s were the cause of the rapid growth during that decade? They weren\u2019t. Federal Reserve policies must be credited for that. But that does not mean the Reagan tax cuts were a failure\u2014they were a great success. The benefits from the tax cuts were long term; they increased innovation and heavily contributed to the growth in the 1990s a decade later. According to the American Enterprise Institute, \u201cReagan\u2019s economic legacy is inextricably interwoven with the Information Revolution that the IBM PC helped kick off. ...\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n... In 2000 the US produced three times the manufacturing in China, but now China\"s GNP exceeds the US. (http://www.marketwatch.com... ) However, as seen in the previous paragraph, the distribution of wealth among people has become worse, with rich getting richer and middle class decreasing and poor increasing. At the same time, pollution and product safety has become an increasing issue in China. (http://www.huffingtonpost.com..., http://www.greenpeace.org...) Tariff penalties on imports are different from tariffs. They aren\"t an across the board tax like income tax or sales tax. They are more like a traffic ticket, and the penalties specific to maintain competitiveness. Penalties would be on a case by case basis just as is currently done when there is a non-competitive practice complaint against importers now. Just as with non-competitive practice cases, penalties for lack of regulation compared to US regulations would only be applied when it severely affected US manufacturing\"s ability to compete. Just as traffic tickets encourages drivers to keep traffic laws, the threat of a tariff penalty would encourage importing manufacturer to follow US regulations. ...\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"Does lowering the federal corporate income tax rate create jobs?\"... this makes me think of the broader economic implications, though the user might actually be trying to understand the causal relationship between tax rates and employment. Hmm, not sure yet... The existing reasoning provided highlights a focus on opinionated viewpoints rather than empirical data, suggesting the asker may be looking for diverse perspectives beyond those presented in existing materials.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the strengths mentioned suggest a potentially persuasive argument in favor of lower taxes, while the weaknesses indicate a lack of balanced analysis and reliance on subjective claims. This tells me that the query expansion needs to balance the opinions with factual data and consider various viewpoints.\n\nNow, let me approach this using the Query Expansion via Community Q&A Patterns technique, which involves reframing the query, identifying hidden motivations, and extracting valuable response patterns. This should help because it simulates how real people discuss topics in conversational Q&A contexts, rather than just relying on formal documents.\n\nApplying the technique, I first reframe the original query into different types, such as personal experience questions (\"What is it like to work in a company that has benefited from lower corporate tax rates?\"), advice-seeking questions (\"How should policymakers balance tax cuts with job creation goals?\"), and opinion-based questions (\"What do economists think about the impact of corporate tax rates on employment?\"). This helps to uncover the various facets of the topic and how people might naturally discuss it.\n\nNext, I identify the hidden motivations behind the query, such as seeking validation for a pre-existing belief, looking for evidence to support a policy argument, or trying to understand the complexities of economic policy. Recognizing these motivations allows me to tailor the expanded query to address the underlying concerns and interests of the user.\n\nI also examine the answer archetypes that would be valuable for this query, such as first-person experience narratives from business owners, expert opinions from economists, and nuanced conditional answers that discuss the pros and cons of lower corporate tax rates. By targeting these response patterns, I can create an expanded query that is more likely to elicit useful and informative responses.\n\nAs I analyze the community interactions and vocabulary extraction, I notice common follow-up questions, frequently debated aspects, and clarification requests that people often make when discussing this topic. This helps me to refine the expanded query and ensure that it captures the natural language and concerns of the community.\n\nThrough this process, I realize that the expanded query should focus on the economic impact of corporate tax cuts on employment, job growth, and business hiring practices. The final expanded query, \"economic impact of corporate tax cuts on employment, job growth, business hiring practices,\" emerges logically from both the technique and natural insights. This query is more likely to yield diverse perspectives, empirical data, and practical advice, addressing the user's underlying motivations and concerns.\n\nBy applying the Query Expansion via Community Q&A Patterns technique and balancing structured steps with natural thought patterns, I believe the expanded query effectively captures the complexities of the topic and simulates how real people discuss it in conversational Q&A contexts.",
