The ability to charge premium prices for faster speeds is what gives ISPs incentive to create faster, better, more reliable Internet services. The US Postal Service example is directly on point: no one has any problem with Express Mail (which costs more). Why should there by any problem with faster Internet lanes, for which companies can charge more. Always keep in mind that business practices which are legitimately anticompetitive -- practices that harm consumers or competition -- are already covered under the antitrust laws, so there's no need to create another layer of regulation, especially a rule so rigid and categorical as requiring net neutrality across-the-board, regardless of the circumstances and potential pro-competitive benefits. 4. Con says a net neutrality law is necessary to protect our privacy. But that's simply not true. What we need are stronger privacy laws, not a rigid net neutrality law. ...\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n... Pro needs to show that the reason that because Internet is lacking in Europe is a consequence of the establishment of broadband as a public utility. He, and the article he refers to, only cites a correlation between the two, not a causal relationship. There are other factors that should be taken into account eg. regarding broadband coverage, the discrepancy could be explained by the fact that the U.S is much richer than many European countries such as Moldova, Romania, and Bulgaria.c) Cheng et.al in their paper The Debate on Net Neutrality: A Policy Perspective show that the opposite is the case. ...\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n... Further, such restrictions by monopolies or large ISP\u2019s actually makes the dissolution of monopolies more likely, as smaller startup companies would receive more subscribers and users as they became more restricted by the larger providers. In the end, the market regulates itself better than the FCC can possibly hope to. -It is important to note that a lack of net neutrality laws doesn\u2019t infringe on the consumers access to Internet. It simply means they pay for the access they want. Whatever access they don\u2019t have, they aren\u2019t paying for. Sources: [1] - http://en.wikipedia.org... [2] - http://www.savetheinternet.com...

  "thought_process": "As I delve into the query \"Should net neutrality be restored?\", my initial impression is that this is a complex, multifaceted issue that touches on principles of internet governance, freedom of information, and economic regulation. The user's query suggests a desire to understand the arguments for and against net neutrality, which implies a need to explore both the theoretical underpinnings and the practical implications of this concept.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the strengths and weaknesses highlight the importance of concrete examples and a deeper exploration of potential benefits alongside perceived risks. This suggests that a straightforward, binary approach to the question may not suffice; instead, we need to consider the nuances and trade-offs involved in net neutrality.\n\nTo structure my approach, I'll employ the journalistic investigation technique, treating this query as if I were a researcher building a comprehensive story on the subject. The first step is query assessment, where I identify assumptions, knowledge gaps, and unexpressed needs. In this case, the user may be assuming that net neutrality is inherently good or bad, without fully considering the complexities of internet governance and the roles of ISPs.\n\nNext, I'll identify diverse real-world scenarios where this query is relevant, including professional contexts (e.g., telecommunications industries), educational settings (e.g., courses on internet governance), personal situations (e.g., individuals concerned about online privacy), and specialized communities (e.g., net neutrality advocacy groups). This helps me understand the various stakeholders and their interests in the net neutrality debate.\n\nNow, let's move on to resource investigation, where I'll identify authoritative sources of information on this topic. Notable experts and their key contributions, established methodologies, and essential terminology will all be essential in building a comprehensive understanding of net neutrality. I'll also examine organizations, institutions, and communities involved in the debate, such as the FCC, ISPs, and advocacy groups.\n\nThe headline creation step allows me to approach the query from multiple angles, crafting headlines that could introduce articles addressing the query from different perspectives. For example: \"The Net Neutrality Debate: A Primer\", \"The Economic Implications of Restoring Net Neutrality\", or \"Net Neutrality and Online Privacy: What You Need to Know\". These headlines help me extract specific terms related to the query, such as \"internet access\", \"data prioritization\", \"digital economy\", and \"innovation\".\n\nAs I apply the journalistic investigation technique, I start to see connections between the different aspects of net neutrality. For instance, the concept of data prioritization is closely tied to the economic implications of net neutrality, as ISPs may charge premium prices for faster speeds. This, in turn, raises questions about the role of government regulation in ensuring a free and open internet.\n\nThe systematic application of the technique's steps is complemented by my natural thought patterns, which occasionally lead to false starts or reconsiderations. For example, I initially thought that net neutrality was primarily a matter of online privacy, but as I delved deeper, I realized that it's a more complex issue involving economic, social, and technological factors. I also noticed that my intuition sometimes prompted me to explore tangential topics, such as the history of internet governance or the impact of net neutrality on innovation.\n\nThroughout this process, I'm balancing the structured approach with my natural cognitive patterns, allowing me to make connections and insights that might not have emerged through a purely systematic approach. The technique provides a framework for organizing my thoughts, while my intuition and experience help me to identify patterns and relationships that are not immediately apparent.\n\nAs I synthesize my findings, I realize that the key to understanding net neutrality lies in considering multiple perspectives and evaluating the evidence from various sources. The final terms that emerge from this process \u2013 \"impact of net neutrality on internet access, data prioritization, and the digital economy\" \u2013 capture the essence of the query and provide a foundation for further exploration.\n\nThrough this process of applying the journalistic investigation technique and exploring related threads, I believe that these terms would be most effective for a BM25 index. They capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, providing a comprehensive understanding of the net neutrality debate.",
