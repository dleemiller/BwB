They do apply to the resolution, \"Performance-enhancing drugs should [not] be allowed in professional sports\". They show that using these drugs is unsafe. \"Your part two arguments apply to \"Should children be encouraged to look into athletes as role models? \" No, I'm saying that performance-enhancing drugs should not be allowed because they set a bad example for children. \"Your part three argument applies to \"Should sports leagues concerned with an image of 'hard work' or 'fairness' allow steroid users to play? \" No, I'm saying that performance-enhancing drugs cheat users out of hard work and practice that other players have to go through. \"The resolution at hand, however, is whether it should be ILLEGAL for professional athletes to use these drugs. \" Uh, no, it's whether \"Performance-enhancing drugs should be ALLOWED in professional sports. \" \"Allowed\" and \"legal\" are very different. \"Allowed\" means allowed within the sport's rules; \"legal\" means allowed within the law.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n... This is the main rationale for trying to ban steroids and other forms of doping from athletic competitions.\" Gary Becker, PhD Professor in the Departments of Economics, Sociology, and the Graduate School of Business at the University of Chicago \"Doping in Sports,\" Becker-Posner blog Aug. 27, 2006 THINK MORE !\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: Levels the playing field. Currently suspicion over drug use surrounds every sport and every successful athlete, and those competitors who don\u2019t take performance-enhancing drugs see themselves as disadvantaged. Some drugs can\u2019t be tested for, and in any case, new medical and chemical advances mean that the cheats will always be ahead of the testers. Legalisation would remove this uncertainty and allow everyone to compete openly and fairly.\n",
  "thought_process": "As I delve into the query \"Should performance-enhancing drugs be accepted in sports?\", my initial impression is that this is a complex issue with multiple facets, including ethical, health, and competitive balance considerations. It makes me think of the moral dilemmas athletes and sports organizations face, the potential long-term health consequences for athletes who use these drugs, and the impact on the integrity of sports competitions. The user might be trying to understand the arguments for and against the acceptance of performance-enhancing drugs, but there's also a deeper exploration needed into the implications of such acceptance on various stakeholders, including athletes, teams, and the broader sports community.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that there are diverse perspectives on the issue. Some arguments focus on the health risks associated with the use of performance-enhancing drugs, while others highlight the importance of fair play and competitive balance. The text snippets from the initial results provide valuable insights, such as the differentiation between \"allowed\" and \"legal\" in the context of performance-enhancing drugs in sports, and the rationale for banning steroids and other forms of doping from athletic competitions.\n\nTransitioning to a structured approach, I decide to apply the \"Query Expansion Through Journalistic Investigation\" technique. This involves treating the query as a story to be comprehensively researched and understood. The technique requires assessing the query, identifying real-world contexts, investigating resources, creating headlines, and extracting terms. By doing so, I aim to uncover a richer set of terms and concepts that can enhance the search query and provide a more nuanced understanding of the topic.\n\nApplying the steps of the technique systematically, I start by assessing the query to understand what the user is truly seeking. This involves identifying assumptions, knowledge gaps, and unexpressed needs. For instance, the user may be assuming that performance-enhancing drugs are inherently bad, but there might be contexts where their use is seen as beneficial or necessary. I also recognize the need to consider diverse real-world scenarios where this query is relevant, including professional sports leagues, educational settings, and personal health contexts.\n\nAs I investigate resources, I come across notable experts and their contributions, such as Gary Becker's insights on doping in sports. I also identify essential terminology and specialized vocabulary related to performance-enhancing drugs, such as \"steroids,\" \"doping,\" and \"competitive advantage.\" The creation of diverse headlines helps me to address the query from multiple angles, including beginner-oriented explanations, expert-level analyses, and historical or future-focused perspectives.\n\nHowever, as I apply the technique, I also allow for natural cognitive elements to influence my thought process. For example, I consider the potential long-term health consequences for athletes who use performance-enhancing drugs, which leads me to think about the importance of health education and prevention programs in sports. I also have a moment of reconsideration when I think about the argument that legalization of performance-enhancing drugs could level the playing field, making me question whether this could indeed be a viable solution to ensure fair play.\n\nThrough this process, insights begin to emerge from both the structured technique and my natural thought patterns. I realize that the ethical implications of performance-enhancing drugs in sports are complex and multifaceted, involving considerations of individual autonomy, health risks, and competitive balance. The technique helps me to systematically identify key terms and concepts, such as \"fair play,\" \"health risks,\" and \"technological advancements,\" which can enhance the search query.\n\nSynthesizing my findings with clarity, I believe that the expanded query should capture the essence of the ethical debate surrounding performance-enhancing drugs in sports, including considerations of health risks, fair play, and individual autonomy, within the context of technological advancements. The terms extracted through the journalistic investigation technique, combined with my intuitive insights, provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the nuances of this complex issue.",
