  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n... According to a 2000 joint statement by six leading national medical associations including the American Medical Association and American Psychological Association, this escalated fear results in youth not trusting others and taking violent self-protective measures. [33] Violent video games can train youth to be killers. The US Marine Corps licensed Doom II in 1996 to create Marine Doom in order to train soldiers. In 2002, the US Army released first-person shooter America's Army to recruit soldiers and prepare recruits for the battlefield.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n... That would be extremely redundant.1C - The Definition of ViolenceViolence is not limited to actions which result in the imminent harm of another person. vi\u00b7o\u00b7lence [vahy-uh-luhns] noun 1. swift and intense force: the violence of a storm. 2. rough or injurious physical force, action, or treatment: to die by violence. 3. an unjust or unwarranted exertion of force or power, as against rights or laws: to take over agovernment by violence 4. a violent act or proceeding. 5. rough or immoderate vehemence, as of feeling or language: the violence of his hatred. B. ArgumentsB1 - Violent Video Games cause worrisome violence, and all violence is worrisomeMost especially in youth, the exertion of noticeable or otherwise untriggered violence is abnormal and signatory of deviation in the proper growth and functioning of their brain. If someone exhibits violent behaviour, then that should be inherently major enough for those who care about them to consider as \"big enough to worry about\". ...\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n...

  "thought_process": "As I delve into the query \"Do violent video games contribute to youth violence?\", my initial impression is that this is a complex issue with multiple facets. It makes me think of the various studies and debates that have been ongoing for years, trying to establish a link between violent video games and real-life aggression in youth. However, I also consider the possibility that the relationship might not be as straightforward as it seems, and there could be other factors at play.\n\nUpon analyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the top documents provide a mix of opinions and research findings. Some snippets, like the one from document at k=1, suggest that violent video games can indeed train youth to be more aggressive, citing examples like the US Marine Corps' use of Doom II for training purposes. Other snippets, such as the one from document at k=2, delve into the definition of violence and its implications on youth behavior. I also come across snippets like the one from document at k=10, which mentions books and experts in the field, highlighting the complexity and multifaceted nature of the topic.\n\nTo approach this query expansion systematically, I decide to apply the Temporal Evolution Analysis technique. This involves tracing the historical foundation of the topic, mapping its developmental milestones, assessing the current landscape, projecting emerging trends, and extracting temporally diverse terminology.\n\nStarting with the historical foundation, I consider the early studies on media violence, such as Bandura's social learning theory, and how they laid the groundwork for later research on video game violence. I note the initial concerns about video game violence, the classic research on aggression and desensitization, and the foundational concepts in psychology and sociology that have been applied to this topic.\n\nAs I move on to the developmental milestones, I identify key events like the publication of the American Psychological Association's policy statements on video game violence, the release of controversial video games like Mortal Kombat and Grand Theft Auto, and the emergence of new research methods and technologies. I see how these milestones have shaped the current landscape of the debate, with ongoing discussions about the causal link between violent video games and youth violence, industry efforts to self-regulate, and government initiatives to address the issue.\n\nWhen assessing the current landscape, I notice the diversity of perspectives and the range of research being conducted. I see how the topic has evolved to include concerns about online gaming, cyberbullying, and the potential benefits of video games for therapy and education. I also identify the emerging trends, such as the growing interest in virtual reality and augmented reality technologies, and the increased focus on diversity and representation in video games.\n\nAs I project the future of this topic, I consider how the video game industry might continue to evolve, with new technologies and game designs that could impact our understanding of the relationship between video games and youth violence. I think about how researchers might employ new methods to study this topic, such as using machine learning algorithms to analyze player behavior or conducting longitudinal studies to track the long-term effects of video game exposure.\n\nThrough this process, I start to see a timeline of the topic's evolution, with key terms and concepts emerging at different stages. I extract terms that represent the full temporal spectrum, from the historical foundation to the emerging trends. I notice how terms like \"media violence,\" \"aggression,\" and \"desensitization\" have remained relevant across eras, while new terms like \"gaming disorder,\" \"cyberbullying,\" and \"neurodevelopment\" have gained prominence in recent years.\n\nAs I synthesize my findings, I realize that the expanded query should capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of the user's question. I consider how the terms I've extracted can be combined to create a more nuanced and comprehensive query. I think about how the historical context, current debates, and emerging trends can be woven together to provide a richer understanding of the issue.\n\nThrough this process of applying the Temporal Evolution Analysis technique and exploring related threads, I believe the following terms would be most effective for a BM25 index: \"violent video games,\" \"youth violence,\" \"mental health,\" \"social behavior,\" \"temporal evolution,\" \"media violence,\" \"aggression,\" \"desensitization,\" \"gaming disorder,\" \"cyberbullying,\" \"neurodevelopment,\" and \"cognitive function.\" These terms capture the complexity and multifaceted nature of the topic, and can help retrieve relevant documents that provide a comprehensive understanding of the issue.",
