Further on, in states where there is no direct to consumer advertising but there is advertising to doctors, patients are disadvantaged because it is in the interest for private medical insurance firms or national health services to keep information about expensive new drugs from patients. In the UK it was because of cost that the Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) refused to allow the prescription of Herceptin, a drug which US studies have shown reduces the damage done by breast cancer. Ultimately pressure from Roche, the drug\u2019s manufacturer and from patients resulted in the drug being authorized for use, but the process was much faster in the US where Roche could run advertisements alerting consumers to the potential benefits of Herceptin, and thereby immediately giving patients access to a similar level of information as their doctors and allowing them to push for its authorization. \u00a0 [1]\u00a0Patient View \u2013 for improving patient care, Information on prescription medicines: the views of EU-based patient groups,\u00a0http://www.patient-view.com/projects4.htm, accessed 08/07/2011 [2]\u00a0Lyles A., Direct Marketing of Pharmaceuticals to Consumers, Annual Review of Public Health, published May 2002,\u00a0\u00a0http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.publhealth.23.100901.140537, accessed 08/08/2011\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n... In this regard, the restrictions on the pharma industry contrast with the freedom enjoyed by manufacturers of vitamins and herbal remedies, who routinely advertise products to patients.\u201d[2]\u00a0This shows that it is unjust to make any differences between the companies. \u00a0 [1]\u00a0Debate: Should Drug Companies be allowed to advertise prescriptions direct to the public.\u00a0http://toostep.com/debate/should-drugs-companies-be-allowed-to-advertise-prescription [2]\u00a0Jessop N., Will DTC Advertising appear in Europe ?, published 01/07/2011,\u00a0\u00a0http://pharmtech.findpharma.com/pharmtech/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=702161, accessed 07/29/2011\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: Advertisements\u2014especially those that identify symptoms\u2014can lead to a healthier citizenry, as consumers become aware of their diseases earlier, and can thus find the drug that targets their problem at an earlier stage. Many drugs can prevent or reduce the likelihood of a patient requiring surgery (for instance anti-cholesterol drugs can reduce the buildup of atheroma in blood vessels, which cause cardiovascular heart disease and strokes, thus reducing the likelihood of a heart bypass being required and improving any post-stroke rehabilitation). This not only saves money but is also better for patients. Surgery involves the risk of complications as well as taking time both directly and in post-operation rehabilitation. Also many degenerative conditions can be best treated by early intervention; if patients are aware of the drugs that are available at an early stage they are more likely to take them, thereby increasing their standard of living and reducing their long-term cost to state or private health cover providers.\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"Should prescription drugs be advertised directly to consumers?\"... this makes me think of the potential benefits and drawbacks of such advertising, though the user might actually be trying to understand the broader implications on public health, healthcare costs, and the pharmaceutical industry. Initially, I associate this query with concepts like patient empowerment, informed decision-making, and the role of marketing in shaping consumer behavior.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the top documents discuss the pros and cons of direct-to-consumer advertising (DTCA) of prescription drugs. The first snippet highlights the potential for DTCA to inform patients about new treatments and empower them to advocate for their use, citing the example of Herceptin. The second snippet touches on the regulatory aspects and the contrast between the pharmaceutical industry and manufacturers of vitamins and herbal remedies. The tenth snippet argues that DTCA can lead to a healthier citizenry by promoting early awareness and intervention.\n\nTransitioning to a more structured approach, I'll apply the Query Expansion via Temporal Evolution Analysis technique, which involves analyzing how the query topic has evolved through time and will likely develop in the future to discover temporally diverse terminology. This should help because it allows us to capture the historical context, current trends, and future directions of the topic, ultimately enriching our query with relevant terms from various time periods.\n\nStarting with the historical foundation, I identify key milestones such as the Kefauver-Harris Amendment, the rise of mass media, and the 1938 Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The developmental milestones include the 1980s' relaxed FDA enforcement, the 1997 FDA guidance on broadcast ads, and the Vioxx recall. The current landscape is dominated by online advertising, FDA regulations, and debates on information vs. promotion. Emerging trends include personalized medicine advertising, AI-driven ad targeting, and a focus on value-based care.\n\nAs I systematically apply the technique's steps, I notice that the historical context provides a rich background for understanding the evolution of DTCA. The developmental milestones reveal how the industry and regulatory environment have shaped the current state of DTCA. The current landscape highlights the complexities and challenges of balancing information and promotion in advertising. The emerging trends suggest a future where technology and personalized approaches will play a significant role in DTCA.\n\nInterspersing these structured steps with natural thought patterns, I have occasional false starts or reconsiderations, such as wondering whether the focus on value-based care might overshadow the importance of patient empowerment. I also make intuitive connections, like recognizing that the rise of digital advertising has transformed the way pharmaceutical companies interact with consumers. Brief tangents, such as considering the impact of social media on DTCA, sometimes yield unexpected insights, like the potential for influencers to shape consumer perceptions of prescription drugs.\n\nThrough this process, insights emerge from both the structured technique and my intuitive connections. Applying the Temporal Evolution Analysis leads me to discover terms like \"patent medicines,\" \"Kefauver-Harris Amendment,\" and \"AI-driven targeting,\" which capture the temporal spectrum of the topic. My natural thought patterns and intuitive leaps help me synthesize these terms into a cohesive narrative, highlighting the complexities and nuances of DTCA.\n\nSynthesizing my findings with clarity, I believe that the expanded query should include terms that represent the full temporal spectrum of the topic, from historical foundations to emerging trends. The final expanded query, \"prescription drugs advertised directly consumers patent medicines kefauver harris amendment fda guidance 1997 vioxx recall online advertising digital ai driven targeting value based care,\" captures the essence of the user's query and provides a comprehensive framework for exploring the topic.",
