'Baby boomers' are projected to lose roughly 5 cents of every dollar they earn to the OASI program in taxes net of benefits. Young adults who came of age in the early 1990s and today's children are on course to lose over 7 cents of every dollar they earn in net taxes. If OASI taxes were to be raised immediately by the amount needed to pay for OASI benefits on an on-going basis, baby boomers would forfeit 6 cents of every dollar they earn in net OASI taxes. For those born later it would be 10 cents.[3] Change could be implemented gradually. Andrew Roth argues: \u201cWhile Americans in retirement or approaching retirement would probably stay in the current system [if Social Security were to be privatized], younger workers should have the option to invest a portion of their money in financial assets other than U.S. Treasuries. These accounts would be the ultimate \"lock box\" - they would prevent politicians in Washington from raiding the Trust Fund. ...\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n...

People do not get the same amount of money as someone did 30 years ago. Soon all of the baby boomers will reach retirement age and the social security funds will dry up. Most of these social security funds will come from younger Americans. http://en.wikipedia.org......(United_States)#Claim_that_it_is_a_pyramid_scheme 2) Social security discriminates against the poor, as they pay an extra social security tax. http://en.wikipedia.org......(United_States)#Claim_that_it_discriminates_against_the_poor_and_middle-class 3) It gives a very low amount of money back. http://en.wikipedia.org......(United_States)#Claim_that_it_gives_a_low_rate_of_return 4) I recommend that the social security system sets up private savings accounts. These savings will not be used for government purposes and they will not be moved to other accounts unless decided so by the owner of the account.\n",
  "thought_process": "As I delve into the query \"Should social security be privatized?\", my initial impression is that this is a complex issue with multiple facets. It's not just about the financial implications, but also about the ethical and societal impacts of such a significant change. The user is likely seeking a balanced analysis of the pros and cons, including the potential benefits and drawbacks of replacing the existing public social security system with a private retirement savings model.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the top documents provide a range of perspectives on the issue. Some argue that privatization would be beneficial, citing the potential for higher returns on investment and the ability for individuals to have more control over their retirement savings. Others argue that privatization would be detrimental, citing the risks associated with market volatility and the potential for unequal access to retirement savings.\n\nTo expand on this query, I will apply the \"Query Expansion Through Journalistic Investigation\" technique. This approach involves treating the query as a research topic and applying investigative research techniques to discover related real-world terms and concepts.\n\nFirst, I assess the query to determine what the user is truly seeking. It appears that the user wants to understand the implications of privatizing social security, including the potential impact on individual retirement security and the role of government in providing social safety nets.\n\nNext, I identify diverse real-world scenarios where this query is relevant. For example, this query could be relevant in professional contexts, such as in the financial industry or in government policy-making. It could also be relevant in educational settings, such as in courses on economics or public policy. Additionally, this query could be relevant in personal situations, such as when individuals are planning for retirement or seeking to understand the implications of social security reform.\n\nI then investigate real, authoritative sources of information on this topic. This includes notable experts, such as economists and policy analysts, as well as established methodologies and approaches, such as cost-benefit analysis and scenario planning. I also identify essential terminology and specialized vocabulary, such as \"defined benefit plan\" and \"defined contribution plan\".\n\nAs I create headlines that could introduce articles addressing the query from multiple angles, I consider the following:\n\n* \"The Future of Social Security: Weighing the Pros and Cons of Privatization\"\n* \"Social Security Reform: A Guide to Understanding the Options\"\n* \"The Economics of Social Security: How Privatization Could Impact Retirement Savings\"\n* \"The Politics of Social Security: A Look at the Debate Over Privatization\"\n* \"Retirement Security in the 21st Century: The Role of Social Security and Private Savings\"\n\nFrom these headlines, I extract specific terms that represent precise concepts related to the query. These include:\n\n* Social security\n* Privatization\n* Retirement savings\n* Individual accounts\n* Investment risk\n* Market volatility\n* Government safety net\n* Generational equity\n* Economic sustainability\n\nAs I apply the technique, I notice that the terms \"investment risk\" and \"market volatility\" are closely related to the concept of privatization. This leads me to consider the potential risks associated with market fluctuations and how they could impact individual retirement savings. I also notice that the term \"generational equity\" is relevant, as it highlights the potential impact of privatization on different age groups.\n\nThrough this process, I begin to see the query in a new light. I realize that the issue of social security privatization is complex and multifaceted, and that there are many different perspectives and considerations that need to be taken into account. I also see that the technique of query expansion through journalistic investigation can be a powerful tool for uncovering related real-world terms and concepts, and for developing a deeper understanding of the query.\n\nAs I synthesize the insights and terms that have emerged from this process, I believe that the following terms would be most effective for a BM25 index: \"social security privatization\", \"retirement savings\", \"investment risk\", \"market volatility\", \"government safety net\", and \"generational equity\". These terms capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, and they provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the complex issue of social security privatization.",
