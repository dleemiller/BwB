CONTENTION 1. Children Being Denied a Basic Education Vaccination is no prerequisite to anything. Regardless of Age, ethnicity, social and economic background, children should have the right to attend School. According to many Constitutional and Laws Globally, this would infringe on the Act of Liberty, and Free will, in accordance with the First Amendment of the US constitution.(1) CONTENTION 2. Denial of Free will As stated Above, this would infringe on the act of Free will, a Basic right that all Humans should have, regardless. REFUTATIONS \"Although it is ultimately up to the parents on whether they wish to vaccinate thier kids, I think it breaks a social contract to exclude your child from vaccination and place them into an environment that may put your child and other children at risk.\" ...\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: Medical exemptions These are allowed when a child has a medical condition or allergy that may make receiving the vaccine dangerous. All 50 states allow medical exemptions. For school entry purposes, these exemptions require a physician's note supporting the medical necessity of the exemption. Religious exemptions These are allowed when immunizations are not in agreement with the parents' religious beliefs. Forty-eight of the 50 states allow these exemptions. Philosophical exemptions These are allowed when non-religious, but strongly held beliefs, prevent a parent from allowing their child to be immunized. Twenty states allow these exemptions. In certain situations an exemption can be challenged by the state. ...\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n... As it does not contain the whole microbe, there is a severely decreased chance of a complication. Recombinant subunit vaccines were created and tested to treat hepatitis B. Scientists testing this vaccine inserted specific antigens into bakers bread and the yeast reproduced the antigens allowing them to collect more. Doctors and scientists are currently testing similar techniques to treat hepatitis C. Toxoid vaccines are used when a toxic bacteria is concerned. When the body is introduced to the toxoid created in a lab (harmless to the body) it learns to fight it off, creating an immune response. The body produces antigens that lock onto and block the toxoid. These vaccines have been used to treat diphtheria and tetanus. ...\n",
  "thought_process": "As I delve into the query \"Should any vaccines be required for children?\", my initial thoughts revolve around the polarized debate surrounding vaccines and the necessity of understanding the historical context, scientific consensus, and ethical considerations. The query itself is quite broad, encompassing not just the medical aspects of vaccines but also the legal, ethical, and societal implications of making them mandatory for children. \n\nLooking at the initial results from the query, such as the text snippets provided, it becomes clear that the discussion is multifaceted, involving constitutional rights, medical exemptions, religious beliefs, and the scientific basis of vaccine efficacy and safety. For instance, the mention of weighing the cost of a child receiving a possible illness from remaining unvaccinated against the premise of being denied basic education highlights the complexity of the issue. It also brings to the forefront the importance of balancing individual rights with public health concerns.\n\nTo systematically approach this query expansion, I'll utilize the Temporal Evolution Analysis technique. This involves analyzing how the topic of vaccine requirements for children has evolved over time and is likely to develop in the future, thereby discovering temporally diverse terminology.\n\nStarting with the historical foundation, it's essential to trace the origins of vaccination, from ancient inoculation practices to the development of the first vaccines, such as Edward Jenner's smallpox vaccine. Understanding these foundational concepts helps in identifying historical approaches and methodologies now considered classic. For example, the germ theory of disease, which emerged in the mid-1800s, was a pivotal moment in the development of vaccination practices.\n\nMoving on to developmental milestones, mapping key evolutionary stages in vaccine development, such as mass vaccination campaigns, the eradication of smallpox, and the introduction of childhood vaccination schedules, provides insight into how terminology and approaches have transformed over time. The rise of the anti-vaccine movement and the subsequent scientific evidence debunking the link between vaccines and autism are also crucial points of consideration.\n\nAssessing the current landscape involves looking at the contemporary state of vaccine development, including the scientific consensus on vaccine safety and effectiveness, public health benefits of herd immunity, and concerns about vaccine hesitancy and misinformation. The use of terms like \"vaccine hesitancy\" and \"herd immunity\" in current discourse reflects the ongoing evolution of the topic.\n\nProjecting how the topic is likely to evolve involves identifying emerging trends, technologies, or approaches, such as mRNA technology in vaccine development, personalized vaccines, and nanoparticle-based vaccine delivery systems. These advancements not only introduce new terminology but also signify a shift towards more targeted and efficient vaccination strategies.\n\nThrough this process of Temporal Evolution Analysis, it becomes apparent that the query expansion should include terms that reflect the historical context, current scientific understanding, and future directions of vaccine development. Terms such as \"history of childhood vaccination,\" \"efficacy of vaccines,\" \"vaccine safety concerns,\" \"impact of anti-vaccine movements,\" and \"future directions in vaccine development\" capture the essence of the query's complexity. Additionally, considering ethical considerations of mandatory vaccination and the impact on public health highlights the need for a comprehensive approach to the topic.\n\nThe application of the Temporal Evolution Analysis technique, combined with natural cognitive patterns such as reconsiderations and intuitive connections, allows for a systematic yet flexible approach to query expansion. This method not only ensures that the expanded query is comprehensive but also that it captures the dynamic and evolving nature of the topic.\n\nIn conclusion, the thought process behind expanding the query \"Should any vaccines be required for children?\" involves a deep dive into the historical, current, and future aspects of vaccine development and its societal implications. By applying the Temporal Evolution Analysis technique and incorporating natural thought patterns, the expanded query can effectively capture the complexity and breadth of the topic, leading to more informative and relevant search results.",
