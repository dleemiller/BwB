  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n... A federal minimum wage increase to this level would give good data for policy makers and a better understanding for economists. Most of CON\u2019s arguments prove my point that we need good data that we can only get from a large increase in the federal minimum wage. For example, one main source for CON is a blog page from a software developer and CEO of a software company.[6] He is possibly a great guy, but not an authority on government policy and economics.CON basically ignores the position of the US Dept. Of Labor.Please read here to see them refute his fallacies one by one.http://www.dol.gov...Vote PRO The federal minimum wage should be raised to $15 an hour.[1] http://ew-econ.typepad.fr...[2] http://www.dol.gov...[3] http://journalistsresource.org...[4] http://davidcard.berkeley.edu...[5] www.thinkprogress.org/economy/2015/08/03/3687171/15-minimum-wage-big-mac/[6] http://wheniwork.com...\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: The argument that raising the federal minimum wage would cost business owners more money, and thus force them to either lay off workers or not bring on additional workers, seems to assume that the only factor effecting unemployment is the finances of those employing the workforce. Instead, raising the federal minimum wage may work to incentivize people who have previously relied on welfare to seek employment. As the federal minimum wage stands, there are people who feel it is not worth their time to work for the minimum wage, and instead would be able to sustain a lifestyle they are comfortable with by continuing to stay on welfare for as long as they can. The argument that raising the minimum wage would increase \"overall costs\" seems to be reasonable in the short-term; in that, business owners would likely try to compensate for the increased wages of their employees. ...\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: Thanks for a punctual response, Con. On to my rebuttals. Primary Objectives Of Minimum Wage Laws It seems like you don't agree with me on what the objectives of minimum wage laws are. You cite a paper that offers an opinion on the purpose of the Federal Minimum Wage when it was first enacted: \u201cThe purpose of the minimum wage was to stabilize the post-depression economy and protect the workers in the labor force.\u201d There are 2 problems with this. First, the Great Depression was long ago, so this is no longer relevant; your source says that was the purpose, implying that it is not the purpose today. Second, your paper effectively admits that this may not actually have been the true purpose, since it goes on to say that: \u201cOthers have argued that the primary purpose was [something else]\u201d Since you have not offered an alternative explanation for what the primary goals of minimum wage laws are, only what they were, we are left with the same 2 objectives that I listed in the previous round: decreasing unemployment and poverty. You say that minimum wage laws aren't directed at reducing poverty. ...\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"Should the federal minimum wage be increased?\"... this makes me think of the broader economic implications, though the user might actually be trying to understand the arguments for and against such a policy change. Hmm, not sure yet, but it seems like we're dealing with a complex issue that involves multiple stakeholders and factors.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the documents retrieved focus on arguments and data related to the effects of increasing the federal minimum wage. The strengths of these results lie in their ability to provide insights into the potential consequences of such a policy change, while the weaknesses include the lack of diverse perspectives and the potential for biased information.\n\nTo expand this query, I'll use the technique of conceptual graph traversal, which involves constructing a graph with core concepts and entities from the query and then traversing it to find high-value expansion terms. This approach should help me identify related concepts and arguments that can enhance the query and improve document retrieval.\n\nStarting with the core concepts, I have \"federal minimum wage\" and \"increase.\" The first-order connections include properties like \"economic impacts,\" \"employment,\" and \"poverty.\" Second-order connections might involve related concepts like \"living wage,\" \"income inequality,\" and \"cost of living.\" Domain contexts include economics, policy, and sociology.\n\nNow, let's select some expansion paths. One promising direction is to explore synonymous terms, such as \"living wage\" or \"minimum wage increase.\" Another path is to examine hierarchical terms, like \"economic indicators\" or \"legislation.\" Compositional terms, such as \"job creation\" or \"wage stagnation,\" could also be useful. Contextual terms, like \"state minimum wage\" or \"local minimum wage,\" might provide additional insights.\n\nAs I traverse the graph, I'll extract high-value terms and filter them based on relevance, distinctiveness, specificity, and searchability. This process should yield a set of expansion terms that can enhance the original query and provide more accurate retrieval results.\n\nApplying the conceptual graph traversal technique, I've identified the following expansion terms: \"living wage,\" \"income inequality,\" \"poverty threshold,\" \"job creation,\" \"wage stagnation,\" \"cost of living,\" and \"purchasing power.\" These terms seem to capture the essence of the policy debate surrounding the federal minimum wage increase.\n\nThrough this process of applying the conceptual graph traversal technique and exploring related threads, I believe the expanded query should include terms like \"federal minimum wage,\" \"increase,\" \"living wage,\" \"income inequality,\" \"poverty threshold,\" \"job creation,\" and \"cost of living.\" These terms should provide a more comprehensive understanding of the topic and improve document retrieval.\n\nIn synthesizing the results, I'm confident that the expanded query will capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of the user's search intent. By incorporating terms that reflect the economic, social, and policy dimensions of the issue, we can create a more effective search query that yields relevant and informative results.",
