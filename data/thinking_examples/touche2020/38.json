  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n... Not even the first choice. Medical marijuana would not replace current medical practices, it would only supplement them. The legalization of medical marijuana is bad for many reasons, which brings me to my next point. . http://www.post-gazette.com... 2. Ill Effects of Ingesting Marijuana The Office of Drug Control Policy says the following, \"Marijuana use is associated with dependence, respiratory and mental illness, poor motor performance, and impaired cognitive and immune system functioning, among other negative effects. Marijuana intoxication can cause distorted perceptions, difficulty in thinking and problem solving, and problems with learning and memory. Studies have shown an association between chronic marijuana use and increased rates of anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts, and schizophrenia. Other research has shown marijuana smoke to contain carcinogens and to be an irritant to the lungs. Marijuana smoke, in fact, contains 50\u201070 percent more carcinogenic hydrocarbons than does tobacco smoke,\" This goes to show why any use of marijuana, even for medical uses, is a bad thing for the health of any users. ...\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: My opponent provides no source for the bold claim that up to forty percent of persons with BP disorder cannot tolerate standard treatment medications, or any suggestion of logic or evidence that cannaboids would be an exception. Even if my opponent's doubtful claims are true, the minimal impact of medical marijuana is easily negated by the 400+ toxins found in the substance. Additionally, THC has never been used as a controlled substance in the study of BP disorder, directly contradicting my opponents assumption that cannaboids could be used to combat the disease. Furthermore, marijuana has been proven to heighten the risk and intensity of the depressive states of bipolar disorder. My opponent's second main point is completely irrelevant. Unnecessary and harmful freedoms are not handed out to the terminally ill simply to ensure that they have a pleasant trip out of life. Doing such sets an unneeded and negative precedent to the rest of society. Honestly, \"happiness\" isn't an idea that falls under the umbrella of medicine, and the Affirmative plan draws no line if happiness was an acceptable use for medical marijuana. ...\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n... Medical marijuana has not gone through enough patient safety testing and clinical efficancy trials. It is classified as a quote \"Schedule 1\" substance meaning high potential for abuse and no medical value. Harmful effects: There are over 400 chemicals in the marijuana plant, the main one being HTC. Some immediate effects of this drug are a faster heart beat, reduction of short term memory and the reduction of concentration. Long term users of the drug may become dependant on it. Which means that they would have a hard time limiting usage of the drug. Affect on schools: The earlier people start using drugs that they will likely start using more powerful drugs, causing young users not to do school work. Marijuana effects the ability to think, reading comprehension and verbal skills, When students are \"high\" they do not retain what is being taught to them. Therefore for those reasons we should not legelize marijuana for medical use.\n",
  "thought_process": "As I delve into the query \"Should marijuana be a medical option?\", my initial thoughts are centered around the complexities of this debate. I think about the various stakeholders involved - patients, medical professionals, policymakers, and the general public - each with their own perspectives and concerns. The query seems straightforward, but I know that beneath the surface lies a web of ethical, scientific, and social considerations.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the strengths lie in the structured arguments presented, with a focus on evidence-based reasoning. However, the weaknesses indicate a lack of exploration beyond existing medications and a narrow scope of discussion. This suggests to me that users seeking information on this topic might be looking for more diverse perspectives, real-world experiences, and a deeper understanding of the implications of medical marijuana.\n\nMy next step is to apply the query expansion technique via community Q&A patterns. I reframe the original query into various question types, such as personal experience questions (\"What is it like to use medical marijuana for a specific condition?\"), advice-seeking questions (\"How can I decide if medical marijuana is right for me?\"), and opinion-based questions (\"What do medical professionals think about the effectiveness of medical marijuana?\"). I also consider the hidden motivations behind the query, such as the desire for validation, personal decision support, or insider knowledge not found in formal sources.\n\nAs I examine the answer archetypes, I look for patterns that can inform my query expansion. I identify the value in first-person experience narratives, expert opinions with credibility markers, and step-by-step practical advice. I also note the importance of nuanced \"it depends\" conditional answers and contrarian or alternative viewpoints.\n\nThrough this process, I begin to see the emergence of a more comprehensive and nuanced query. I consider the community interactions and how questions evolve through comments and discussions. I extract terminology from emotional and subjective language, personal context descriptions, and informal explanations. The expanded query starts to take shape, incorporating terms like \"medical marijuana effectiveness studies\", \"personal experiences\", \"legal access\", \"affordability\", and \"different consumption methods\".\n\nAs I reflect on my thought process, I realize that the application of the query expansion technique has allowed me to systematically uncover the complexities of the original query. By balancing structured steps with natural thought patterns, I have been able to identify key themes, motivations, and terminology that can inform a more effective search query. The final expanded query, \"medical marijuana effectiveness studies personal experiences legal access affordability different consumption methods\", captures the essence of what users might be seeking when exploring the topic of medical marijuana.\n\nThrough this process of applying the query expansion technique and exploring related threads, I believe that the expanded query terms are most effective for capturing the nuances of the topic. They reflect a deep understanding of the user's needs, concerns, and motivations, and can ultimately lead to more relevant and informative search results.",
