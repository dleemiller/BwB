  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: To clarify, I will be arguing that the government's \"forgiveness\" of consumer debt through bankruptcy is wrong. Arguments will be focused on Ch. 7 bankruptcies. The First Round will be for acceptance only and any additional definitions. Libertarianism - A political philosophy that believes people should be allowed to do and say what they want, so long as it doesn't infringe on the rights of another person, without interference from the government. Ch. 7 Bankruptcy - The legal process by which all obligations to pay all general unsecured debt is discharged (wiped away). Secured debt is rarely discharged in any bankruptcy. Debt - Any obligation to pay another person/company. Debt can be contractual or court ordered (child support, lawsuits, etc...). General unsecured debt - All debt that is not secured by any collateral property. Such debt includes, but is not limited to, credit cards, medical bills, and payday loans. Secured debt - Any debt that is secured by some form of collateral property. Such debt includes, but is not limited to, home mortgages and car loans.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n... You can't get rid of what you owe to the IRS with bankruptcy. but you can pay the IRS off with credit cards.If you have $50,000 is student loans or $50,000 you owe to the IRS, it would be very simple to just pay them off with credit cards and declare bankruptcy. Starting life with a zero balance rather than -$50,000 is much better. If no bankruptcy, in 20 years you would have the money paid back and be at zero or with bankruptcy, you could save money and be at +$50,000 or more due to interest. That's worth it!If you don't have college debt or IRS debt, it would still be worth spending the $50,000. You can buy new car, fly around the world, get new clothes and electronic devices.If you declare bankruptcy, they can't take any of that away from you. The car should last you 7 years so you wouldn't need a car loan again. Instead of spending 20 years to pay the $50,000 back, you can start at zero with $50,000 worth of things and SAVE money instead of paying back credit cards. Not only is it worth it, You'd be crazy NOT to do it! You get $50,000 for free and in return you get a mark on your record that nobody will care about after 7 years.No brainier!\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n... C4) People who change their minds My opponent says that if a child does not attend college or drops out, parents can liquidate the college fund. However, people often change their minds and decide to attend college later in life. These people would not be able to afford college without student loans. C5) Stock market crashes Often, people save for college by investing their money in the stock market. A downturn would erase someone's college savings, necessitating student loans. C6) Lower attendance Since many people would now not be able to afford tuition, fewer people would attend college, law school, medical school, graduate school, and business school. Educational declines over a period of many years would erase trillions of dollars from the U.S. economy, as people become manual laborers instead of engineers, doctors, and lawyers. For all of the above reasons, I urge a Pro vote. ==Citations== [1] http://tinyurl.com... [2] http://tinyurl.com... [3] http://tinyurl.com... [4] http://tinyurl.com... [5] http://tinyurl.com...

  "thought_process": "As I delve into the query \"Should student loan debt be easier to discharge in bankruptcy?\", I'm immediately struck by the complexity and emotional weight of the issue. It makes me think of the countless individuals burdened by debt, their futures hindered by the financial obligations they've taken on to pursue education. The user might be trying to understand the moral, economic, and social implications of making student loan debt more accessible to bankruptcy laws. My initial impression is that this is a multifaceted problem, requiring a nuanced exploration of not just financial and legal aspects, but also the human impact.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the discussion often revolves around the moral and economic implications of discharging student loan debt through bankruptcy. There are arguments both for and against, highlighting the need for a balanced perspective that considers the potential consequences on individuals and the economy. The strengths of the current search terms lie in their ability to spark a broad discussion, but a weakness is the lack of depth in exploring alternative solutions or the long-term effects of current policies.\n\nTo systematically approach this query expansion, I'll utilize the technique of metaphorical thinking. This involves generating powerful metaphors for understanding the topic and mining them for conceptually related terminology from diverse domains. The process begins with metaphor generation, where I create metaphors such as \"student loans as an anchor,\" \"the education system as a factory,\" \"debt forgiveness as a life raft,\" \"college degrees as a gilded cage,\" and \"bankruptcy as a lighthouse.\" These metaphors are chosen from varied domains to provide a rich tapestry of perspectives.\n\nAs I map these metaphors to the domain of student loan debt, I note the correspondences between elements of the source domain and the target domain. For instance, the \"anchor\" metaphor highlights the burden of debt, while the \"factory\" metaphor suggests a system that mass-produces indebted graduates. The \"life raft\" and \"lighthouse\" metaphors offer hopeful perspectives on debt forgiveness and bankruptcy as means to financial relief. The \"gilded cage\" metaphor, however, adds a layer of complexity, suggesting that while education promises freedom and opportunity, it can also trap individuals in debt.\n\nThis systematic approach, combined with my natural thought patterns, leads me to consider various tangents and connections. I think about how the concept of \"burden\" can be applied not just to the financial aspect but also to the emotional and psychological weight of debt. The idea of an \"education factory\" prompts me to consider the role of the education system in perpetuating debt and whether alternative models could reduce this burden. The metaphors also lead me to intuitive connections, such as the realization that just as a life raft is essential for survival in a stormy sea, debt forgiveness can be a crucial lifeline for those drowning in debt.\n\nThrough this process, insights begin to emerge from both the structured approach and my natural intuition. Applying the metaphorical thinking technique leads me to discover terms like \"financial anchor,\" \"education factory output,\" \"gilded shackles,\" \"economic lighthouse,\" and \"debt tsunami,\" which capture the essence of the issue in a way that traditional query terms might not. My instinct also tells me that we should consider not just the legal and financial aspects but also the human stories and emotional landscapes of those affected by student loan debt.\n\nAs I synthesize my findings, I believe that the expanded query terms, such as \"impact student loan debt career opportunities,\" \"bankruptcy tool student loan relief,\" \"student loan debt burden economic mobility,\" and \"exploring alternative education models reduce debt,\" offer a more comprehensive approach to understanding the query. These terms emerge logically from both the systematic application of the metaphorical thinking technique and my natural thought patterns, ensuring that the final query expansion is both structured and intuitively insightful.\n\nBy combining the systematic steps of metaphorical thinking with the natural flow of my thoughts, reconsiderations, and intuitive leaps, I've developed an expanded query that not only captures the complexity of the original question but also offers a nuanced and multifaceted exploration of the issue. This approach demonstrates how an expert's thought process can balance structured techniques with natural cognitive patterns to produce a rich and insightful query expansion.",
