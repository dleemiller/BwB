  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: Many people disagree over the topic of Should People Become Vegetarian as it is controversial issue. My opinion on the issue of Should People Become Vegetarian is that people do not have to become vegetarian. This claim is justified by the fact that raising beef is one of the most efficient way to produce food and access to get protein for humans. This is a good thing, because with the rapidly increasing population, we need as much food as we can provide that also provides us with the nutrition we need. Inevitably, we must agree that not everyone should be vegetarian, because we need to provide everyone food and this is one of the most efficient way.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: Many people disagree over the topic of vegetarianism, as it is a very controversial topic. There is little doubt that all people should become vegetarian. This claim is justified by the fact that vegetarianism is much better for the environment. According to procon.org, producing one hamburger clears 55 square feet of rainforest. Every year, the U.S. imports thousands of tons of Brazilian beef, most of which was raised on rainforest-cleared land. This is a disaster. As intelligent beings, it is ridiculous that we are clearing rich, biologically diverse lands in order to create more flat, dead land for beef production. Our rainforests are precious and dwindling, and eating should not mean consuming meat abundantly, without thought for the consequences. We have moved on to the age where we are conscious of our effects in the world, the age where our desires aren\"t above the needs of our planet. Vegetarianism is a choice that reflects that.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: I don't think everyone should HAVE to become one; everyone should have say in what they eat or not. 5 Reasons Why They Shouldn't: 1. Humans have been eating meat for millions of years and it is an essential part of our evolution. 2. Vegetarian diets can cause the death of animals (such as birds, mice, and rabbits) that live in agricultural crop fields are killed during harvest. 3. Meat is the most convenient source of protein. 4. Research has shown that many plants feel fear. 5. A meat-centred diet can help with weight loss. It takes fewer calories to get protein from lean meat than it does from vegetarian options.\n",
  "thought_process": "As I delve into the query \"Should people become vegetarian?\", my initial impression is that this is a complex and multifaceted issue. It's not just about the personal choice of diet, but also about the environmental, health, and ethical implications of such a decision. The user might be seeking a straightforward answer, but the reality is that there are various perspectives and factors to consider. I think of the debate surrounding vegetarianism, with some arguing that it's essential for the planet's well-being, while others claim that it's not a feasible or necessary choice for everyone.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the existing reasoning lacks objective, factual information and relies heavily on debate arguments from online platforms. This tells me that the user needs a more balanced and informative response that addresses the query from various angles. The strengths of the search terms lie in their ability to spark discussion and raise important questions, but the weaknesses lie in their lack of depth and nuance.\n\nTo approach this query in a structured manner, I'll employ the \"Query Expansion Through Journalistic Investigation\" technique. This involves treating the query as a story that needs to be researched and developed, identifying real-world contexts, and seeking out authoritative sources of information. By doing so, I aim to uncover legitimate, real-world terms that would appear in high-quality content about this topic.\n\nAs I apply the technique, I start by assessing the query and identifying the underlying information needs. The user wants to understand the benefits and drawbacks of vegetarianism, evaluate the environmental impact of meat consumption, assess the health effects of a vegetarian diet, consider animal welfare and ethical implications, and explore cultural and social aspects of vegetarianism. These query goals will guide my investigation and help me stay focused on the most relevant aspects of the topic.\n\nNext, I identify diverse real-world scenarios where this query is relevant, such as professional contexts, educational settings, personal situations, and specialized communities. This helps me consider the various perspectives and experiences that might shape the user's understanding of vegetarianism. I also investigate authoritative sources of information, including notable experts, established methodologies, and essential terminology.\n\nAs I create headlines that could introduce articles addressing the query from multiple angles, I begin to extract specific terms that represent precise concepts related to the query. These terms include \"plant-based diet\", \"sustainability\", \"greenhouse gas emissions\", \"animal welfare\", and \"cultural norms\". I notice that some of these terms are interconnected, and exploring their relationships could provide valuable insights.\n\nHowever, I also experience some false starts and reconsiderations. For instance, I initially think that the query is solely about the environmental benefits of vegetarianism, but as I delve deeper, I realize that the health effects and ethical implications are equally important. I adjust my approach to ensure that I'm considering all aspects of the query.\n\nThroughout this process, I'm aware of the importance of balancing structured steps with natural thought patterns. I allow myself to make intuitive connections and explore tangents that might seem unrelated at first but could ultimately yield unexpected insights. For example, I consider the cultural and social factors that influence food choices and how they might impact the user's decision to become vegetarian.\n\nAs I synthesize my findings, I realize that the augmented query should capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of the user's information needs. The final terms should emerge logically from both the technique and natural insights, providing a comprehensive and nuanced response to the query.\n\nThrough this process of applying the \"Query Expansion Through Journalistic Investigation\" technique and exploring related threads, I believe that the terms \"plant-based diet\", \"sustainability\", \"greenhouse gas emissions\", \"animal welfare\", and \"cultural norms\" would be most effective for a BM25 index. They capture the complexity and multifaceted nature of the query, providing a balanced and informative response that addresses the user's needs from various angles.",
