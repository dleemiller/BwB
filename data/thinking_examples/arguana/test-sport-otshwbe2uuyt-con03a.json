  "query": "The boycott would affect Poland and the Ukrainian people as well as Yanukovych  A boycott of Euro 2012 even if it was meant to be limited to Ukraine would negatively impact on the whole tournament. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tust argued \"It is in Poland's undisputed interest to hold the games in Poland and Ukraine without a hitch and to prevent politics from ruining the great effort\", [1] any boycott would unnecessarily move the attention away from the games itself towards politics.  It should also be remembered that Viktor Yanukovych does not represent the whole of Ukraine and only won by a narrow margin with 48.95% of the vote compared to Yulia Timoshenko\u2019s 45.47% in the second round. [2] Arseniy Yatsenyuk leader of the Front for Change has urged leaders not to boycott \"The best scenario would be if the European leaders attended the championship, but did not meet President Yanukovych. It's supposed to be a visit to Ukrainians, not to Yanukovych\". [3] This would show that European countries support the Ukrainian people and their democratic aspirations and even hope they may be eventually will join the European Union while showing displeasure at Yanukovych\u2019s policies and lack of support for democracy.

  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: A boycott won\u2019t help resolve the issues at question  European leaders need to consider whether their methods are likely to achieve the result they want. What Europe\u2019s leaders want is first of all Yulia Timoshenko released and secondly improvements in Ukrainian human rights. Timoshenko is unlikely to be released as she has been convicted on charges of abuse of office and sentenced to seven years in prison; the best that could be hoped for is an improvement in her treatment. Similarly the result is not likely to be positive for human rights and democracy. There might be an improvement during the games while the eyes of the world are on Ukraine but long term there will be no impact unless Yanukovych is persuaded that improvements are in his benefit. This would require more concrete and long term actions than one off boycotts.  Past boycotts have demonstrated a lack of success in changing the situation on the ground. In the 1980 Olympics held in Moscow during the Cold War the USA boycotted in response to the 1979 invasion by the USSR of Afghanistan. The result was that the Soviet Union stayed in Afghanistan, won most medals in the Olympics and retaliated by boycotting the 1984 games held in Los Angeles. [1]  [1] Gera, Vanessa, \u2018Boycott of Ukraine During Euro 2012 Carries Risk\u2019, Associated Press, 11 May 2012.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: Boycotting Euro 2012 is proportional  Diplomacy is necessary with any regime almost no matter how oppressive they are however that does not show approval of a regime to the world in the way that high profile visits and events can. Just as the Beijing Olympics were the People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s coming out party so Euro 2012 is an ideal chance for Ukraine to show itself off to Europe and the rest of the world. If there was not a boycott this would implicitly show that Europe approves of Ukraine and the actions of its government.  In a list of possible diplomatic responses that range from verbal diplomatic complaints right up to sanctions a boycott represents a mid-point. A boycott is perhaps the best action that the European Union leaders could take is it takes away the shine that the event would otherwise give the Yanukovych. It will be denying him the political benefits of the Euros while highlighting rights concerns. A boycott is also proportional because it gives Ukraine\u2019s leaders a chance to reform before beginning any further measures that would have a much deeper effect on diplomatic relations.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: There is little evidence that Yanukovych still has much support anywhere in Ukraine. However an ICC trial could simply inflame the other side; those who have overthrown Yanukovych are likely to want a trial to take place as soon as possible (which may be a long time off considering he is in Russia) and want it to take place in the Ukraine. The ICC would almost certainly be willing to give in to popular opinion; previously in Libya the prosecutor did not act when it was clear that public opinion did not want an international trial of Saif Gadaffi.

  "thought_process": "Looking at the query about the boycott of Euro 2012 and its impact on Ukraine and Poland, this makes me think of the complex political landscape of Eastern Europe and the delicate balance of international relations. The user might be trying to understand the potential consequences of such a boycott, not just on the political front but also on the people of Ukraine and the economic aspects of the tournament. Hmm, not sure yet how deep they want to dive into the specifics of Ukrainian politics versus the broader implications for European relations.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I see that there are strengths in how the current search terms highlight the political tension and the potential for the boycott to affect not just Ukraine but also Poland, given their joint hosting of the tournament. However, a weakness is that the search might not fully capture the nuances of public opinion in both countries or the historical context of similar boycotts and their effectiveness.\n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here... Let me approach this using the Conceptual Territory Mapping technique, which involves mapping out the central points, boundary areas, landmarks, and detailed features of the query's conceptual territory. This should help because it allows for a systematic exploration of the topic while also leaving room for intuitive connections and insights that might arise from the mapping process.\n\nFollowing the Conceptual Territory Mapping approach, I should first identify the central point of the query, which seems to be the impact of the Euro 2012 boycott on Ukraine and Poland. The cardinal directions could include political, social, and economic dimensions. Setting the scale to medium-grained will help focus on key players, arguments, and potential consequences without getting too bogged down in minutiae.\n\nNow, exploring the boundaries, I note that the query touches on Ukrainian politics, Polish public opinion, international diplomacy, and economic consequences. These are crucial areas to map out, as they each have their own landmarks and detailed features. For instance, under Ukrainian politics, key landmarks would include Viktor Yanukovych, Yulia Timoshenko, and the Front for Change, while detailed features might include the allegations of electoral fraud and concerns over democracy and human rights.\n\nWait, that's not quite right for this query. Let me adjust my approach to better fit the task at hand. I need to consider not just the political entities but also the social and economic aspects that could be influenced by the boycott. This step of the technique is revealing the complexity of the situation, which actually reminds me of the Beijing Olympics boycott and its aftermath. The historical context of similar boycotts and their lack of success in achieving long-term change is an important aspect to consider.\n\nApplying the Conceptual Territory Mapping technique leads me to discover terms like \"boycott,\" \"Euro 2012,\" \"Ukraine,\" \"Poland,\" \"Yanukovych,\" and \"democracy\" as central to the query. However, my instinct says we should also consider terms related to the economic impact, international relations, and public opinion, as these could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the potential consequences of the boycott.\n\nI just had a realization that connects to what we were exploring earlier - the importance of considering the potential long-term effects of a boycott on Ukraine's relationship with the European Union and the impact on Ukrainian people's aspirations for democracy. This realization complements the systematic approach of the technique by adding a layer of depth that comes from understanding the human and political nuances involved.\n\nThrough this process of applying Conceptual Territory Mapping and exploring related threads, I believe the terms that would be most effective for further inquiry are those that capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of the user's query. These include not just the obvious terms like \"boycott\" and \"Euro 2012\" but also terms that reflect the political climate, economic concerns, and social dimensions of the situation.",
