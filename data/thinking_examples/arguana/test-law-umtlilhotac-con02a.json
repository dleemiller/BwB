The best show of commitment to open justice is to allow everyone to watch it, the best method of doing so is for the trial to be televised. This is all the more the case when the victims can't all be in court, either because of the numbers or because of the distance.  Television coverage will help bring the trial closer to the victims.

While televising trials will engage the victims and their families, televising a criminal trial may inflame tensions as well. During the trial of Saddam Hussein, Hussein made a number of calls to violence during his televised trial. Many of those who are on trial have a significant number of followers (see the widespread support for Uhuru Kenyatta) \u2013 television broadcasts would give them a means of communication\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: While recidivism is obviously a problem, this motion fails to take into account any situation where an individual has previously committed a crime but is innocent of the crime going to trial. Given that conviction rates soar when previous convictions are disclosed [1] , this motion doesn\u2019t rebalance the justice system to cater for the victims, but risks seriously prejudicing those who are innocent of the crime going to trial. A wrongful conviction is just as bad as a wrongful acquittal; the prejudicial effects on the jury\u2019s ability to make a verdict [2] undermines the objectivity of the justice system, and seriously risks the possibility of a fair trial.

  "thought_process": "As I delve into the query \"Open justice \u2013 crimes with large numbers of victims,\" my initial impression is that this topic revolves around the principle of open justice, particularly in the context of crimes that affect a significant number of people. The query hints at the importance of televising trials to ensure transparency and accessibility for victims who cannot be physically present due to the sheer number of victims or geographical constraints. My first association is with the legal frameworks that support open justice, such as the 6th Amendment to the US Constitution and Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which enshrine the right to a public trial.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the top documents discuss the benefits and challenges of televising criminal trials. For instance, the first text snippet emphasizes the potential for televising trials to bring closure to victims by allowing them to witness proceedings remotely. However, the second snippet introduces a cautionary note, highlighting the risk that televised trials could inflame tensions, especially when defendants have a significant following. This dichotomy suggests that the query needs to be expanded to capture both the supportive and critical perspectives on open justice and televised trials.\n\nTransitioning to a structured approach, I decide to apply the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal technique. This involves constructing a conceptual graph with core nodes representing the main entities and concepts from the query, such as \"Open Justice,\" \"Criminal Trials,\" and \"Victims.\" The first-order connections will include properties and relationships like \"televising trials\" and \"victim access,\" while second-order connections might involve related concepts such as \"judicial transparency\" and \"media coverage of trials.\"\n\nAs I traverse the conceptual graph, I identify several promising expansion paths. One path involves synonymous terms, such as \"public trials\" and \"transparent justice,\" which convey the same meaning as \"open justice.\" Another path explores hierarchical terms, including broader concepts like \"criminal justice\" and narrower terms such as \"trial proceedings.\" Compositional terms, such as \"victim support mechanisms\" and \"broadcasting ethics,\" offer additional avenues for expansion. Lastly, considering contextual terms like \"international criminal law\" and \"human rights\" can provide a richer understanding of the query's implications.\n\nThrough this systematic application of the technique, interspersed with natural cognitive elements, I begin to see insights emerge. For instance, the concept of \"victim support\" leads me to consider the psychological impact of televised trials on victims and their families, which might not have been immediately apparent. Similarly, exploring \"broadcasting ethics\" raises questions about the balance between transparency and the potential for manipulation or sensationalism in media coverage of trials.\n\nOccasionally, I find myself taking false starts or reconsidering certain paths. For example, initially, I thought emphasizing \"public access\" would be sufficient, but upon further reflection, I realize that \"victim-centered justice\" might be a more nuanced and relevant expansion term. These moments of reassessment are crucial, as they allow me to refine my approach and ensure that the expanded query accurately captures the complexities of the original search intent.\n\nAs I synthesize the insights from both the structured technique and my intuitive connections, I start to formulate the expanded query. Terms such as \"open justice principles,\" \"televised criminal trials,\" \"crimes with many victims,\" \"legal frameworks,\" \"victim support,\" \"transparency,\" \"accessibility,\" \"resource allocation,\" and \"international law\" emerge as key components. These terms not only reflect the core concepts of the original query but also incorporate the nuances and complexities uncovered through the expansion process.\n\nThrough this process of applying the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal technique and exploring related threads, I believe the terms identified would be most effective for enhancing the search query. They capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, balancing the need for transparency and accessibility in criminal trials with the complexities and challenges inherent in implementing open justice principles.",
