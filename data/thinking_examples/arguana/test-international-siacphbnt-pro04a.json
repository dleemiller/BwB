  "query": "Changing education systems and democracy.  Technology has enabled access to e-books and resources for students and teachers [1] . Such changes have enabled improved efficiency in teaching, with the availability of up-to-date resources and awareness of relevant theories. Furthermore, the ease by which students are able to access multiple resources and buy books online is expanding their intellectual curiosity and library.  In addition to raising new students, technology can be seen as a tool for democracy. Technology provides a tool for government accountability, transparency in information, and for good governance. Organisations, such as Ushahidi (Crowdmapping) following Kenya\u2019s 2007 post-election violence; and mySociety which updates citizens on parliamentary proceedings in South Africa, show how technology is feeding democratisation for youths [2] .

Measures are being implemented to ensure cyber-security and further technology is creating new, local, initiatives for security on the ground. Ushahidi Crowdmapping - an interactive, collective, mapping tool - was used to expose, and remember, political violence that occurred in Kenya\u2019s 2007 presidential election [1] .  [1] See further readings: Ushahidi, 2013.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: The technological revolution across Africa is broad, ranging from mobile technology to internet connectivity. The availability of mobiles has broadened who can use technology - being more inclusive to multiple socio-economic groups.  Internet.org [1] has been established to resolve issues, making connectivity affordable. The initiative, which involves a collaborative partnership between Facebook and technological organisations, has a vision of ensuring access to the internet for the two-thirds who remain unconnected. Connectivity is a fundamental necessity to living in our \u2018knowledge economy\u2019. Their mission has centred on three aspects: affordability, improving efficiency, and innovative partnerships to expand the number of people connected. Intervention has therefore focused on removing barriers to accessing information by connecting people.  Furthermore in Kenya, mobile phones have been made accessible to a wider audience through the removal of the general sales tax in 2009.  [1] See further readings: Internet.org, 2013.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: The importance of jobs in livelihoods - money  Jobs are empowerment. Building sustainable livelihoods, and tackling poverty in the long term, requires enabling access to capital assets. A key asset is financial capital. Jobs, and employment, provide a means to access and build financial capital required, whether through loans or wages. When a woman is able to work she is therefore able to take control of her own life. Additionally she may provide a second wage meaning the burden of poverty on households is cumulatively reduced. Having a job and the financial security it brings means that other benefits can be realised such as investing in good healthcare and education. [1] .  Women working from home in Kenya, designing jewellery, shows the link between employment and earning an income [2] . The women have been empowered to improve their way of life.

  "thought_process": "As I delve into the query \"Changing education systems and democracy\" and its intersection with technology, my initial impressions are that this is a multifaceted topic that spans historical, social, and technological dimensions. The user might be trying to understand how technology has influenced education and democracy over time, and what the future holds for these intertwined concepts. I notice that the original query highlights technology's positive impact on Africa, but the documents provided seem to touch on various aspects of technology, education, and democracy without directly addressing the core themes.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I see strengths in the way technology has been leveraged to enhance access to educational resources and promote democratic participation. However, there are weaknesses in how the current search terms might not fully capture the historical evolution and future trends of these concepts. For instance, the documents mention specific technologies like Ushahidi Crowdmapping and Internet.org, but they don't provide a comprehensive view of how technology has shaped education and democracy throughout history.\n\nTo approach this systematically, I decide to apply the \"Query Expansion via Temporal Evolution Analysis\" technique. This involves tracing the historical foundation of the topic, identifying key developmental milestones, assessing the current landscape, projecting emerging trends, and extracting temporally diverse terminology. By doing so, I aim to uncover a richer set of terms that can effectively capture the nuances of how technology has impacted education systems and democratic participation across different eras.\n\nStarting with the historical foundation, I consider how ancient civilizations like Greece valued literacy and philosophy, laying the groundwork for future educational systems. The medieval era saw the emergence of scriptoria and the printing press, which revolutionized knowledge dissemination. The Enlightenment period brought about public discourse and mass media, further influencing education and democracy. The Industrial Revolution introduced factories and education reform, setting the stage for modern educational systems.\n\nAs I move through the developmental milestones, I note the rise of computer-assisted learning, online education platforms, social media for citizen engagement, and global access to information through the web. These advancements have not only transformed education but also enabled new forms of democratic participation. The current landscape is characterized by personalized learning, MOOCs, educational technology, digital literacy, e-government, online activism, data-driven governance, and crowdfunding for social causes.\n\nLooking towards emerging trends, I see the potential of artificial intelligence in education, blockchain for transparency, virtual and augmented reality learning, decentralized learning platforms, citizen journalism, and fact-checking technologies. These innovations could significantly impact how we learn and engage in democratic processes in the future.\n\nThrough this structured approach, I begin to see a timeline of the topic's evolution unfold. I extract terms from each time period, identifying those that have remained relevant and those that provide historical context or future relevance. The augmented query starts to take shape, incorporating terms like \"impact of technology on education systems and democratic participation throughout history\" and \"evolution of educational technologies and their influence on civic engagement.\"\n\nAs I synthesize my findings, I realize that the final expanded query terms emerge logically from both the structured technique and natural insights. The terms capture the temporal spectrum of the topic, from ancient civilizations to future trends, and provide a comprehensive framework for understanding how technology has shaped education and democracy.\n\nBy applying the temporal evolution analysis technique and balancing it with natural thought patterns, I've been able to generate a nuanced and effective expanded query. This process has not only helped me understand the complex relationships between technology, education, and democracy but also demonstrated how structured approaches can be enhanced by intuitive connections and creative insights.",
