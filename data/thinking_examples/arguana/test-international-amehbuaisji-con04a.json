For example, there are no jury trials at the ICC \u2013 a majority vote of the judges is enough to convict - is a violation of the Sixth Amendment to the US Constitution.

There is, in addition, a lack of rules against double jeopardy, and the glacial rate of progress made by the ICC with lengthy waits in pre-trial detention for defendants, affecting the right to a speedy trial. It has also been argued that the procedures for special measures to protect witnesses hamper the defence.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: While the ICC operates its own rules of procedure and uses its own formulation for due process rights, it has protections as strong as the top legal systems around the world.  While the ICC is unique, it meets the standards accepted for a fair trial. For example, article 66(2) of the Rome Statute guarantees the presumption of innocence, article 54(1) covers disclosure, article 67 includes the right to counsel and a speedy trial. These safeguards are considered more than adequate by human rights campaign groups such as Amnesty International.  While the ICC does not use juries, in many cases it would be difficult to find an impartial jury or to transport them, and they would be unlikely to cope with the weighty and complex legal issues that occur in complex international criminal trials. At any rate, many states, even common law ones such as the US, do not use juries at all (such as Israel), and in some circumstances they can be allowed in the US.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n... Thus trial by jury is essential to ensuring that innocent individuals are fairly treated, and is a fundamental right which ought never be denied. As Chairman of the Criminal Bar Association Paul Mendelle QC said, \"Some principles of justice are beyond price. Trial by your peers is one of them.\"3  1.Robert P.

  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"ICC trials violate the due process guarantees of the US constitution,\" this makes me think of the potential implications of the International Criminal Court's (ICC) procedures on the rights of individuals, particularly Americans, under the US Constitution. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the legal basis for these concerns, it seems there's an underlying worry about the compatibility of ICC trials with US standards of due process. \n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the top documents highlight the debate around ICC trials, the lack of jury trials, and concerns about judicial independence and the protection of defendant rights. The strengths of these search terms lie in their direct relevance to the query, but their weaknesses include the potential for a narrow focus that might overlook broader contextual issues or comparative legal analyses.\n\nTo expand this query effectively, I'll transition to a structured approach using the Conceptual Graph Traversal technique. This technique involves constructing a conceptual graph of the query's core concepts, their relationships, and then traversing this graph to identify relevant expansion terms. The rationale behind choosing this technique is its ability to visually map out semantic relationships between concepts, which can help in identifying both synonymous and hierarchically related terms that might enhance the query's retrieval effectiveness.\n\nStarting with the core concepts identified in the query\u2014ICC trials, US Constitution, due process, jury trial, judicial independence, and double jeopardy\u2014I'll construct the graph. The first-order connections include the relationships between these concepts, such as how ICC trials relate to the US Constitution, particularly through the lens of due process violations. Second-order connections involve broader legal concepts, international law principles, and comparative legal systems analysis. Domain contexts include international criminal law, human rights, and constitutional law.\n\nFor expansion path selection, I'll focus on hierarchical terms (broader/narrower concepts), compositional terms (parts of the ICC process), and contextual terms (settings where ICC trials are discussed, like human rights forums). I'm looking for terms that maintain the original search intent while offering new pathways for document retrieval.\n\nUpon traversing the conceptual graph, terms that emerge as high-value expansions include \"international criminal law,\" \"human rights protections,\" \"comparative judicial systems,\" \"Rome Statute provisions,\" and \"fair trial standards.\" These terms capture both the explicit concerns about ICC trials and the implicit desire to understand the legal and procedural contexts in which these trials operate.\n\nOne insight from applying the Conceptual Graph Traversal technique is the realization that the debate around ICC trials is not isolated but part of a larger discussion on international justice, human rights, and the role of judicial systems in protecting individual rights. This broadens the query's scope, allowing for the inclusion of documents that might not directly mention \"ICC trials\" but are highly relevant to the underlying legal and procedural issues.\n\nAs I synthesize the insights from both the structured technique and my natural thought patterns, I believe the terms that would be most effective for expanding the query are those that balance specificity with breadth of coverage. For instance, incorporating terms related to \"judicial independence,\" \"fair trial rights,\" and \"international human rights law\" could enhance the query's ability to retrieve relevant documents without straying from the user's original intent.\n\nThrough this process of applying Conceptual Graph Traversal and exploring related threads, I conclude that the expanded query should indeed include terms like \"icc trials,\" \"us constitution,\" \"due process violations,\" \"jury trial rights,\" \"judicial independence,\" \"double jeopardy,\" \"speedy trial,\" \"witness protection procedures,\" alongside the newly identified terms such as \"international criminal law,\" \"human rights protections,\" and \"comparative judicial systems.\" These terms capture the essence of the user's concern while opening up the search to include a richer set of relevant documents and perspectives.",
