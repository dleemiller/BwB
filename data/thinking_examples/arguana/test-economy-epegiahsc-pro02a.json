  "query": "Multilateralism is preferable to bilateralism.  It is preferable for Latin American countries to band together when negotiating trade deals with the US and Canada, to better protect their interests. After FTAA negotiations failed, the US focused on bilateral strategies and trade deals where the imbalance of power was much greater in favour of the US, and it therefore could more easily dictate terms of the agreement that were detrimental to the interests of the developing country. For example, El Salvador, who is a member of CAFTA (Central America Free Trade Agreement), together with only five other Central American countries, has found itself under legal attacks by foreign investors when it refused to lower its environmental standards in the gold mining industry [1] . Having an emerging global power, like Brazil, be part of the agreement, would counterbalance US influence over the terms.

  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: FTAA is bad for labour in developed countries.  Liberalizing the labour market across the entirety of the Americas would be a severe blow to workers in the US and Canada. It would put them in direct competition with workers from countries where the average salary is much lower than in the US, who would be willing to work for a fraction of what a US or Canadian worker currently makes. In order to stay competitive in such a market, they would have to accept lower salaries and a cut in benefits. This would reverse decades of progress in the direction of better protections for workers and workers\u2019 rights, as well as lead to higher unemployment levels in developed countries [1] . This has occurred as a result of previous free trade agreements in the Americas for example the North American Free Trade Area (NAFTA) after it was implemented resulted in the displacement of 682,000 US jobs [2] this then gives employers a chance to reduce working conditions as there is surplus labor.  [1] Suroweicki, James. \u201cThe Free-Trade Paradox.\u201d The New Yorker. 26 May 2008.   [2] Scott, Robert E., \u201cHeading South: U.S.-Mexico trade and job displacement after NAFTA\u201d, Economic Policy Institute, 3 May 2011,\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: Implementing true free trade is unfeasible because it is unreasonable  An increasing number of countries are looking to bilateral Free Trade Agreements that will help them specifically. They are not directly open to free trade with all countries. These FTAs are undermining the position of the World Trade Organization which is meant to push countries towards economic liberalization1. Countries have no reason to start trading freely with everyone, if they already have FTAs with the most beneficial trading partners. The Doha round seeks to reduce trade barriers in industry and agriculture has been going on for ten years, but there is still no agreement. Disputes are becoming more common when it comes to trade. In 2009, there was a dispute over the US putting tariffs on Chinese tires that has created tension in the trade relationship between those two countries2. Considering that the WTO countries have been debating the Doha round for ten years, it is unreasonable to think that countries are going to adopt free trade policies with the whole world. It is much more likely they will concede to bilateral free trade agreements that specifically help themselves. Since it is unlikely for free trade to become a universal policy it is not beneficial for all countries.  1 Meltzer, Joshua (2011), \"The Future of Trade\", Foreign Policy Magazine,  2 Bradsher, Keith (2009), \"China-US Trade Dispute Has Broad Implications\", .\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: It is a hyperbole to suggest that American-led globalization and the spread of free and open markets has been \u201cimposed\u201d on developing countries; globalisation has been a far more impersonal and voluntary process. Moreover, rather than being exploited, the spread of free trade and open markets has benefited developing countries; one only needs to see the success of China, and India after 1991 when it embraced neoliberal reforms to find evidence of this. More generally too, World Bank reports have suggested that poorer countries that are \u201cmore globalized\u201d have grown faster than even developed countries, while those that are \u201cless globalized\u201d have seen their GDPs drop.[34] The purportedly \u201chub and spoke\u201d system the US has employed has also benefited many countries, which have received security guarantees from America, and can often count on the US to help tackle regional threats and ensure stability. Middle Eastern states that cooperate with the US to tackle terrorism and a resurgent and nuclear Iran provide examples of this.

  "thought_process": "As I delve into the query \"Multilateralism is preferable to bilateralism\" in the context of Latin American countries negotiating trade deals with the US and Canada, my initial impression is that this topic is complex and multifaceted. It makes me think of the delicate balance of power in international trade negotiations and how different countries might approach these negotiations to protect their interests. The user might be trying to understand the advantages of multilateralism over bilateralism, but they might also be interested in the challenges and potential drawbacks of each approach.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the text snippets provide a range of perspectives on free trade agreements, from the potential negative impacts on labor markets in developed countries to the benefits of globalization for developing countries. The strengths of these search terms lie in their ability to capture the diversity of opinions and experiences related to trade agreements. However, a weakness is that they might not fully address the specific context of Latin American countries and their negotiations with the US and Canada.\n\nTo expand this query effectively, I will use the technique of user intent and journey mapping. This involves creating personas for different types of users, such as a novice student, an intermediate journalist, an advanced economist, and an expert trade negotiator, each with their own goals, motivations, and prior knowledge. By understanding how these personas would approach the topic at different stages of their information journey, I can identify a richer set of search vocabulary that reflects various intent terms and contextual scenarios.\n\nStarting with the novice user, I consider what basic questions they might have about multilateralism and bilateralism, such as \"What is multilateralism in trade?\" and \"How does it benefit Latin America?\" For the intermediate user, the questions might become more specific, such as \"Examples of successful multilateral trade agreements\" and \"Challenges to multilateralism in global trade.\" The advanced user might be looking for more nuanced analysis, including strategic negotiation tactics for regional blocs and the economic impact of bilateral vs. multilateral agreements. Finally, the expert user would likely be interested in the most specialized and detailed aspects of trade negotiations, including policy implications and negotiation tactics.\n\nAs I apply this technique, I systematically consider each step, from creating personas to analyzing search vocabulary and mapping the information journey. However, I also allow for natural cognitive elements to influence my thought process, such as occasional false starts or reconsiderations. For instance, I might initially think that a particular term is crucial for the novice user, only to realize later that it's more relevant to the advanced user. This back-and-forth process helps me refine my understanding of how different users approach the topic.\n\nThrough this process, insights begin to emerge from both the structured approach and my intuition. I realize that terms like \"trade deals,\" \"Latin America US Canada,\" and \"multilateralism bilateralism\" are foundational but might not capture the full complexity of the user's intent. Additional terms such as \"CAFTA,\" \"El Salvador environmental standards,\" and \"Brazil's role in regional blocs\" provide more specific context and could be crucial for users looking for detailed information on these topics.\n\nMoreover, I consider how the technique of user intent and journey mapping complements my natural thought patterns. The systematic application of this technique ensures that I cover all aspects of the user's journey, from basic awareness to expert analysis. At the same time, my intuition and experience allow me to make connections between different pieces of information and to identify potential gaps in the search vocabulary.\n\nAs I synthesize my findings, I conclude that the most effective expanded query would include terms that reflect both the explicit and implicit aspects of the user's search. This means incorporating not just the obvious keywords related to multilateralism and bilateralism but also terms that capture the nuances of the user's intent, such as \"benefits,\" \"impact,\" \"power dynamics,\" and \"strategies.\" The final expanded query, \"Multilateral trade agreements benefits for Latin America, US-Canada impact comparison, CAFTA environmental concerns, Brazil's role in regional blocs,\" emerges logically from both the structured technique and my natural thought process.",
