  "query": "Suicide is a selfish act that causes suffering to others  Suicide is an entirely selfish act that causes immense pain and suffering for those loved ones that are left behind. It is also cowardly; rather than facing your problems and being strong, you instead take the easy way out and kill yourself. It is important, therefore, to instil a strong sense of responsibility to one\u2019s family and for one\u2019s affairs and to do this by punishing those who try and fail to perpetrate this selfish and cowardly act.",

  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: This is only an objection to particular cases of suicide; it cannot be made into a general case because some suicides really do only affect the individual \u2013 those in which there is no extended family or friendship group. And that an act is, on occasion, selfish is not sufficient grounds to prohibit it. Indeed, ostracising one\u2019s friends or walking out on one\u2019s family can upset people but we are hardly likely to deny people the liberty to make such individual, private life choices. Nobody has the right to force people to live in circumstances that cause them unhappiness. Suicide should be viewed in exactly the same way.  Moreover it should be remembered that an attempt to prosecute survivors or in some way to punish relatives of those who succeed is clearly not going to help leaving grieving relatives in a worse position. [1]  [1] Holt, \u2018When Suicide was illegal\u2019, 2011\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: There is no comparison between the right to life and other rights. When you choose to remain silent, you may change your mind at a later date; when you choose to die, you have no such second chance. Arguments from pro-life groups suggest that nearly ninety-five percent of those who kill themselves have been shown to have a diagnosable psychiatric illness in the months preceding suicide. The majority suffer from depression that can be treated. [1] If they had been treated for depression as well as pain they may not have wanted to commit suicide. Participating in someone\u2019s death is also to participate in depriving them of all choices they might make in the future, and is therefore immoral.  [1] Herbert Hendin, M.D., Seduced by Death: Doctors, Patients, and Assisted Suicide (New York: W.W. Norton, 1998): 34-35.  (accessed 4/6/2011)\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: Reality is a lot murkier than theory. How are we to determine a state\u2019s intent? Sometimes good intentions are bound up with bad; public justifications for war may not always represent the real reasons. And who is determine if a peace is just or a wrong has been committed? The nation initiating the war will use its own values to justify its intentions, and these values may be at odds with those of the other party to the conflict. Furthermore, it is altogether possible to fight a war for selfish motives and nevertheless protect civilians and reduce suffering in so doing.\n",
  "thought_process": "As I delve into the original query, \"Suicide is a selfish act that causes suffering to others,\" I'm immediately struck by the strong negative emotions and judgmental tone. This makes me think of the complexities surrounding suicide and how it's often a result of deep-seated emotional pain, mental health issues, or unbearable circumstances. The user's perspective seems to lack empathy and understanding of the multifaceted factors contributing to suicidal thoughts. I wonder if they're trying to express a concern for the well-being of those left behind or if there's a deeper, personal connection to the topic.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the text snippets from documents at k=1, k=2, and k=10 provide a range of perspectives, from philosophical debates about the morality of suicide to discussions about mental health and the complexities of human decision-making. These results highlight the weaknesses of the original search terms, such as \"selfish\" and \"cowardly,\" which oversimplify the issue. I see that the terms \"mental health,\" \"depression,\" and \"support systems\" emerge as more relevant and nuanced.\n\nTo expand the query effectively, I'll employ the expansion technique, which involves introducing new dimensions to the query through targeted expansions. I'll start by identifying ineffective terms, such as \"selfish\" and \"cowardly,\" and replace them with more specific and diverse terms. The breadth expansion phase yields terms like \"mental health resources,\" \"therapy options,\" and \"crisis intervention,\" which seem promising. However, I need to dig deeper to uncover more relevant and targeted terms.\n\nAs I transition to the depth expansion phase, I focus on one distant but important topic, \"mental health resources,\" and explore related terms. I discover concepts like \"coping mechanisms for grief,\" \"support groups for suicidal ideation,\" and \"warning signs of suicide.\" These terms not only provide a more nuanced understanding of the topic but also offer a more empathetic approach. I notice that some of these terms, such as \"grief\" and \"support systems,\" have natural connections to the original query, while others, like \"crisis counseling,\" offer a more specialized perspective.\n\nThrough this process, I'm struck by the realization that the original query's negative tone and judgmental language may be a barrier to finding helpful resources and support. By shifting the focus from blame to understanding and empathy, we can uncover more relevant information and create a safer, more supportive environment for those struggling with suicidal thoughts. The technique has helped me systematically expand the query, but it's the natural cognitive elements \u2013 the occasional false starts, intuitive connections, and tangents \u2013 that have led to unexpected insights and a more comprehensive understanding of the topic.\n\nAs I synthesize the results, I believe that the augmented query, \"mental health resources therapy coping mechanisms grief support groups warning signs crisis counseling,\" captures the essence of what we're trying to achieve. These terms emerge logically from both the technique and natural insights, providing a more empathetic and nuanced approach to understanding suicide and supporting those affected by it. By balancing structured technique with natural cognitive patterns, I've generated a thought process that not only expands the query but also fosters a deeper understanding of the complexities surrounding this sensitive topic.",
