  "query": "An independent Scotland has enormous economic potential to join other small European nations, especially as a leader in technology and renewable energy  Many of Scotland\u2019s problems are grounded in the fact that its potential has consistently been held back. Because the focus for economic development from a Westminster perspective has focused for generations on North Sea oil and the coal fields of Lanarkshire, huge opportunities were missed and the best and the brightest tended be dragged down south for jobs worthy of their skills.  Even with the limited powers allowed by devolution a burgeoning life-sciences sector, a growing IT sector in silicon glen are adding to the traditional industries.

  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: Scotland has different interests to rUK  States are often seen as having one single unitary interest, however this is not the case the interests of different regions can be very different. It should therefore not be surprising that Scotland and rUK have different interests with relation to the EU. For example on climate change Scotland has the greatest potential for the generation of renewable energy in Europe with 25% of Europe\u2019s tidal potential and 10% of wave potential [1] yet the UK is in favour of scrapping European targets for the generation of renewable energy. [2] UK ministers have also been accused of \u201cworking against Scotland\u201d on agriculture being willing to accept reductions in farm support meaning that Scotland receives the lowest level in Europe. [3] Scotland\u2019s own interests would therefore be better represented by having its own government at the negotiating table than a UK government.

This is grounded in a tradition and history that is quite different from that south of the Border and includes legal and education systems that have always been separate.  That has manifested itself in a distinct policy agenda since devolution and areas such as free care for the elderly and the abolition of student tuition fees.  Despite the opinions of doomsayers before devolution it has been proved as a remarkable success and massive approval throughout the UK with 70% saying it has been a success. [i]  [i] The Scotsman. \u201c70% of Britons support devolution for Scotland, poll suggests\u201d 8 May 2009.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: There is a growing demand for mineral resources  Improving the lives of its citizens is one of the most important roles of the state. And in terms of improving lives economic growth is usually considered the most important economic goal. [1] And in order to grow cheap fuel is needed. Nuclear energy is still precarious, and expensive, and renewable technologies cannot come close to meeting the existing needs of the west, let alone those of Russia, China, Brazil, India and the rest.  We are confronted with a stark reality \u2013 either use new sources of oil and gas while investing in replacement technologies or see a collapse in standards of living and life expectancy around the world.  There is much to be said for less carbon-based economies but we don\u2019t have one yet. Until that option is available, the lights need to be kept on. The area north of the Arctic Circle is thought to contain as much as 160 billion barrels of oil, more than a quarter of the world's undiscovered reserves. [2]  There are costs to exploiting those reserves \u2013 some of them environmental \u2013 but they pale into insignificance compared with the collapse of the global economy that would result from the projected increases in global oil and gas costs.

  "thought_process": "As I delve into the query about Scotland's economic potential as an independent nation, I find myself drawn into a complex web of thoughts and associations. The original query sparks ideas about the country's vast renewable energy resources, its burgeoning life-sciences sector, and the historical context of its economic development. I think to myself, \"Looking at 'Scotland's economic potential'... this makes me think of other small European nations that have successfully navigated independence and thrived economically.\"\n\nMy initial impressions are that the query touches on several key areas, including the potential for Scotland to become a leader in technology and renewable energy. However, I also recognize that the search results may be biased towards arguments against independence, lack historical economic context, and overemphasize EU membership rather than specific industries. I consider how the user might actually be trying to understand the specific economic sectors and opportunities for an independent Scotland, and how they might be looking for a more nuanced exploration of the topic.\n\nTo address these weaknesses and enhance the query, I decide to apply a structured approach using the expansion technique provided. I start with goal elucidation, identifying the core objective of understanding Scotland's economic potential and the gaps in the current query. I recognize that the original query lacks specific terms related to Scottish industries, historical economic policies, and comparisons with other small European nations.\n\nAs I transition into the structured approach, I introduce the expansion technique, which involves a systematic process of term identification, breadth expansion, and depth expansion. I think to myself, \"Let me approach this using the expansion technique, which involves identifying ineffective terms, expanding the query to include new dimensions, and then focusing on a specific area for deeper exploration. This should help because it will allow me to systematically identify relevant terms and concepts that can enhance the query.\"\n\nI begin by identifying ineffective terms that are too broad or generic, such as \"enormous,\" \"potential,\" \"problems,\" and \"opportunities.\" I recognize that these terms may generate generic results and do not add much value to the query. Next, I move on to breadth expansion, where I introduce new search terms related to specific Scottish industries, historical economic policies, and comparisons with other small European nations. I consider terms like \"Scottish manufacturing,\" \"financial services sector,\" \"Nordic economic model,\" and \"energy transition policies.\"\n\nAs I apply the expansion technique, I find myself balancing structured steps with natural thought patterns. I have occasional false starts or reconsiderations, such as when I think about the potential impact of Brexit on Scotland's economy, but then realize that this is not directly relevant to the query. I also make intuitive connections, such as recognizing the importance of renewable energy in Scotland's economic future, and considering how this might be related to other industries, such as sustainable tourism.\n\nI then focus on depth expansion, where I choose a specific area, in this case, \"renewable energy,\" and explore related terms in more depth. I consider terms like \"offshore wind power Scotland,\" \"tidal energy resources,\" \"hydrogen economy Scotland,\" and \"renewable energy jobs Highlands.\" As I delve deeper into this area, I start to see insights emerging from both the structured approach and my natural thought patterns. I think to myself, \"Applying the expansion technique has led me to some interesting terms, such as 'hydrogen economy Scotland' and 'energy storage solutions Scotland.' These terms seem to capture the essence of Scotland's potential in renewable energy and could be useful in enhancing the query.\"\n\nThrough this process of applying the expansion technique and exploring related threads, I believe that the augmented query should include terms that capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking. I think that the final terms should emerge logically from both the technique and my natural insights, and should provide a more nuanced and comprehensive exploration of Scotland's economic potential.\n\nIn synthesizing my thoughts, I conclude that the augmented query should include a combination of terms related to Scottish industries, historical economic policies, and comparisons with other small European nations, as well as more specific terms related to renewable energy. I believe that this will provide a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of Scotland's economic potential and will help to address the weaknesses in the original query.",
