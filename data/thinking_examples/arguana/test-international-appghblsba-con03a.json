Lesotho is investing 12% of its GDP in education and 85% of its population over 15 is literate. [1] This can provide an knowledgeable, smart workforce for SA which can help develop both countries. On the other hand, South Africa is also dependent on one resource from Lesotho and this is water. Over the past 25 years, a mutual, bilateral agreement has been made between the two sovereign states so that the Lesotho Highlands Water Project can provide SA with clean water. [2] Moreover, the textile industry in Lesotho is competitive and profitable. The industry still contributes close to 20 percent of Lesotho's annual gross domestic product, and is its largest employer. [3] Lesotho would clearly not just be a burden.

  "thought_process": "As I delve into the query about South Africa annexing Lesotho, my initial impression is that this is a complex issue involving political, economic, and social considerations. The query itself highlights the potential burdens Lesotho might impose on South Africa, including economic hardship, instability, and the lack of resources. However, it also underscores South Africa's own internal issues, such as poverty and inequality, which might be exacerbated by such an annexation. This makes me think about the broader implications of annexation, not just for South Africa and Lesotho, but also for the region and potentially the global community.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the top-ranked documents emphasize the economic and social challenges that both countries face. There's a clear concern about the cost-benefit analysis of annexation, with some arguments suggesting that Lesotho could bring knowledgeable and smart workforce to South Africa, potentially benefiting both countries. However, other perspectives point out the dependency on Lesotho's water resources and the competitive textile industry, which could be both a boon and a burden. This dichotomy tells me that the issue is multifaceted and requires a nuanced approach.\n\nTo systematically approach this query expansion, I decide to use the conceptual graph traversal technique. This involves identifying core concepts and entities in the original query, determining the search intent, and listing any implicit assumptions or constraints. The core concepts here are \"South Africa,\" \"Lesotho,\" \"annexation,\" \"economic burden,\" \"poverty,\" \"inequality,\" and \"resources.\" The search intent appears to be informational, aiming to understand the implications of annexation. An implicit assumption might be that the economic and social welfare of both countries would be significantly impacted.\n\nConstructing a conceptual graph, I start with these core nodes and then expand to first-order connections, such as the economic dependencies between the two countries, the social implications of annexation, and the political context of regional integration. Second-order connections might include related concepts like development aid, economic dependency, and the role of international organizations. Domain contexts could involve fields like economics, political science, and international relations.\n\nFor expansion path selection, I identify several promising directions: synonymous terms for economic burden and poverty, hierarchical terms related to regional integration and international relations, compositional terms such as specific industries or resources, and contextual terms related to the historical and political context of South Africa and Lesotho. Domain-specific terminology could include concepts from development economics and political science.\n\nAs I traverse the conceptual graph and extract terms, I filter them based on relevance, distinctiveness, specificity, and searchability. This process involves some trial and error, reconsidering initial assumptions, and making intuitive connections between seemingly disparate concepts. For instance, the concept of \"water resources\" leads me to think about environmental sustainability and the potential for cooperative management of shared resources, which in turn suggests terms like \"transboundary water management\" and \"environmental cooperation.\"\n\nThrough this systematic yet flexible approach, I start to see insights emerge that complement the original query. Terms like \"economic integration,\" \"regional development,\" \"social cohesion,\" and \"political stability\" become apparent as crucial for understanding the annexation's implications. The technique helps to uncover these terms systematically, but it's the natural thought process\u2014considering tangents, making connections, and occasionally reconsidering initial paths\u2014that adds depth and nuance to the query expansion.\n\nUltimately, synthesizing these insights with clarity, I believe the expanded query should capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of the original query. This involves selecting terms that not only reflect the core concepts but also the broader contextual and domain-specific considerations. The final expanded query should thus include terms that encapsulate the economic, social, political, and environmental dimensions of the potential annexation of Lesotho by South Africa.",
