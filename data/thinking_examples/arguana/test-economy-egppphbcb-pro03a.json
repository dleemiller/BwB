People's class belonging, sexuality, sex, nationality, education etc. have a major impact on people's opportunities; there might be cases of individuals achieving the American dream like Barack Obama despite their social background, however this is not applicable to the majority of people. In capitalism the people with the most opportunities are usually the people who have the most capital, take the example of university students: universities in many countries such as the United States and United Kingdom charge students high tuition fees, if one is not wealthy enough to pay for these fees the likelihood to continue into further education is much lower (if a loan is provided one would have to risk to be indebted for a long period of one's life, or not have the opportunity to study at university at all)3. This can by no means be called an equal opportunity for everyone. It is not enough to provide opportunities; people must also be in a position to grab them.  1 Berger, P. L., &amp; Luckmann, T.

Athletes are very driven individuals, who would go to great lengths to achieve their goals. The chance of a gold medal in two years\u2019 time may out-weigh the risks of serious health problems for the rest of their life. We should protect athletes from themselves and not allow anyone to take performance-enhancing drugs. An example of the pressure is cycling. The American Scientific magazine explains: \u201cGame theory highlights why it is rational for professional cyclists to dope: the drugs are extremely effective as well as difficult or impossible to detect; the payoffs for success are high; and as more riders use them, a \u201cclean\u201d rider may become so noncompetitive that he or she risks being cut from the team.\u201d (1)  Michael Shermer, The Dopping Dillema, 03/31/2008,  accessed 05/15/2011\n",
  "thought_process": "As I begin to expand the query \"The capitalist society enhances personal freedom,\" my initial impressions are that this is a complex and multifaceted topic. The query seems to suggest that capitalism is inherently linked to individual freedom, but I'm not sure if that's entirely accurate. I think about how capitalism is often associated with the idea of personal freedom, but I also consider how social and economic factors can influence an individual's ability to exercise that freedom.\n\nLooking at the original query, I notice that it mentions the American Dream and how it represents the idea that everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed, regardless of their background. However, I also think about how this idea might be problematic, as it assumes that everyone has the same starting point and access to resources. I wonder if this is really the case, and if capitalism truly provides equal opportunities for all.\n\nAs I analyze the results of the original query, I notice that the top documents seem to present a positive view of capitalism and its relationship to individual freedom. However, as I delve deeper into the results, I see that there are also perspectives that challenge this notion. For example, the document at k=2 mentions how social circumstances, such as class and education, can impact an individual's opportunities. This makes me realize that the relationship between capitalism and individual freedom is more nuanced than I initially thought.\n\nI decide to approach this query using the Conceptual Territory Mapping technique, which involves creating a detailed map of the conceptual territory surrounding the topic. This technique seems particularly useful for this query, as it will allow me to visualize the different concepts and relationships involved.\n\nUsing this technique, I start by identifying the central coordinates of the query, which are capitalism and individual freedom. I then explore the boundary areas, including neighboring domains such as socialism, welfare states, and political ideologies. I also identify key landmarks, such as the American Dream, free markets, and social mobility.\n\nAs I map the conceptual territory, I start to notice some interesting patterns and connections. For example, I see how the concept of social mobility is closely tied to the idea of equal opportunities, and how this is influenced by factors such as education and access to resources. I also notice how the concept of free markets is often associated with the idea of individual freedom, but how this can also lead to economic inequality.\n\nThrough this process, I start to develop a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between capitalism and individual freedom. I realize that while capitalism can provide opportunities for individual freedom, it is also influenced by a complex array of social and economic factors. I start to see how the Conceptual Territory Mapping technique is helping me to uncover new insights and connections that I hadn't considered before.\n\nAs I continue to apply the technique, I start to identify some potential navigation terms that could be useful for expanding the query. These include terms such as \"economic opportunity,\" \"social mobility,\" \"government regulation,\" and \"market forces.\" I also consider how these terms relate to each other, and how they might be used to refine the query and retrieve more relevant results.\n\nThrough this process of applying the Conceptual Territory Mapping technique and exploring related threads, I believe that the most effective terms for expanding the query would be those that capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of the relationship between capitalism and individual freedom. These terms would include \"capitalism,\" \"individual freedom,\" \"social mobility,\" \"economic inequality,\" \"government regulation,\" and \"market forces.\" By using these terms, I hope to retrieve results that provide a more nuanced and comprehensive understanding of this complex topic.",
