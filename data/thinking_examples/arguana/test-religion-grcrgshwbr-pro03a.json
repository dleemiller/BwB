Religious symbols can be seen as possible tools for fuelling division within society. When some women wear the Hijab it creates pressure on other Muslim women to also cover their heads. Pressure comes both socially from wanting to look like other women in their community and religiously from imams and family leaders pressing for observance. As such, Muslims themselves are divided and religious oppression against women is internalized.1 Approving of Muslim head coverings in society cements the Hijab as an essential tenet of Islam, in the minds of non-Muslims as well as believers. However, many different schools of Islam exist and as on other issues, they often disagree how to interpret the Koran's dress prescriptions.

Banning the veil furthers the cause of moderate interpretations and prevents the entrenchment of severe interpretations.  1 Rumy Hassan, 'Banning the hijab', Workers Power 283 February 2004, accessed on 24th July 2011\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: Many symbols are seen as a symbol of oppression on women.  Religious symbols are seen to, in some cases, increase the equality divide between genders. As an example, the Muslim Hijab is considered by some as a very powerful symbol for the oppression of women, particularly in countries such as Saudi Arabia or Afghanistan where it is compulsory. Therefore, when it is worn in Western countries that encourage democracy and equality, the wearing of the Hijab is seen as almost counter-productive to the goals of democratic society. For this reason Belgium has recently banned the wearing of the full Muslim veil, much like France in 2010.1 Often Muslim dress rules for women are seen as more severe than those for men. Inequality between men and women is a form of discrimination and liberal societies should fight all forms of discrimination.  1 ' Belgian ban on full veils comes into force', BBC News Europe, 23rd July 2011, accessed on 23rd July 2011\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: Some argue that religious symbols, particularly those that are clearly seen, are not just for personal benefit. They affect the safety of the society around them. For example, there have been worries about how the Muslim full-veil may be used as a disguise for terrorists and how veils make it harder to ascertain someone's identity. Therefore, some symbols at least involve others, maybe even unintentionally, through the uneasiness and suspicion they cause.  1 'The Islamic Veil Across Europe', BBC News, 15th June 2010 , accessed on 25th July 2011\n",
  "thought_process": "As I begin to expand the search query, \"Religious symbols cause division within Western society,\" my initial impression is that this is a complex and multifaceted topic. The query itself makes me think of the various ways in which religious symbols can be perceived and interpreted by different individuals and groups within Western society. I consider how some people might view religious symbols as a source of unity and identity, while others might see them as a symbol of division and oppression.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the text snippets provided touch on the idea that religious symbols, such as the Hijab, can be seen as tools for fueling division within society. I also see that there are different interpretations of the Koran's dress prescriptions, with some schools of Islam accepting modest forms of modern dress and others requiring full covering with the Burka or similar veil. This makes me realize that the query needs to be expanded to capture the nuances of these different perspectives and interpretations.\n\nTo approach this expansion systematically, I decide to use the technique of query expansion via user intent and journey mapping. This involves creating user personas with varying expertise levels and identifying their search vocabulary, information needs, and intent terms throughout their journey from awareness to expertise.\n\nI start by creating four distinct user personas: a novice Muslim woman, an intermediate sociology student, an advanced legal scholar, and an expert imam. For each persona, I identify their initial search terms, follow-up searches, and how their vocabulary differs based on expertise. I also consider the contexts and situations that might prompt their search, such as problem-solving, learning, decision-making, or practical application.\n\nAs I map the progressive information needs of these users, I extract high-value terms across the expertise spectrum, contextual vocabulary from different usage scenarios, and intent-revealing terminology that clarifies search purpose. I notice that terms like \"hijab,\" \"cultural context,\" \"interpretation of dress codes,\" \"legal frameworks,\" and \"social cohesion\" are relevant across multiple personas and scenarios.\n\nHowever, I also realize that simply applying this technique mechanically might not capture the full complexity of the topic. I need to balance the structured approach with my natural thought patterns, allowing for occasional false starts, reconsiderations, and intuitive connections. For instance, I consider how the concept of \"religious freedom\" might intersect with \"social cohesion\" and how different legal frameworks might impact the interpretation of religious symbols.\n\nAs I apply the technique's steps systematically, I find that the initial search terms and follow-up searches identified for each persona are revealing insights into the diverse ways users might approach this topic. The novice Muslim woman might start with basic questions about the cultural significance of the Hijab, while the advanced legal scholar might explore legal precedents and constitutional rights regarding dress code.\n\nThe process of journey mapping and intent-based term extraction helps me to synthesize these insights and identify a set of expanded query terms that capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of the user's search intent. These terms include \"religious symbols,\" \"societal division,\" \"hijab,\" \"cultural context,\" \"interpretation of dress codes,\" \"legal frameworks,\" \"religious freedom,\" \"social cohesion,\" and \"Western societies.\"\n\nThrough this process of applying the query expansion technique and exploring related threads, I believe that these terms would be most effective for capturing the complexity of the original query and providing relevant results for users across different expertise levels and search intents.",
