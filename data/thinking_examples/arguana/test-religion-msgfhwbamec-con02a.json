  "reasoning": "The query revolves around the potential negative consequences (resentment, targeting, increased tensions, fueling extremism) arising from banning arranged marriages, particularly within Euro-Asian communities. The core argument is that such bans, presented as secular liberalism, can be perceived as intolerance and counterproductive to integration. The existing search results, while related, focus more on veil bans and general Islamophobia, lacking specific insights into arranged marriages. Therefore, I need to generate novel metaphors related to social pressure, cultural preservation, and the unintended consequences of interventions, that can broaden the search and find more specific information about arranged marriages and similar practices.",

The result will be that they won\u2019t co-operate with people of other faiths. This would be bad for society and make extremists more influential.

Arranged marriages encourage family over individualism, placing emphasis on a more considerate view of relationships that encourages development and patience rather than Hollywood romance. It is however not a rejection of western values to practice arranged marriages.  As pointed out by those who have written extensively on arranged marriages, [1] people in them often have a view of relationships that sees their spouse as a companion and source of support, but not as their only source of happiness. Learning to love a spouse as opposed to being with someone with whom there already exists a romantic interest can mean learning to value smaller gestures rather than having overblown expectations from a relationship.  The notion that all marriages have to be based on clich\u00e9d and unrealistic notions of love is delusional and deeply flawed. The fact that so few marriages measure up to the conventional Western ideal could help to explain why divorce rates are so high upon non-arranged marriages. In societies that claim to be plural and tolerant, contrasting views of marriage existing side-by-side should surely be encouraged.

  "thought_process": "As I delve into the query about arranged marriages and their potential ban, my initial impression is that this topic is steeped in cultural and social complexities. The original query highlights the risks of resentment, targeting, and increased tensions within Euro-Asian communities, particularly Muslim families, if such practices are outlawed. This makes me think of the broader context of social integration, cultural identity, and the delicate balance between preserving traditions and embracing secular liberalism. \n\nUpon analyzing the results of the original query, I notice that while they touch on related issues like veil bans and Islamophobia, they lack specific insights into arranged marriages. This gap suggests that the current search terms might not fully capture the nuances of the topic, indicating a need for query expansion. The existing reasoning provided emphasizes the potential negative consequences of banning arranged marriages, framed as a form of intolerance that could backfire and hinder integration efforts.\n\nMy approach to expanding this query will involve a structured technique, specifically leveraging metaphorical thinking to generate novel terms and perspectives. This technique, known as Query Expansion via Metaphorical Thinking, involves creating powerful metaphors for the query topic and then mining these metaphors for conceptually related terminology from diverse domains. The goal is to uncover fresh perspectives and terms that can broaden the search and yield more specific information about arranged marriages and similar practices.\n\nThe process begins with metaphor generation. I've developed five diverse metaphors for understanding arranged marriages: as a tightly woven cultural tapestry, a pressure cooker, a ship navigating cultural currents, an ancient tree, and a delicate ecosystem. Each metaphor is chosen from a varied domain (textiles, mechanics, navigation, nature, and biology) to offer complementary perspectives on the topic.\n\nNext, I map elements from the source domain of each metaphor to the target domain of arranged marriages. For instance, the tapestry metaphor maps threads to individual relationships, weaving to cultural traditions, and unraveling to the societal disruption caused by banning arranged marriages. Similarly, the pressure cooker metaphor equates social expectations with pressure, arranged marriage with a release valve, and social unrest with an explosion.\n\nThe metaphors are then extended to discover additional connections and insights. The tapestry, for example, can be seen as not just a static entity but a dynamic fabric that evolves over time, with each thread representing a unique relationship and the weaving process symbolizing the cultural narratives that bind these relationships together. The pressure cooker, when considered in the context of arranged marriages, highlights the potential for built-up social pressures to be released in unpredictable ways if such marriages are abruptly banned.\n\nThrough this process, I extract terminology inspired by each metaphorical domain. Terms like \"cultural fabric,\" \"social pressure,\" \"cultural currents,\" \"root system of tradition,\" \"social ecosystem,\" \"community stability,\" \"erosion of values,\" \"invasive policies,\" \"navigating traditions,\" and \"woven relationships\" offer valuable cross-domain insights. These terms are not only relevant to the topic of arranged marriages but also provide a framework for understanding the broader social and cultural implications of banning such practices.\n\nThe final step involves synthesizing these insights with clarity. By applying the Query Expansion via Metaphorical Thinking technique and exploring related threads, I believe the terms extracted from the metaphors would be most effective for capturing the complexities of arranged marriages and their potential ban. These terms\u2014such as \"arranged marriage,\" \"cultural fabric,\" \"social pressure,\" \"cultural currents,\" \"root system of tradition,\" \"social ecosystem,\" \"community stability,\" \"erosion of values,\" \"invasive policies,\" \"navigating traditions,\" \"woven relationships,\" \"Euro-Asian communities,\" \"unrest,\" \"intolerance,\" and \"extremism\"\u2014not only reflect the explicit concerns about banning arranged marriages but also implicitly address the need for a nuanced approach that respects cultural identities and promotes integration.\n\nThrough this thought process, it becomes evident that the issue of arranged marriages and their potential ban is multifaceted, requiring a careful consideration of cultural, social, and political factors. The use of metaphorical thinking as a query expansion technique has proven invaluable in uncovering novel perspectives and terms that can enhance our understanding of this complex topic.",
