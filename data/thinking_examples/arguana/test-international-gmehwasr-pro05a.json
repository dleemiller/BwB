  "query": "Diplomacy is not going anywhere  The best solution would be a ceasefire between the two sides in the Syrian civil war and a negotiated settlement, but it is clear we are long past the point where this approach stood a chance of success. The United Nations peace effort under Kofi Annan failed in the middle of last year [1] and there has been no progress since. Similarly all attempts to bring pressure to bear throughout the security council have failed as a result of Russia supporting Assad's regime. This leaves the unilateral initiatives to help the rebels. No state wants full intervention as France did in Mali [2] so the only alternative is simply to help the Free Syrian Army. To do so means providing what they need to win the conflict; primarily arms that can defeat the Syrian army. This need not be considered to be exclusive with diplomacy; the intervening state should continue to try to find a diplomatic solution just as before the Dayton accords NATO helped the Croats militarily while at the same time looking to diplomacy to provide an overall solution to the conflict.

  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: It is in the national interest for democracies to support those seeking to oust dictators  Democracies should support moderate groups seeking to oust dictators because the result will hopefully be a moderate, democratic state. This would then be a reliable partner for the future that would be more willing to help engage and resolve the region's problems. But this is not all about being high minded and wanting to promote democracy in the Middle East, arms need to be provided in order to ensure future influence in Syria. We already know that there are jihadis operating in Syria so it is plain that this is a conflict that will eventually have wider implications for the west. If we want to have influence in Syria after Assad is overthrown then we need to begin helping opposition groups. It is in our interest to build up the moderate groups so as to deny support to the extremists; once this is over we would be in a much better position if we have grateful friends on the ground rather than groups who are resentful that we provided fine words but no real help. We don't want to find ourselves having to root out terrorists from the air using UAVs. [1]  [1] Hokayem, Emile, in \u2018Roundtable: arming the Syrian rebels\u2019, Foreign Policy, 21 February 2013\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: Without the peace plan there will be further conflict.  Kofi Annan believes that peace can only be found together arguing all members of the Security Council \"Either unite to secure your common interests, or divide and surely fail in your own individual way. Without your unity\u2026 nobody can win and everyone will lose in some way.\" Moreover a failure of the peace plan would \u201cturn a humanitarian crisis into a catastrophe.\" [1] Without any prospect of a peaceful solution it is likely that Assad would escalate to using chemical weapons. Nawaf Fares, the Syrian Ambassador to Iraq who has defected, has warned that they would be used if the regime feels cornered. [2] If this were to happen Israel might be compelled to attack to prevent Syrian Chemical weapons being used against it or falling into the hands of terrorists. [3] This in turn would spark off a wider regional war.  [1] Beaumont, Peter, \u2018Failure of Syria peace plan \u2018risks wider regional conflict\u2019, guardian.co.uk, 30 June 2012.

There is certainly very little state practice (well not since 19th century imperialism anyway) where it has happened. [1] Even in the last decade there have been failures to intervene against states killing their own civilians in Chechnya, North Korea [2] and Uzbekistan. [3]  It is notable that this was very much scaled back from a more general doctrine of humanitarian intervention. This doctrine does not allow for any nation to take it upon itself to \u2018protect\u2019 another\u2019s civilians rather it provides an opportunity for the United Nations to do so. [4] \u201cThe international community, through the United Nations, also has the responsibility to use appropriate diplomatic, humanitarian and other peaceful means, in accordance with Chapters VI and VIII of the Charter\u201d this simply provided a mandate for the UN Security Council to intervene in such situations.

  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"Diplomacy is not going anywhere...,\" this makes me think of the complexities and challenges of international relations, especially in the context of the Syrian Civil War. The user seems to be exploring the idea that diplomacy may not be sufficient to resolve the conflict and that other approaches, such as providing arms to the Free Syrian Army, might be necessary. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the role of diplomacy versus intervention in such conflicts, it seems like they're leaning towards the idea that some form of intervention is inevitable.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the initial impressions and associations revolve around the themes of diplomacy, intervention, and the Syrian Civil War. The existing reasoning provided highlights the importance of understanding the historical context, key milestones, current state, and emerging trends related to armed intervention in the Syrian Civil War. This suggests that the user is interested in a comprehensive understanding of the topic, including its evolution over time and the various factors at play.\n\nTransitioning to a structured approach, I'll use the Query Expansion via Temporal Evolution Analysis technique. This involves analyzing how the query topic has evolved through time and will likely develop in the future to discover temporally diverse terminology. By applying this technique, I aim to identify terms that have remained relevant across different eras, as well as new terminology that is gaining acceptance.\n\nStarting with the historical foundation, I trace the origins and early development of the topic. I identify foundational concepts and terminology, such as ancient diplomacy, classical theories of war and peace, and the League of Nations. Moving on to the developmental milestones, I map key evolutionary stages in the topic's development, including the UN Charter, realpolitik, and humanitarian intervention in the 1990s.\n\nAs I analyze the current landscape, I assess the contemporary state of the topic, identifying current best practices and leading approaches. I note the terminology used by today's practitioners and experts, such as the Responsibility to Protect doctrine, civilian protection, and peacekeeping operations. Finally, I project how the topic is likely to evolve, identifying emerging trends, technologies, or approaches, such as multi-stakeholder interventions, cyberwarfare, and the role of artificial intelligence in conflict analysis.\n\nThrough this process, I compile terminology from each time period, identifying terms that have remained relevant across eras, such as diplomacy, intervention, and humanitarian crisis. I also select terms that provide historical context or future relevance, including Cold War legacy, NATO involvement, and international law.\n\nAs I reflect on the initial results, I notice that the text snippets from documents at various positions (k=1, k=2, k=10) provide valuable insights into the complexities of the topic. I see that the debate surrounding foreign intervention in Syria is multifaceted, involving considerations of national interest, humanitarian concerns, and international law. I also observe that the use of chemical weapons, the role of Israel, and the potential for a wider regional war are all critical factors in this discussion.\n\nInterspersing my structured analysis with natural thought patterns, I consider the potential consequences of different courses of action. I think about the implications of providing arms to the Free Syrian Army, the potential risks and benefits of intervention, and the importance of considering the long-term effects of such actions. I also recognize the need to balance competing interests and values, such as the desire to protect civilians versus the risk of escalating the conflict.\n\nAs insights emerge from both the structured technique and my natural thought patterns, I begin to see a clearer picture of the topic. I realize that the Syrian Civil War is a complex and dynamic issue, influenced by a range of historical, political, and social factors. I understand that any approach to resolving the conflict must take into account the evolving nature of the topic, including the emergence of new technologies, actors, and trends.\n\nThrough this process of applying the Query Expansion via Temporal Evolution Analysis technique and exploring related threads, I believe that the terms identified in the augmented query, such as \"Syrian Civil War intervention,\" \"Responsibility to Protect,\" and \"humanitarian crisis,\" are most effective for capturing the essence of the topic. These terms reflect both the explicit and implicit aspects of the user's query, providing a comprehensive understanding of the complexities involved.\n\nIn conclusion, my thought process has involved a combination of organic thinking and structured analysis, using the Query Expansion via Temporal Evolution Analysis technique to identify temporally diverse terminology. By balancing systematic application of the technique's steps with natural cognitive elements, I have aimed to provide a realistic and authentic representation of how an expert might think when expanding a search query.",
