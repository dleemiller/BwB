  "query": "Creates the perception that fines are like taxes, rather than a punishment  If we detach fines from the crimes committed, people are more likely to see fines as unrelated to justice. Rather, they will see fines as another mechanism by which the government makes money, this will be especially the case if as in New Zealand the money goes into government coffers without being hypothecated.1  This is similar to the way in which some people in the UK see speed cameras as less about preventing speeding, and more about getting money from motorists with one poll showing 49% of people believe they are primarily about revenue raising.2  This is harmful because it decreases the probability of people who deem the fine \u2018worth it\u2019 nevertheless abstaining from the criminal act.  1 \u2018Frequently Asked Questions\u2019, New Zealand Police,   2 \u2018Drivers conflicted over cameras\u2019, IAM Driving Road Safety, 11 August 2010,",

  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: Creates the perception that the rich are not immune to the consequences of their actions  Fines that are not proportionate to income may create the perception that the rich are immune to the consequences of their actions. This is because people see those earning the least struggling to pay a fine, whilst the rich are able to pay that fine easily, without making any significant sacrifices. Canada is an example of this being the case with two thirds of respondents on surveys saying that the Canadian justice system is unfair because it provides preferential treatment to the rich compared to how harsh it is towards the poor.1  Making fines proportionate to income would change that perception. People would then see the law being applied in such a way as to punish all, not just certain sections of society. ...\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: Only a small number of people will act like this. Some people, though rich, are nevertheless capable of seeing beyond self-interest, and will consider the fine to be fair.  This small harm is therefore easily outweighed by the improved perceptions of the justice system by those who currently believe it unfair that the rich can so easily buy their way out of trouble.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: Our fascination with discovery and exploration \u2013 especially anything to do with space \u2013 is one of the enduring aspects of the human condition. There are many areas of scientific development for which there is little popular support as people don\u2019t really see the point, however space exploration is one which retains support [i] .  Polling levels no are at broadly the same level they were in the 1960s, receiving support from about forty per cent of the electorate. However, it\u2019s worth noting that NASA has consistently higher public approvals than other federal agencies.

  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"Creates the perception that fines are like taxes, rather than a punishment,\" this makes me think of how people's perception of fines can significantly impact their effectiveness as a deterrent. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the psychological and ethical implications of fines, I'm not sure yet how deep they want to dive into the specifics of criminal behavior and justice systems. The query seems to touch on the idea that if fines are seen as merely a revenue source, they might lose their deterrent effect, which is an interesting point.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the top snippets discuss the perception of fines in relation to income proportionality and the rich being immune to consequences. This strengthens the idea that the query is not just about the financial aspect of fines but also about fairness and justice. However, the snippet from the document at k=10 seems somewhat unrelated, talking about space exploration and public support for NASA, which makes me wonder if there might be some noise in the initial results that needs filtering out.\n\nTo approach this systematically, I'll use the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal technique. This technique involves constructing a conceptual graph based on the query, identifying core concepts and entities, and then traversing the graph to find relevant expansion terms. The core concepts here appear to be \"fines,\" \"perception,\" \"punishment,\" \"revenue,\" and \"justice.\" The search intent seems informational, aiming to understand how the framing of fines affects their deterrent capability and the broader implications on justice and societal perception.\n\nConstructing the conceptual graph, I start with these core nodes and then expand to first-order connections like \"criminal behavior,\" \"deterrence,\" \"legal policy,\" and \"ethical considerations.\" Second-order connections might include \"behavioral economics,\" \"alternative sentencing,\" and \"restorative justice,\" which can provide a richer context for understanding how fines are perceived and their impact on society.\n\nFor expansion path selection, I identify several promising directions: synonymous terms (e.g., \"penalties\" for \"fines\"), hierarchical terms (e.g., \"legal consequences\" as a broader concept), compositional terms (e.g., \"fine structures\" as a component of legal policy), and contextual terms (e.g., \"socioeconomic factors\" influencing perception of fines). Domain-specific terminology could include \"criminology,\" \"jurisprudence,\" and \"public policy.\"\n\nExtracting and filtering terms, I look for those that are highly relevant, distinctive, specific, and searchable. Terms like \"proportionate fines,\" \"income-based penalties,\" \"deterrent effect,\" \"justice perception,\" and \"behavioral economics of crime\" seem promising. They maintain the original search intent while offering alternative pathways for retrieval.\n\nAs I apply the technique's steps, I also consider natural thought patterns. I have occasional false starts, like initially considering the relevance of space exploration to the query, but quickly realize it's a tangent. I make intuitive connections, such as recognizing how the perception of fines as revenue rather than punishment might relate to broader societal trust in institutions. Briefly, I step back to reassess how these expansion terms might interact with each other and the original query, ensuring they enhance rather than distort the search intent.\n\nThrough this process, insights emerge from both the structured approach and my intuition. Applying the conceptual graph traversal technique leads me to terms like \"alternative crime deterrents\" and \"ethical implications of fines,\" which complement my instinctual realization that the query touches on deep issues of justice, fairness, and human behavior. The technique helps systematical identify \"behavioral economics of compliance with fines\" as a crucial aspect, which my intuition agrees is pivotal in understanding why people might view fines as merely a cost of doing business rather than a moral deterrent.\n\nSynthesizing my findings with clarity, I believe the expanded query should include terms that reflect the complex interplay between the perception of fines, their structure, and their impact on criminal behavior and societal justice. Terms such as \"impact of framing fines as punishment vs. revenue on deterrence,\" \"alternative crime deterrents,\" \"effectiveness of different fine structures,\" \"ethical implications of fines,\" and \"behavioral economics of compliance with fines\" capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking. These terms, derived from a combination of structured technique and natural cognitive patterns, should significantly enhance the retrieval of relevant documents and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the query's subject matter.",
