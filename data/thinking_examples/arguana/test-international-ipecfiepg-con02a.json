  "query": "Defaulting would not solve Greece\u2019s problems  The proposition argue that the hardship endured by the default would only be temporary, but an analysis at the particular situation facing Greece indicates the opposite. Greece\u2019s problems arose from a horrifically inefficient public sector embedded within a mentality of corruption and tax evasion. Even if we assume that defaulting would eventually boost Greek exports and help the economy recover, this would not solve the underlying problems that caused the crisis in the first place. By leaving the Eurozone and defaulting, Greece would lose easy access to borrowing, meaning that taxpayers would soon have to face the reality that they would have to pay for the inefficiencies within the public sector and support all the other structures that need reform. [1] Greece must, therefore, address these underlying issues or face the exact same problems in the future. Given that solving these problems necessarily involve austerity measures and job cuts, it makes most sense for Greece to undergo these changes now (as it is with the current austerity measures), under the framework of IMF, ECB and European Commission funding and supervision.

  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n... Uncertainty breeds risk and risk breeds fear: a recipe that drives away foreign investors and makes it difficult for local businesses to start up. Were Greece to default, however, such elements of uncertainty would be seriously diminished, and conditions would be ripe for investment from abroad and locally. Greek would be able to start afresh.  [1] Pettifor, Ann: \u201cGreece: The upside of default\u201d, 23 May 2012, BBC News,   [2] Lapavitsas, Costas: \u201cEurozone crisis: what if\u2026 Greece leaves the single currency\u201d, 14 May 2012, The Guardian,\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: The proposition vastly understates the negative impact a default has on the local economy. It is unrealistic to compare Greece with Argentina. As a member of the Eurozone, the developments within the Greek debt crisis have a huge impact on nations suffering from similar problems, as well as the Eurozone as a whole. Moreover, devaluing the Drachma would be nowhere near as beneficial as the proposition suggests. Greece is not rich in natural resources or industry and so boosting exports will not make a huge difference.  Yes, a default would resolve the uncertainty about whether Greece will default and exit the Euro. However this new predictability would not be good; it would simply show investors that they cannot invest in Greece because they will lose their money. Ratings agencies are unlikely to consider Greece a safe investment for a long time so there will not be international investment.[1]  [1] Pappa, Eppi: \u201cQ&amp;A: What happens if Greece leaves the euro?\u201d, 14 May 2012, Al Jazeera,\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: The situation in Ireland, Italy, Spain and Portugal is not as extreme as that faced by Greece. It is therefore highly unlikely that a Greek default would have as severe a domino effect as the opposition suggests. Greece is the main source of political and economic uncertainty in the Eurozone, and their departure would ease the situation, facilitate investors and allow for the Eurozone to rally strongly.

  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"Defaulting would not solve Greece's problems,\" this makes me think of the complexities of economic crises and the potential consequences of defaulting on debt. The user might actually be trying to understand the underlying issues that led to Greece's economic situation and whether defaulting is a viable solution. Hmm, not sure yet, but it seems like there are multiple facets to consider, including the impact on the public sector, corruption, tax evasion, and the role of international organizations like the IMF and ECB.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the top documents highlight the uncertainty and risk associated with defaulting, as well as the potential benefits of leaving the Eurozone. However, they also emphasize the uniqueness of Greece's situation compared to other countries, like Argentina, and the limitations of devaluing the Drachma due to Greece's lack of natural resources and industry. This suggests that the original query terms might be too narrow or not fully capture the nuances of the situation.\n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here, so let me approach this using the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal technique, which involves constructing a conceptual graph and traversing it to find high-value expansion terms. This should help because it allows me to systematically explore related concepts and entities, identifying potential blind spots in the original query.\n\nFollowing the technique, I start by identifying core concepts and entities in the original query, such as \"Greece,\" \"economic crisis,\" \"default,\" and \"public sector.\" The search intent appears to be informational, seeking to understand the consequences of defaulting and the underlying issues. Implicit assumptions include the impact of default on the economy and the potential role of international organizations.\n\nNext, I construct the conceptual graph, starting with core nodes like \"Greece\" and \"economic crisis,\" and then adding first-order connections like \"public sector\" and \"corruption.\" Second-order connections might include \"international investment,\" \"Eurozone stability,\" and \"political uncertainty.\" Domain contexts could involve economics, politics, and international relations.\n\nFor expansion path selection, I identify promising directions such as synonymous terms (e.g., \"fiscal crisis\" instead of \"economic crisis\"), hierarchical terms (e.g., \"sovereign debt\" as a broader concept), compositional terms (e.g., \"public sector reform\" as a component of addressing corruption), contextual terms (e.g., \"Eurozone crisis\" as a setting), and domain-specific terminology (e.g., \"austerity measures\" in the context of economic policy).\n\nAs I extract and filter terms for each expansion path, I consider criteria like relevance, distinctiveness, specificity, and searchability. Synonymous terms might include \"bankruptcy\" or \"insolvency,\" while hierarchical terms could be \"macroeconomic instability\" or \"global economic trends.\" Compositional terms might involve \"debt restructuring\" or \"fiscal policy reforms,\" and contextual terms could include \"political instability\" or \"social unrest.\" Domain-specific terms might be \"monetary policy\" or \"fiscal discipline.\"\n\nThrough this process, I start to see insights emerging from both the structured technique and my natural thought patterns. Applying the conceptual graph traversal leads me to terms like \"fiscal crisis management\" and \"economic restructuring,\" which seem highly relevant. My instinct also suggests considering terms like \"political will\" and \"social cohesion,\" as these might influence the success of economic reforms.\n\nAs I step back to reassess, I realize that the expanded terms should maintain the original search intent while providing valuable alternative pathways for retrieval. The final set of expansion terms should balance specificity and generality, ensuring they are precise enough to capture the nuances of Greece's economic situation but broad enough to encompass related concepts and entities.\n\nThe final expanded terms that emerge from this process include \"fiscal crisis,\" \"sovereign debt,\" \"public sector reform,\" \"austerity measures,\" \"economic restructuring,\" \"political instability,\" and \"social unrest.\" These terms capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, including the consequences of defaulting, the role of international organizations, and the underlying issues within Greece's economy.\n\nSynthesizing these insights with clarity, I believe the augmented query should incorporate these expansion terms in a weighted manner, ensuring that the original query intent is preserved while enhancing the retrieval of relevant documents. The resulting augmented query would be: \"Greece economic crisis consequences default public sector corruption tax evasion exports austerity reforms Eurozone IMF ECB European Commission fiscal crisis sovereign debt public sector reform austerity measures economic restructuring political instability social unrest.\"",
