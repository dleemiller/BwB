The rate of unemployment in Sub-Saharan Africa remains above the global average, at 7.55% in 2011, with 77% of the population in vulnerable employment [1] . Economic growth has not been inclusive and jobs are scarce. In particular, rates of youth unemployment, and underemployment, remain a concern [2] . On average, the underutilisation of youths in the labour market across Sub-Saharan Africa stood at 67% in 2012 (Work4Youth, 2013).

There remains a high percentage of youths within informal employment. Technology can introduce a new dynamic within the job market and access to safer employment.  Secure, high quality jobs, and more jobs, are essential for youths. Access to technology is the only way to meet such demands.

A high proportion of youths have been identified as \u2018idle\u2019 - not in school, training, or work, and not actively seeking employment. Although variations are found, in 2009 only ~2% of male youths, aged 15-24, and ~1% of female youths, who were not in school or employment in Tanzania, were actively looking for work [1] . Without motivation technology will not make a difference.  [1] WDR, 2013.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: Temporary employment for youth acts against freedom of choice for businesses  In a free market the core concept is freedom of choice. The consumer chooses what they want to buy. And by the same measure there needs to be freedom of choice for employers. They need to be able to decide what products to make, how to market them, and who to employ. Companies should be looking for those who are best qualified for the job rather than satisfying a government quota to provide temporary contracts to young people.  Even if the government is paying for this employee they are still utilising the resources of businesses. Businesses will often have limited space so having some of that space taken up by mandated temporary workers is not the most productive use that the company could be making of that space.  It is clear that this would be a \u2018make work\u2019 scheme because there are already only around two million vacancies, compared to five and a half million unemployed under 25s, in the entire European Union [1] . Moreover that these vacancies exist shows that the real problem is with matching jobs and workers with the right skills. This is best done by training not temporary, probably unskilled, employment.

The rate of unemployment in Sub-Saharan Africa remains above the global average, at 7.55% in 2011, with 77% of the population in vulnerable employment [1] .

[3] Work4Youth (2013) show, on average, Madagascar has the lowest rate of unemployment (2.2%) while Tanzania has the highest (42%); and the average rate of female unemployment stands higher at 25.3%, in contrast to men (20.2%).\" This makes me think of the potential for technology to not only provide new job opportunities but also to address the issues of underemployment and informal employment among youths in Sub-Saharan Africa. Though the user might actually be trying to understand how technology can be leveraged to create a more inclusive and sustainable job market for youths, there seems to be an underlying concern about the current state of unemployment and its geographical and gender-based disparities.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that while they touch upon the potential of technology to create new employment opportunities, they lack specific examples and in-depth analysis of relevant technologies and their successful implementation in Sub-Saharan Africa. The search results at k=1, k=2, and k=10 provide some insights into the challenges of youth unemployment, the role of technology, and the importance of skills and training. However, they do not fully address the query's focus on technology-driven solutions for youth employment in Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nTo expand this query effectively, I need to transition to a more structured approach. Let me approach this using the Conceptual Graph Traversal technique, which involves constructing a conceptual graph with core nodes (direct entities/concepts from the query), first-order connections (direct properties, attributes, and relationships), second-order connections (related concepts one step removed), and domain contexts (specialized fields where this query has meaning). This should help because it will allow me to systematically identify and explore relevant concepts, relationships, and contexts that can enhance the query.\n\nFollowing the Conceptual Graph Traversal approach, I start by identifying the core concepts: technology, youth employment, Sub-Saharan Africa, skills, and policy. Then, I consider the first-order connections, such as the relationship between technology and job creation, the impact of unemployment on youths, and the role of skills and training in employment. Next, I explore second-order connections, including the potential of digital skills, mobile technology, e-commerce, renewable energy, agricultural technology, and fintech in creating employment opportunities for youths.\n\nAs I apply the technique's steps systematically, I also consider natural cognitive elements, such as occasional false starts or reconsiderations. For instance, I initially thought to focus solely on digital skills, but then I realized the importance of including other technologies like renewable energy and agricultural technology, given their potential for job creation in Sub-Saharan Africa. Intuitive connections also play a role, as I recognize that successful initiatives in other regions could provide valuable lessons for Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nInterspersing systematic application with natural thought patterns, I have moments of stepping back to reassess, such as when I consider the challenges and opportunities related to technology adoption and implementation in Sub-Saharan Africa. This leads me to think about the need for policies and programs that promote technology-driven youth employment, as well as the importance of addressing the digital divide and ensuring access to technology for all youths.\n\nThrough this process, insights emerge from both the structure of the technique and my intuition. Applying specific aspects of the Conceptual Graph Traversal technique leads me to discover terms like \"digital skills training programs,\" \"mobile technology and entrepreneurship,\" and \"",
