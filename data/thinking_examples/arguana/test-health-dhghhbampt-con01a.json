  "query": "A huge number of fully accepted medical practices started being seen as something a bit off the wall, it\u2019s wrong to deny sick people access to a treatment that may be mainstream in 20 years  There is a fine line between what is considered alternative and what is thought of as mainstream. Techniques do move across that line and when they do so, they are seen as mainstream. However, this process of reform, refinement and acceptance takes time.  In the meantime it is simply unfair to deny treatment to patients who want it because the medical establishment is beholden to a conservative academic orthodoxy and drug and treatment providers with vested interests in ensuring that particular cures and techniques will continue to be purchased and utilised.",

  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: It is cruel to deny people the last hope  At a point when all ordinary medical avenues have been expended, and the outcome appears bleak, new treatments still undergoing trials can be seen as the last hope.  People are often aware of the existence of currently experimental drugs, they are likely to research into possible cures, and indeed there may have been attempts by their doctor to get the patient onto the trial.  However, not everyone who could benefit from treatment is accepted onto a clinical trial: some trials, at some stages, restrict their recruitment to, for example, patients with no complicating factors or other illnesses.  It is unethical and cruel to make people live out their last days knowing that there was something that could have helped, but to which access was restricted through no fault of their own: thus, you should allow anyone with a terminal illness access to such treatments.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: Although there are many accounts of the efficacy of alternative cancer treatments, not one has been demonstrated to work in a clinical trial  The National Centre for Conventional and Alternative Medicines has spent over $2.5bn on research since 1992. The Dutch government funded research between 1996 and 2003. Alternative therapies have been tested in mainstream medical journals and elsewhere. Not only have thousands of research exercises failed to prove the medical benefit \u201dalternative\u201d treatments for severe and terminal diseases, serious peer-reviewed studies have routinely disproved them.  It\u2019s all well and good to pick at mistakes in individual studies. Indeed, this tactic often forms the mainstay of pleas for legitimacy made by members of the alternative medical community. However, the odds against such consistently negative results would be extraordinary.  By contrast, conventional medicine only prescribes medicines and treatments that are proven, and vigorously proven, to work.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n... Yet, if we start to take into account all the factors that determine who \"deserves\" to be prioritized for healthcare, then we are left with the unsavory, illiberal practice of Social Darwinism. 1 Harvard School of Public Health, \"Four Preventable Risk Factors Reduce Life Expectancy in U.S. and Lead to Health Disparities\", 22 March 2010, accessed 24 August 2010.\n",
  "thought_process": "As I delve into the original query, \"A huge number of fully accepted medical practices started being seen as something a bit off the wall, it\u2019s wrong to deny sick people access to a treatment that may be mainstream in 20 years,\" I find myself pondering the complexities of medical innovation and the ethical dilemmas that arise when patients are denied access to potentially beneficial treatments. The query resonates with concerns about the conservative nature of the medical establishment and the influence of pharmaceutical interests on what treatments are deemed acceptable.\n\nMy initial impressions are that the query touches on a deeply personal and emotional aspect of healthcare, where patients and their families are seeking hope and relief from suffering. The mention of alternative treatments and the recognition that some practices may become mainstream in the future suggests a dynamic and evolving landscape of medical knowledge.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the top documents discuss the tension between providing access to experimental treatments and ensuring the safety and efficacy of these treatments. The text snippets highlight the ethical considerations, with some arguing that it is cruel to deny people access to potentially life-saving treatments, while others emphasize the importance of rigorous testing and evidence-based medicine.\n\nAs I transition to a structured approach using the Query Expansion via Community Q&A Patterns technique, I recognize that this method involves reframing the original query to capture the nuances of community discussions. This technique encourages me to consider how people might ask questions, share their experiences, and engage in debates around this topic.\n\nApplying the technique, I start by reframing the query into personal experience questions, such as \"What is it like to seek alternative medical treatments when mainstream medicine denies them?\" or \"How should patients advocate for access to treatments not yet widely accepted?\" I also consider opinion-based questions like \"What do people think about the delay in recognizing potentially beneficial medical practices?\" and comparison questions such as \"Which is better, waiting for official approval or accessing new treatments through alternative means?\"\n\nThe next step involves identifying the hidden motivations behind these questions, such as seeking validation, personal decision support, or emotional connection. I notice that individuals may be looking for reassurance that exploring alternative treatments is not irrational or seeking support in making difficult healthcare decisions.\n\nAs I analyze the potential answer archetypes, I realize that valuable responses might include first-person narratives from individuals who have benefited from experimental treatments, expert opinions discussing the future of current alternative medical practices, and practical advice on how patients can navigate the system to access promising but unapproved treatments.\n\nThe community interactions around this topic are likely to involve debates about the safety and efficacy of alternative treatments, requests for clarifications on specific treatments, and discussions about how other countries handle experimental treatments. The vocabulary extracted from these conversations might include terms related to personal experiences, emotional support, and community-specific jargon.\n\nThrough this process, I gain insights into how the original query can be expanded to capture the complexities and nuances of community discussions around alternative medical treatments. The expanded query, \"Navigating the path from alternative to mainstream medical treatments: patient experiences, ethical considerations, and advocacy for access in a conservative medical establishment,\" reflects a deeper understanding of the topic and the concerns of individuals seeking information and support.\n\nBy applying the Query Expansion via Community Q&A Patterns technique and balancing structured steps with natural thought patterns, I have developed a more comprehensive understanding of the original query and its potential evolution in a community Q&A context. This approach has allowed me to uncover valuable terms and phrases that reflect how real people discuss this topic, ultimately informing the development of a more effective and empathetic search query.",
