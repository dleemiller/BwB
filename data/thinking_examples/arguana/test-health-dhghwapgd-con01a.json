  "query": "Generic drugs often prove to be less effective than their brand name counterparts, and can even be dangerous  Generic drugs are meant to retain a substantial degree of bioequivalence with their brand name predecessors. Yet, even under strict testing laws in this regard, generic drugs have on several cases been shown to manifest side effects not present in their parent products. For example, a generic version of Wellbutrin XL, an anti-depressant, that was ostensibly chemically equivalent to the brand name drug, caused suicidal episodes in several users1. This demonstrates that no amount of chemical testing can guarantee true bioequivalence, and thus generic drugs cannot be considered as identical to brand name drugs in terms of safety. While improving testing of generics would go some way toward fixing this problem, it would not do so entirely, as the market for new drugs will be so greatly widened with the approval of generic production that the cost of screening will be very high and the likelihood of poor knock-offs reaching consumers, particularly in the developing world where screening is less robust, is increased substantially2. Brand name drugs may be more expensive, but their safety is more thoroughly guaranteed. Flooding the market with cheap, potentially dangerous alternative drugs helps no one but the undertaker.  1 Childs, Dan. 2007. \"Generic Drugs: Dangerous Differences?\". ABC News.

  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: Dangerous generic drugs are rare, and when they are found they are quickly pulled from the market. Arguments against generics on the grounds of safety are no more than alarmist nonsense. When people go to the drug store they have a choice between expensive brand name drugs and cheaper generics. It is their right to economize and choose the less glossy alternative.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: Cheaper drugs aren\u2019t trusted by consumers  The differences in price between generic and patented drugs can be disconcerting to those wishing to buy pharmaceuticals. As with other product, logic generally follows the rule that the more expensive option is the most effective. There are reports from the USA of generic drugs causing suicidal tendencies [1] . These factors, combined with the lower levels of screening for drugs in Africa, mean that cheaper drugs are generally distrusted [2] .  [1] Childs,D. \u2018Generic Drugs: Dangerous Differences?\u2019  [2] Mercurio,B. \u2018Resolving the Public Health Crisis in the Developing World: Problems and Barriers of Access to Essential Medicines\u2019\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: Research and development will continue, irrespective of intellectual property rights. The desire of firms to stay ahead of the competition will drive them to invest in research regardless. That their profits will be diminished by the removal of intellectual property rights is only natural and due to the fact that they will no longer have monopoly control over their intangible assets, and will thus not be able to engage in the rent-seeking behavior inherent in monopoly control of products. The costs of commercialization, which include building factories, developing markets, etc., are often much higher than the costs of the initial conception of an idea1 these are areas where competition will force down costs. Furthermore, there will always be demand for a brand name over a generic product. In this way the initial producer can still profit more than generic producers, if not at monopolistic levels.  1Markey, Justice Howard. 1975. Special Problems in Patent Cases, 66 F.R.D. 529.\n",
  "thought_process": "As I delve into the original query, I'm struck by the concern over the safety of generic drugs compared to their brand-name counterparts. The user's primary objective seems to be understanding the potential risks and differences in bioequivalence and side effects between these two types of medications. However, the initial results, while touching upon cost and accessibility, lack concrete evidence and analysis on the core issues of bioequivalence and potential side effects. This indicates a need for a more focused approach to address the user's primary concern.\n\nStarting with the original query, I notice terms like \"generic drugs\" and \"brand name drugs\" are too broad and could lead to non-precise results. These terms should be avoided in the expansion to ensure we're targeting the right information. The query also hints at the importance of clinical trials, preclinical studies, and post-marketing surveillance in assessing the safety and efficacy of generic drugs.\n\nTo expand the query effectively, I'll apply a structured approach using the guidelines provided. First, I'll focus on targeted expansions that introduce new dimensions to the query, ensuring specificity and diversity. The terms \"bioavailability,\" \"plasma concentration,\" \"drug interactions,\" \"clinical trials,\" \"preclinical studies,\" and \"post-marketing surveillance\" stand out as key areas to explore further. These terms are not only relevant to the safety concerns of generic drugs but also offer a pathway to understanding the intricacies of drug development and regulation.\n\nAs I apply the technique of breadth expansion, terms like \"pharmacokinetics,\" \"drug metabolism,\" \"therapeutic efficacy,\" \"regulatory oversight,\" and \"comparative pharmacology\" come into play. These terms expand the query by introducing concepts that are closely related to the bioequivalence and safety of generic drugs. However, to truly deepen our understanding, we must drill down into one of these areas.\n\nLet's consider \"drug interactions\" as a focal point for depth expansion. Understanding how generic drugs interact with other medications, foods, or diseases is crucial for assessing their safety and efficacy. This leads to exploring terms like \"bioavailability,\" \"plasma concentration,\" and the impact of these factors on drug interactions. The process involves systematically applying the expansion technique while allowing for natural cognitive elements, such as reconsidering the importance of certain terms or exploring tangents that might yield unexpected insights.\n\nFor instance, while examining \"bioavailability,\" I'm reminded of the concept of \"pharmacokinetic profiling,\" which could provide valuable insights into how generic drugs are absorbed, distributed, metabolized, and excreted by the body. Similarly, delving into \"plasma concentration\" leads to considerations of how drug dosages might need to be adjusted to achieve therapeutic levels without inducing toxicity.\n\nThrough this structured yet intuitively guided process, the expanded query begins to take shape. Terms like \"bioavailability,\" \"plasma concentration,\" \"drug interactions,\" \"clinical trials,\" \"preclinical studies,\" and \"post-marketing surveillance\" emerge as central to understanding the safety and efficacy of generic drugs. These terms not only capture the explicit concerns of the original query but also incorporate implicit aspects related to drug development, regulation, and patient safety.\n\nUpon reflection, it's clear that the technique of query expansion, when balanced with natural thought patterns, allows for a comprehensive and nuanced exploration of the topic. By systematically applying the steps of the technique while remaining open to intuitive connections and reconsiderations, we can craft an augmented query that is both targeted and diverse. The final terms included in the augmented query\u2014such as \"bioavailability,\" \"plasma concentration,\" \"drug interactions,\" \"clinical trials,\" \"preclinical studies,\" and \"post-marketing surveillance\"\u2014logically emerge from both the structured technique and the natural insights gained during the expansion process.\n\nIn synthesizing the findings with clarity, it becomes evident that the augmented query effectively addresses the user's primary concern about the safety of generic drugs. By focusing on specific aspects of drug development and regulation, such as bioequivalence, side effects, and clinical trials, we can better understand the complexities involved in ensuring the safety and efficacy of generic medications. This not only enhances our ability to retrieve relevant information but also contributes to a more informed discussion about the role of generic drugs in healthcare.",
