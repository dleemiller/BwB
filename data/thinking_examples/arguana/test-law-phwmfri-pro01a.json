  "query": "Rich and poor now face equality of impact of punishment  The purpose of a fine is to ensure that the offender faces the consequences of their actions. The extent to which a financial penalty feels like a negative consequence is relative to the amount of income someone has, not to the simple amount that the fine is. That is, if someone earning \u00a3200 per week is fined \u00a3100, that will feel more severe than a \u00a3100 fine would feel to someone earning \u00a32000 per week.  Therefore, if you make fines proportional to the income someone has, all people feel the impact of the punishment equally, rather than the poor facing a punishment with a harsher impact on them than on the rich.",

  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: Even if a fine is made proportional to income, you will not get the equality of impact you desire. This is because the impact is not proportional simply to income, but must take into account a number of other factors. For example, someone supporting a family will face a greater impact than someone who is not, because they have a smaller disposable income. Further, a fine based on income ignores overall wealth (i.e. how much money someone actually has: someone might have a lot of assets but not have a high income).  The proposition does not cater for these inequalities, which may well have a much greater skewing effect, and therefore the argument is being applied inconsistently.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n... This will improve perceptions of (and consequently, relations with) the justice and law enforcement systems.  It is important that justice is seen to be done, as well as occurring (sometimes referred to as the Principle of Open Justice), for several reasons. First, we operate a system of government by consent: people\u2019s opinions of the justice system are deemed an important check and balance on the power of the law-makers. Consequently, if they are seen to \u2018abuse their power\u2019 by imposing a law seen to be unfair, they have an obligation either to adequately explain and defend the law, or change it.  Second, people\u2019s perceptions of law enforcement in one area spill over into other areas: it is the same police force enforcing all aspects of the law, and so the differences in policy origin are obscured. Consequently, if people deem law-enforcement to be unfair in one regard, they are less likely to trust it in other circumstances.  Third, it is important that the justice system is seen to be impartial, rather than favouring any particular group, because it is only under such circumstances that its designations of acts as \u2018crimes\u2019 can be seen as a true reflection of what you ought and ought not to do, rather than just what would be in the interests of a given group.  1 \u2018Justice and The Poor\u2019, National Council of Welfare, 10 September 2012,\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: The aim of taxation should be to provide equality of opportunity, not of outcom  Taxation should not be about trying to engineer a more equal society. The purpose of taxes is to furnish necessary services people need to become competitive free agents in the economy. Progressive taxes take unduly from some to give to others in the hope of fostering social equality. Yet such efforts can only be harmful, as they breed resentment from rich toward the poor for taking undue amounts of their wealth for their consumption, and feelings of entitlement from poor who feel the wealthy owe them the money they pay, and thus feel happy to levy ever more odious taxes from them. [1] Society is best served by promoting a system of taxation that fosters equality of opportunity, by providing essential services to which everyone contributes in accordance with their ability to pay. This is better serviced through a system of flat-taxes, such as in Russia where there is a flat tax of 13%, [2] that promote a system of proportionality in taxation, rather than progressive taxes that focus unduly upon the contributions of the few to the many.

  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"Rich and poor now face equality of impact of punishment,\" this makes me think of the concept of fairness in the justice system. The user is highlighting the issue of fixed fine amounts having a disproportionate impact on lower-income individuals. Though the user might actually be trying to explore alternative sentencing options or policy proposals for fairer fines, the primary focus is on the idea of proportionate punishment.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the existing reasoning touches on the concept of fairness and the need to delve deeper into alternatives to fines and policy solutions. The ineffective terms listed, such as \"impact,\" \"purpose,\" \"extent,\" and \"feel,\" suggest that we should avoid broad or non-precise language in our expansion.\n\nTransitioning to a structured approach, I'll be using the expansion technique provided, which involves applying varied augmentation techniques such as synonym replacement, conceptual expansion, contextual expansion, and domain-specific terminology. This should help me discover new, relevant documents across various domains and create a novel augmented query that is free from overlapping the original terms.\n\nStarting with goal elucidation and gaps, I examine the original query to understand its primary objectives and gaps. The main goal is to understand the concept of proportionate punishment, explore alternative sentencing options, and identify policy proposals for fairer fines. The gaps in the original query include the lack of specificity and diversity in the search terms.\n\nMoving on to ineffective term identification, I've already listed the broad or non-precise terms to avoid, which include \"impact,\" \"purpose,\" \"extent,\" and \"feel.\" These terms should be replaced with more targeted and diverse language.\n\nFor breadth expansion, I've listed candidate terms with increasingly distant concepts to the original query, such as \"community service,\" \"restorative justice,\" \"asset forfeiture,\" \"economic inequality,\" \"criminal justice reform,\" and \"sentencing guidelines.\" These terms introduce new dimensions to the query and provide a foundation for further expansion.\n\nIn the depth expansion phase, I choose one distant but important topic from the breadth expansion, which is \"rehabilitation programs.\" I then go increasingly deeper in the related terms on this topic, exploring concepts such as \"alternatives to incarceration,\" \"social impact bonds,\" \"employment training,\" \"housing assistance,\" and \"poverty reduction initiatives.\" These terms provide a more nuanced understanding of the topic and can help identify relevant policy proposals.\n\nAs I apply the expansion technique, I start to see insights emerging from both the structured approach and my natural thought patterns. For example, the concept of \"restorative justice\" reminds me of the importance of community involvement in the justice system, which is a key aspect of rehabilitation programs. Similarly, the idea of \"asset forfeiture\" leads me to consider the role of economic inequality in shaping criminal justice outcomes.\n\nThrough this process, I begin to synthesize the various threads and concepts, considering how they relate to the original query and the desired outcomes. I realize that the augmented query should include terms that capture the essence of proportionate punishment, alternative sentencing options, and policy proposals for fairer fines.\n\nThe final augmented query, \"community service restorative justice asset forfeiture economic inequality sentencing guidelines rehabilitation programs,\" emerges from this process, incorporating targeted and diverse language that introduces new dimensions to the original query. This query is designed to retrieve relevant documents that explore the complexities of the justice system and provide insights into creating a more equitable and fair society.\n\nBy balancing the structured approach with my natural thought patterns, I've created an augmented query that is both novel and relevant, avoiding generic or general statements and focusing on specific, high-quality search terms.",
