  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: The relation between employment, money, and household poverty is not a simple correlation when we consider the type of jobs women are entering. In developing countries work in the informal economy is a large source of women\u2019s employment (Chen et al, 2004). In the case of Sub-Saharan Africa, 84% of women in non-agricultural work are in the informal economy (ILO, 2002). Only 63% of men work in the informal economy. Women represent a large proportion of individuals working in informal employment and within the informal sector. Informal employment means employment lacks protection and/or benefits, and the informal sector involves unregistered or unincorporated private enterprises.  Such a reality limits the capability to use employment to escape poverty (see Chant, 2010). With wages low, jobs casual and insecure, and limited access to social protection schemes or rights-based labour policies, women are integrated into vulnerable employment conditions. Data has shown informal employment to be correlated with income per capita (negative), and poverty (positive) (ILO, 2011). Further, the jobs are precarious and volatile - affected by global economic crisis.  Women\u2019s employment in Africa needs to be met with \u2018decent\u2019 work [1] , or women will be placed in risky conditions.  [1] See further readings: ILO, 2014.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: Women become integrated into a man\u2019s world. But the territory may not be changed. First, women may become like men in response to the jobs they take up and how one is expected to act in the given role. When we consider what conditions women are introduced, potentially with limited training in public speaking, confidence or acceptance, how will they fare? Their best way forward is to get help from the men already in parliament.  Secondly, how do women experience work and are they treated at work? Quotas introduce more women, however, they may experience gender-based harassment and unfair treatment at work. In the case of Kenya, a female politician was publicly slapped [1] . Who will ensure their rights are protected and they are treated equally in a political world?  Finally, is power redistributed? Frequent protests in Senegal show that despite quota systems being implemented women do not end up with power despite being in parliament. [2] Women are legally enrolled into local and national parties but do their seats ensure they can lead political parties? Does being a local candidate ensure the potential for national progression?  [1] African Spotlight, 2013.  [2] Kabwila, 2012.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: A true role model has to be admired. Encouraging more women to stand for election should not be about 'making up numbers': women are extremely capable of becoming elected without help from male party leaders. Shirley Chisholm, in a famous speech on gender equality to Congress in Washington, U.S., on 21st May 1969, aired a similar sentiment: \"women need no protection that men do not need. What we need are laws to protect working people, to guarantee them fair pay, safe working conditions, protection against sickness and layoffs and provision for dignified, comfortable retirement. Men and women need these things equally. That one sex need protection more than the other is a male supremacist myth as ridiculous and unworthy of respect as the white supremacist myth that society is trying to cure itself of at this time\"1. Apportioning a quota of seats for women or all-women shortlists will be a patronising implication that women cannot succeed off the back of their own merits, and that men are innately superior. This does not create inspirational role models.  1 Full transcript of speech, 'Equal Rights for Women' by Shirley Chisholm:\n",
  "thought_process": "As I delve into the query \"Where are the men? Is the feminisation of labour emerging with a de-masculinisation of jobs? If so, how do women cope in the work environment? Are methods being integrated to ensure a just work environment is maintained?\" I find myself pondering the intricate dynamics of gender roles in the labor market. The user's inquiry seems to touch on multiple facets: the shift in traditional gender-based occupations, the implications of this shift on both men and women, and the quest for a fair and equitable work environment.\n\nInitially, my thoughts wander to the concept of \"feminization of labor\" and its counterpart, \"de-masculinization of jobs.\" These terms evoke images of a changing workplace where gender stereotypes are being challenged. I consider how women entering traditionally male-dominated fields might face unique challenges, from adapting to new work cultures to overcoming inherent biases. Conversely, I think about men taking on roles typically associated with women, and how this might affect their self-perception and societal expectations.\n\nThe query also prompts me to analyze the provided text snippets from various documents. The first snippet highlights the prevalence of women in the informal economy, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa, and the vulnerabilities that come with such employment, including low wages, job insecurity, and limited access to social protection. This leads me to consider the broader context of economic stability and how gender plays a role in it.\n\nThe second snippet shifts my focus to the political arena, where women's integration into a \"man's world\" raises questions about their treatment, opportunities for advancement, and the effectiveness of quota systems in ensuring gender equality. It's clear that simply increasing the number of women in positions of power does not automatically guarantee their rights or influence.\n\nAs I transition to applying the \"Query Expansion Through Journalistic Investigation\" technique, I start by assessing the query's underlying needs. The user is seeking a comprehensive understanding of the gender shift in labor markets, including its impacts on both genders, the challenges faced in changing occupational roles, and the policies or strategies that could promote a just work environment.\n\nNext, I identify diverse real-world scenarios where this query is relevant, spanning professional contexts, educational settings, personal situations, and specialized communities. This broadens my perspective, allowing me to consider the query's implications across different sectors and societies.\n\nThe process of creating headlines for articles addressing the query from multiple angles helps me distill the key issues and potential storylines. Headlines like \"The Great Gender Shift: Are Men Losing Ground in the Job Market?\" and \"Building a Just Work Environment: Strategies for Bridging the Gender Gap\" reflect the query's core themes and encourage a deeper exploration of related concepts and terminology.\n\nThrough this investigative approach, I extract specific terms that represent precise concepts related to the query, including \"gender roles,\" \"labor market,\" \"feminization of labor,\" \"de-masculinization of jobs,\" and \"workplace culture.\" These terms, combined with the original query intent, form the basis of an augmented query that captures the complexity and nuance of the user's information needs.\n\nThe augmented query, \"impact gender shifts labor markets specifically feminization labor de masculinization jobs women men adapt changing occupational roles sectors like retail challenges faced genders including workplace culture fairness wages career advancement need policies promoting gender equality changing work environment,\" reflects a comprehensive and structured approach to understanding the gender dynamics in the labor market. It encapsulates the user's quest for insights into the shifting gender roles, the challenges and implications of these shifts, and the pursuit of equity and justice in the workplace.\n\nIn synthesizing my thought process, I realize that applying a structured technique like \"Query Expansion Through Journalistic Investigation\" enhances my ability to uncover the depth and breadth of the query's underlying questions. It allows me to balance systematic analysis with natural cognitive patterns, such as making intuitive connections and exploring tangential ideas. The outcome is a richer, more nuanced understanding of the topic, equipped with specific terms and concepts that can guide further inquiry or practical application.\n\nThrough this process, I have demonstrated how an expert's thought process can combine structured techniques with organic thinking, leveraging both to yield a comprehensive and insightful approach to query expansion. The final augmented query emerges as a culmination of this blend of systematic analysis and intuitive exploration, poised to facilitate a more informed and targeted investigation into the complex issues surrounding gender shifts in labor markets.",
