  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"Antigua and Barbuda was named in honor of the Panagia,\" this makes me think of the religious significance behind the naming of the country. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the historical context, I sense there's a deeper inquiry into the connection between the name 'Antigua' and the Virgin of La Antigua. Hmm, not sure yet how these pieces fit together, but it seems like the Panagia, a term often associated with the Virgin Mary in Orthodox Christianity, is a crucial element.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that most of the information focuses on geographical and historical aspects of Antigua and Barbuda, such as its location, population, and governance structure. However, there's a notable lack of discussion on the religious context of its naming. The terms \"Antigua and Barbuda\" and \"named\" seem too broad and don't lead to the specific religious insights the user is likely seeking.\n\nTo approach this query expansion systematically, I'll use the technique of breadth and depth expansion. This involves first identifying a wide range of related concepts (breadth expansion) and then selecting a specific area to delve deeper into (depth expansion). The breadth expansion terms like \"Virgin Mary,\" \"Christianity,\" \"Spanish colonization,\" \"Pan-Orthodox,\" \"Caribbean religious practices,\" and \"folklore\" offer a broad spectrum of topics related to the religious and cultural context of Antigua and Barbuda's naming.\n\nFor depth expansion, focusing on the \"Virgin of La Antigua\" seems promising, as it directly relates to the Panagia and the naming of Antigua. Exploring terms like \"Marian devotion,\" \"iconography,\" \"hagiography,\" and \"religious festivals\" can provide a deeper understanding of the religious significance and practices surrounding the Virgin of La Antigua, which in turn can illuminate the naming of Antigua and Barbuda.\n\nFollowing the expansion technique, I should first list out the ineffective terms that don't contribute much to the query, such as \"Antigua and Barbuda\" and \"named,\" as they are too general and don't specifically address the religious context. Then, I move on to breadth expansion, where terms like \"Virgin Mary\" and \"Christianity\" can introduce new dimensions to the query. After that, selecting a key area for depth expansion, such as \"Virgin of La Antigua,\" allows for a more nuanced exploration of the topic.\n\nApplying the technique systematically, I start with the broader concepts and then narrow down to more specific terms related to the Virgin of La Antigua. This process reveals insights into Marian devotion, the significance of iconography and hagiography in understanding religious figures, and how religious festivals might commemorate the Virgin of La Antigua. These insights not only deepen our understanding of the naming of Antigua and Barbuda but also provide a richer context for the original query.\n\nThrough this process of applying the expansion technique and exploring related threads, I believe the terms that would be most effective for a query are those that capture the essence of the religious significance and cultural context, such as \"Virgin Mary,\" \"Virgin of La Antigua,\" \"Marian devotion,\" \"iconography,\" \"hagiography,\" and \"festivals.\" These terms, derived from both the systematic application of the technique and natural intuitive connections, should yield a more targeted and relevant set of results for understanding the religious origin of Antigua and Barbuda's name.",
