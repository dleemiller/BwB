  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"Mikhail Prokhorov is not a former chairman,\" this makes me think of verifying or refuting the claim about Mikhail Prokhorov's past roles. The user might actually be trying to confirm or deny his involvement as a chairman in any organization, but it's not entirely clear which context or sector they are referring to. Hmm, not sure yet how to approach this without more specific information.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that it lists biographical details about multiple individuals with the name Mikhail Prokhorov but lacks specific information about the roles held by this particular person. The initial results provide valuable insights, particularly the text snippet from document at k=1, which mentions Mikhail Prokhorov's background as a Russian billionaire, politician, and owner of the Brooklyn Nets. It also highlights his experience as the former chairman of Polyus Gold and the former President of Onexim Group. This information starts to clarify his professional trajectory and the sectors in which he has been involved.\n\nTo further expand this query, I'll approach it using the \"Query Expansion Through Journalistic Investigation\" technique, which involves treating the query as a story to be researched and expanded upon. This should help because it allows for a deeper dive into the topic by considering various real-world contexts, identifying authoritative sources, and extracting relevant terminology.\n\nFollowing the journalistic investigation approach, the first step is query assessment. Here, I need to analyze what the user is truly seeking, which seems to be confirmation or refutation of Mikhail Prokhorov's role as a chairman. The next step involves identifying real-world contexts where this query is relevant, such as professional contexts within industries like finance, sports, or politics.\n\nThe process then moves to resource investigation, where I identify notable experts and sources. Given Mikhail Prokhorov's diverse career, key sources could include business journals, sports news outlets, and political analysis platforms. Essential terminology and specialized vocabulary might include \"leadership roles,\" \"business management,\" \"sports ownership,\" and \"political candidacy.\"\n\nCreating diverse headlines is the next step, which could range from \"Mikhail Prokhorov: A Career of Leadership and Innovation\" to \"From Sports to Politics: The Diverse Career Path of Mikhail Prokhorov.\" These headlines help in covering different aspects of the query and can lead to extracting specific, high-value search terms.\n\nExtracting terms from these headlines and the initial results, I find terms like \"chairman,\" \"leadership,\" \"entrepreneur,\" \"career path,\" \"business titan,\" \"professional life,\" \"industries,\" \"organizations,\" \"CEO,\" \"president,\" and \"board chairman\" to be particularly relevant. These terms capture the essence of Mikhail Prokhorov's career and the various roles he has held, including leadership positions.\n\nAs I apply the technique systematically, I also allow for natural thought patterns to emerge. For instance, considering Mikhail Prokhorov's involvement in both sports and politics makes me think about the transferable skills between these sectors, such as leadership, strategy, and public relations. This realization can lead to further query expansion by including terms related to skill sets and personal attributes that are valuable in these contexts.\n\nMoreover, the technique's emphasis on real-world contexts and authoritative sources reminds me to consider the historical and evolving nature of Mikhail Prokhorov's career. This includes looking at how his roles and industries have changed over time and how these changes reflect broader trends or shifts in the global economy or political landscape.\n\nThrough this process of applying the journalistic investigation technique and exploring related threads, I believe the terms \"Mikhail Prokhorov career roles chairman positions leadership experiences\" would be most effective for capturing the essence of what the user is seeking. These terms balance the explicit query about Mikhail Prokhorov's past role as a chairman with a broader exploration of his professional life, leadership experiences, and the various sectors in which he has been involved.\n\nThe combination of structured technique and natural cognitive patterns allows for a comprehensive approach to query expansion, ensuring that the final terms emerge logically from both the methodical steps of the technique and the intuitive connections made during the thought process.",
