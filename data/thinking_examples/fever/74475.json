  "reasoning": "The query \"Quay had its first public showing in Manhattan\" is ambiguous. Based on the document types and strengths/weaknesses, a significant challenge is distinguishing whether \"Quay\" refers to the film or another entity (e.g., a place or person). The initial search yielded mostly irrelevant results, indicating that additional context is crucial for accurate retrieval. My strategy is to expand around possible entities \"Quay\" refers to such as the film \"Quay\" directed by Stephen Brothers, or any other relevant artistic showings in Manhattan.",

  "thought_process": "As I begin to tackle the query \"Quay had its first public showing in Manhattan,\" my initial impression is that \"Quay\" could refer to a film, given the context of a \"public showing.\" However, the term is ambiguous and could also refer to a geographical location or another entity entirely. The initial search results provided little clarity, with snippets ranging from descriptions of harbors in Australia to financial services firms in Manhattan. This inconsistency highlights the need for careful query expansion to pinpoint the intended meaning of \"Quay.\"\n\nAnalyzing the results, I notice that the texts from documents at k=1 and k=2 discuss \"Quay\" in the context of geographical locations (Circular Quay in Sydney and Elizabeth Quay in Perth), which seems unrelated to the context of a film or public showing in Manhattan. The text snippet from document at k=10 mentions Morgan Stanley's headquarters in Manhattan but does not relate to \"Quay\" or any form of public showing. This suggests that the initial query may not have been specific enough to capture relevant information about a film or event named \"Quay\" in Manhattan.\n\nTo refine the search, I will apply the query expansion technique via conceptual graph traversal. This involves identifying core concepts (in this case, \"Quay,\" \"public showing,\" and \"Manhattan\"), determining the search intent (informational, to find details about an event or film), and listing implicit assumptions (e.g., \"Quay\" is likely a film or artistic event rather than a geographical location in this context).\n\nConstructing a conceptual graph, I start with core nodes for \"Quay\" (as a film or event), \"public showing\" (premiere, screening, etc.), and \"Manhattan\" (as a location). First-order connections include attributes of these nodes, such as the type of event, the venue, and the date. Second-order connections might involve related concepts like film festivals in Manhattan, arthouse cinemas, or directors associated with the film \"Quay.\"\n\nFor expansion path selection, I identify several promising directions:\n- Synonymous terms for \"public showing\" (e.g., premiere, screening, debut).\n- Hierarchical terms that narrow down the location (e.g., specific venues in Manhattan known for film screenings).\n- Compositional terms related to film events (e.g., film genre, director's name).\n- Contextual terms that might be associated with film showings in Manhattan (e.g., film festivals, indie cinema).\n\nExtracting and filtering terms, I consider relevance, distinctiveness, specificity, and searchability. For the query \"Quay had its first public showing in Manhattan,\" high-value expansion terms might include \"film premiere,\" \"Manhattan cinema,\" \"Brothers Quay\" (if referring to the film directors), \"NYC film festival,\" and \"arthouse film screening.\"\n\nThrough this process of applying query expansion via conceptual graph traversal and considering natural thought patterns and intuitions, I believe the expanded query should effectively capture the intent of finding information about a film or event named \"Quay\" that had its first public showing in Manhattan. The final expanded query, \"quay film premiere screening showing manhattan nyc new york city festival cinema arthouse,\" is designed to balance the structured approach with the organic and intuitive connections made during the thought process, aiming to yield more precise and relevant search results.",
