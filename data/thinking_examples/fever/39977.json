  "thought_process": "When I first look at the query \"Key & Peele has yet to be nominated for a Writers Guild Award,\" my initial impression is that this query is seeking confirmation of a specific event or fact. The user wants to know if Key & Peele has been nominated for a Writers Guild Award or not. My association with this query is to think about awards, nominations, and the recognition of writing in television, particularly in comedy series.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the current results focus on general information about Key & Peele, awards, and writing, but they don't specifically discuss the Writers Guild Award nomination status of Key & Peele. This tells me that the query needs to be expanded to target sources that specifically discuss award nominations, especially those related to writing in television comedy.\n\nTo approach this query expansion systematically, I decide to use a structured technique that involves identifying ineffective terms, performing breadth expansion, and then depth expansion. The technique I choose is based on the guidelines provided, which emphasize being specific and diverse, applying varied augmentation techniques, and ensuring the augmented query is novel and free from overlapping the original terms.\n\nFirst, I identify the ineffective terms in the original query, which are \"Key & Peele,\" \"has yet to be nominated,\" and \"Writers Guild Award.\" These terms are either too broad or not precise enough for the query's objectives.\n\nNext, I perform breadth expansion by listing candidate terms with increasingly distant concepts to the original query. This includes terms like \"television comedy awards,\" \"award shows,\" \"comedy writing recognition,\" \"writers guild,\" and \"screenwriting awards.\" These terms help to introduce new dimensions to the query and move beyond the original keywords.\n\nFor depth expansion, I choose one distant but important topic from the breadth expansion, which is \"Primetime Emmy Awards,\" and go increasingly deeper into related terms. This includes terms like \"Comedy Series Writing nominations\" and \"award nomination history for comedic television series.\" These terms are more targeted and specific, allowing the query to capture the nuances of award nominations in the context of television comedy writing.\n\nAs I apply the technique, I also allow for natural thought patterns to emerge. I consider the relationships between the terms, occasional false starts, and intuitive connections that complement the technique. For instance, thinking about the Primetime Emmy Awards leads me to consider the importance of writing nominations in comedy series, which in turn reminds me of the need to look into the award nomination history for such series.\n\nThrough this process, insights begin to emerge from both the structured approach and my natural intuition. Applying the depth expansion step, for example, leads me to discover terms like \"Comedy Series Writing nominations,\" which are directly relevant to the query's objectives. My instinct also suggests considering terms related to the recognition of comedy writing, such as \"screenwriting awards\" and \"writers guild,\" which can provide a broader context to the query.\n\nSynthesizing all the information and insights gained, I conclude that the most effective terms for the expanded query should include those that capture the specific aspects of award nominations in television comedy writing, such as \"Primetime Emmy Awards,\" \"Comedy Series Writing nominations,\" and \"award nomination history.\" These terms are targeted, unique, and relevant to the original query, ensuring that the augmented query will yield high-quality search results that are diverse and non-overlapping with the original query.\n\nThe final augmented query, \"primetime emmy awards comedy series writing nominations award nomination history,\" reflects this synthesis, combining the structured technique with natural cognitive patterns to create a query that is both novel and effective in capturing the user's information needs.",
