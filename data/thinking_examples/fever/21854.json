New ideas in physics often explain the fundamental mechanisms of other sciences while opening new avenues of research in areas such as mathematics and philosophy .   Physics also makes significant contributions through advances in new technologies that arise from theoretical breakthroughs . For example , advances in the understanding of electromagnetism or nuclear physics led directly to the development of new products that have dramatically transformed modern-day society , such as television , computers , domestic appliances , and nuclear weapons ; advances in thermodynamics led to the development of industrialization , and advances in mechanics inspired the development of calculus .   The United Nations named 2005 the World Year of Physics .\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: Physics outreach ' encompasses facets of science outreach and physics education and is an umbrella term for a variety of activities by schools , research institutes , universities , clubs and institutions such as science museums aimed at broadening the audience for and awareness and understanding of physics . While the general public may sometimes be the focus of such activities , physics outreach often centers on developing and providing resources and making presentations to students , educators in other disciplines , and in some cases researchers within different areas of physics .\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: The biological basis of personality is the collection of brain systems and mechanisms that underlie human personality . Human neurobiology , especially as it relates to complex traits and behaviors , is not well understood , but research into the neuroanatomical and functional underpinnings of personality are an active field of research . Animal models of behavior , molecular biology , and brain imaging techniques have provided some insight into human personality , especially trait theories .   Much of the current understanding of personality from a neurobiological perspective places an emphasis on the biochemistry of the behavioral systems of reward , motivation , and punishment . This has led to a few biologically based personality theories such as Eysenck 's three factor model of personality , Grey 's reinforcement sensitivity theory ( RST ) , and Cloninger 's model of personality . The Big Five model of personality is not biologically based ; yet some research in the differences in brain structures provided biological support also for this model .\n",
  "thought_process": "As I begin to expand the query \"Physics' main goal is to understand the behavior of the universe,\" my initial impressions are that the user is looking for a broad overview of the field of physics, its objectives, and perhaps its relevance to understanding the cosmos. However, the existing results, while providing a general understanding, lack depth in specific areas or current research. This makes me think that the user might actually be trying to delve deeper into the intricacies of physics, its subfields, notable physicists, experimental methods, and contemporary challenges.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that they touch upon the applications of physics, its contributions to technology, and the importance of physics education and outreach. However, they seem to miss the mark on providing a comprehensive view of physics' core aspects and its current state. The text snippets from the initial results highlight the impact of physics on society, the role of physics in inspiring other sciences, and the efforts in physics education and outreach. Yet, there's a clear need to explore physics more thoroughly, including its subfields like cosmology, particle physics, and quantum mechanics, and considering influential figures such as Albert Einstein and Isaac Newton.\n\nTo systematically approach this query expansion, I'll utilize the Conceptual Graph Traversal technique. This involves constructing a conceptual graph that represents the relationships between entities and concepts in the query and then traversing this graph to identify high-value expansion terms. The process begins with query analysis, where I identify core concepts (physics, behavior of the universe) and determine the search intent as informational. I note implicit assumptions, such as the user's interest in both theoretical and practical aspects of physics.\n\nNext, I construct the conceptual graph with core nodes (physics, universe), first-order connections (subfields, physicists, experiments), second-order connections (applications, theories), and domain contexts (scientific research, education). For expansion path selection, I identify promising directions such as synonymous terms (e.g., \"natural philosophy\" for physics), hierarchical terms (subfields like mechanics, electromagnetism), compositional terms (components of the universe, experimental tools), contextual terms (settings where physics applies, like space exploration), and domain-specific terminology (technical terms used in physics research).\n\nAs I extract and filter terms based on relevance, distinctiveness, specificity, and searchability, I consider both the structured steps of the technique and my natural thought patterns. This includes occasional reconsiderations, like realizing that while \"dark matter\" is a relevant term, it might not be directly related to the user's query about the main goal of physics. I also make intuitive connections, such as linking the concept of \"behavior of the universe\" to cosmology and the study of black holes, which are not only intriguing aspects of physics but also directly related to understanding the universe's behavior.\n\nThrough this process, insights emerge from both the structured approach and my intuition. Applying the Conceptual Graph Traversal technique leads to the discovery of terms like \"quantum mechanics\" and \"particle physics,\" which are crucial for understanding the behavior of matter and energy at different scales. My instinct also suggests considering terms related to the applications of physics, such as \"technology\" and \"innovation,\" as they reflect how physics contributes to society and our understanding of the universe.\n\nAs I synthesize my findings with clarity, I believe the expanded terms should include a mix of subfields (cosmology, particle physics), key physicists (Einstein, Newton), experimental methods (particle accelerators), and contemporary challenges (dark matter, quantum computing). These terms capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, enhancing the original query to better reflect the depth and breadth of physics and its pursuit to understand the universe.\n\nThe final expanded query, incorporating these insights, would be: \"Physics, cosmology, particle physics, quantum mechanics, Einstein, Newton, experimental physics, dark matter, challenges in physics, behavior of the universe.\" This expansion maintains the original search intent while providing valuable alternative pathways for retrieval, ensuring a more comprehensive understanding of physics and its main goal to understand the behavior of the universe.",
