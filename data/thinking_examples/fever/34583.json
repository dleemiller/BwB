  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: The Neue Mozart-Ausgabe ( abbreviated as `` NMA '' ; in English , New Mozart Edition ) is the second complete works edition of the music of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart . A longer and more formal title for the edition is Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart . Neue Ausgabe s\u00e4mtlicher Werke .\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: The so-called Symphony No. 3 in E major , K. 18 , once attributed to Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart , is by today 's scholarship considered not to be Mozart 's own work but instead that of Carl Friedrich Abel , a leading German composer of the earlier Classical period .   It was misattributed to Mozart because a manuscript score in the hand of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart , was categorized as his Symphony No. 3 in E , K. 18 , and was published as such in the first complete edition of Mozart 's works by Breitkopf & H\u00e4rtel . Later , it was discovered that this symphony was actually the work of Abel , copied by the boy Mozart ( evidently for study purposes ) while he was visiting London in 1764 . That symphony was originally published as the concluding work in Abel 's Six Symphonies , Op. 7 . However , Mozart 's copy differs from Abel 's published score in that Mozart `` substituted clarinets for the printed oboe parts . ''   It is in three movements :   Molto allegro  Andante  Presto\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n... Neal Zaslaw states that its authorship remains uncertain .   The Alte Mozart-Ausgabe ( published 1879 -- 1882 ) gives the numbering sequence 1 -- 41 for the 41 numbered symphonies . The unnumbered symphonies ( some , including K. 98 , published in supplements to the Alte-Mozart Ausgabe until 1910 ) are sometimes given numbers in the range 42 to 56 , even though they were written earlier than Mozart 's Symphony No. 41 ( written in 1788 ) . The symphony K. 98 is given the number 56 in this numbering scheme .\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was a wrestler,\" my initial impression is that this statement is factually incorrect. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart is widely recognized as a renowned composer and musician, not a wrestler. This discrepancy suggests that the user might be confusing Mozart with someone else or that there's a misunderstanding about Mozart's life and achievements.\n\nAnalyzing the results from the original query, I notice that the top documents retrieved are about Mozart's musical compositions, his contemporaries, and biographical information. This tells me that the search engine is correctly identifying Mozart as a musician but is not addressing the error in the query. The strengths of the search terms lie in their ability to retrieve relevant information about Mozart's musical career, but the weakness is the lack of accuracy in addressing the query's factual mistake.\n\nTo refine the query and make it more accurate, I'll apply the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal technique. This involves constructing a conceptual graph with core nodes representing Mozart, music, and composer, and then identifying first-order and second-order connections to these nodes. The first-order connections include Mozart's compositions, contemporaries like Joseph Haydn and Ludwig van Beethoven, and the classical music genre. Second-order connections might involve the historical context of 18th-century Austria, where Mozart lived and worked.\n\nAs I traverse this conceptual graph, I identify promising directions for query expansion. One direction is to explore synonymous terms for \"musician\" and \"composer,\" which could include \"classical music artist\" or \"18th-century composer.\" Another direction is to look at hierarchical terms, such as \"Austrian composer\" or \"baroque music composer,\" although the latter might not be entirely accurate since Mozart is more closely associated with the classical period.\n\nConsidering compositional terms, I might look at parts of Mozart's compositions, like \"symphonies,\" \"operas,\" or \"concertos.\" Contextual terms could involve the settings in which Mozart's music was performed, such as \"Viennese opera houses\" or \"European royal courts.\" Lastly, domain-specific terminology could include musical terms like \"sonata form\" or \"opus numbers.\"\n\nExtracting and filtering terms based on relevance, distinctiveness, specificity, and searchability, I come up with a list of high-value expansion terms. These include \"classical music,\" \"composer,\" \"Austrian,\" \"18th century,\" \"symphonies,\" \"operas,\" and \"Viennese opera.\" These terms maintain the original search intent of finding information about Mozart while correcting the factual error and providing a more nuanced and accurate query.\n\nApplying these expansion terms to the original query, I formulate an augmented query: \"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart musician composer classical music.\" This query captures the essence of Mozart's profession and contributions to music, offering a clear and factual basis for retrieving relevant documents.\n\nThrough this process of applying the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal technique and exploring related threads, I believe the terms identified would be most effective for retrieving accurate and relevant information about Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. These terms not only correct the initial query's factual error but also provide a comprehensive approach to understanding Mozart's life, works, and historical context.",
