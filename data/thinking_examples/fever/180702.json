  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query \"Cary Elwes was born in April 1962,\" this makes me think of Cary Elwes as an actor, though the user might actually be trying to find more specific information about his early life or career. The query seems to be too broad and could potentially yield results about other individuals with the same name. I need to refine the search to focus on his unique attributes and life stages, going beyond basic biographical details.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the top results provide a good overview of Cary Elwes' acting career, but they don't delve deeper into his early life, education, or transition into acting. The text snippets from the initial results show that Cary Elwes is an English actor and writer, known for his roles in various films and series, but they don't provide much information about his background or personal life.\n\nTo expand the query, I will use the technique of breadth and depth expansion. I start by identifying ineffective terms, such as \"was born,\" which don't add much value to the search. Then, I look for candidate terms that introduce new dimensions to the query, such as \"Theatre,\" \"Early Roles,\" \"Film School,\" \"British Acting,\" and \"London Theatre Scene.\" These terms seem to be related to Cary Elwes' career and background, but I need to go deeper to find more specific and relevant information.\n\nFollowing the expansion technique, I choose one distant but important topic from the breadth expansion, such as \"Royal Academy of Dramatic Art,\" and go increasingly deeper into related terms, such as \"Laurence Olivier,\" \"Classical Acting,\" \"Stage Debut,\" and \"West End Productions.\" These terms seem to be closely related to Cary Elwes' education and early career, and they might provide more specific and relevant results.\n\nAs I apply the technique, I notice that the terms are becoming more specific and targeted. I have a realization that connects to what we were exploring earlier - the importance of Cary Elwes' education and training in his acting career. I also consider the context of the original query and the user's potential intentions, and I adjust the expansion accordingly.\n\nThrough this process of applying the expansion technique and exploring related threads, I believe the terms that would be most effective for a search query are those that capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking. The augmented query \"Cary Elwes Theatre Royal Academy of Dramatic Art Laurence Olivier Classical Acting Stage Debut West End Productions\" seems to be a good representation of the user's intentions, and it should yield more specific and relevant results.",
