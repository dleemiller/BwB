  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query about Nate Diaz declining to compete in World Extreme Cagefighting, this makes me think of the complexities of fighter contracts and negotiations in the world of mixed martial arts. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the reasons behind Diaz's statement, the initial results are more focused on his career highlights and participation in various martial arts organizations without directly addressing his alleged refusal to compete in the WEC.\n\nAnalyzing the results, I notice that terms like \"compete,\" \"World Extreme Cagefighting,\" and \"Nate Diaz\" are not yielding the desired insights into the potential reasons or evidence supporting Diaz's claim. This suggests that these terms might be too broad or not precise enough for our query expansion. The text snippets provided, especially from the first two documents, offer valuable information about Nate Diaz's career and achievements but do not delve into the specifics of his interactions with the WEC regarding competition.\n\nTo approach this query expansion systematically, I'll utilize the technique of query augmentation, which involves identifying ineffective terms, performing breadth expansion to explore related concepts, and then applying depth expansion to dive deeper into a selected area. This technique should help in discovering new, relevant documents across various domains without overlapping with the original terms.\n\nStarting with the breadth expansion, terms like \"MMA contracts,\" \"fighter negotiations,\" \"WEC history,\" \"UFC vs WEC,\" and \"fighter management\" come to mind. These terms introduce new dimensions to the query by considering the broader context of martial arts organizations and the legal and managerial aspects of a fighter's career.\n\nFor depth expansion, I'm drawn to the topic of \"fighter contracts\" as it directly relates to the potential reasons behind Nate Diaz's decision. Drilling down into this topic, we have \"contract clauses,\" \"promotion exclusivity,\" \"salary disputes,\" and \"fighter walkouts\" as key areas of interest. These terms not only provide a deeper understanding of the contractual obligations and potential points of contention but also offer a framework for understanding the dynamics between fighters and martial arts organizations.\n\nApplying the query augmentation technique systematically, I first identify ineffective terms such as \"compete\" and \"World Extreme Cagefighting,\" which, while relevant to the original query, do not provide the specificity needed for our investigation. Then, through breadth expansion, I explore related concepts that might shed light on the situation, such as the historical context of the WEC, comparisons with the UFC, and the role of fighter management in decision-making processes.\n\nThe depth expansion into \"fighter contracts\" and related terms like \"contract clauses,\" \"salary disputes,\" and \"fighter walkouts\" reveals a nuanced picture of the potential reasons behind a fighter's decision to refuse competition. This systematic approach, combined with the organic connections made during the thought process, leads to a more refined understanding of the query's objectives and gaps.\n\nUpon reflection, the initial thought process and systematic application of the query augmentation technique have yielded insights that are both logically derived from the technique and intuitively connected to the broader context of martial arts and fighter contracts. The terms \"MMA contract clauses,\" \"fighter walkouts,\" and \"salary disputes\" emerge as particularly relevant, capturing both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking: evidence or reasons related to Nate Diaz's statement about declining to compete in the WEC.\n\nThrough this process of applying the query augmentation technique and exploring related threads, I believe the terms \"MMA contract clauses,\" \"fighter walkouts,\" and \"salary disputes\" would be most effective for further inquiry. They not only provide a clear direction for investigating the reasons behind Diaz's alleged refusal but also open up avenues for understanding the complex interplay between fighters, contracts, and martial arts organizations.",
