Book of Victory ) is a biography of Timur completed by the Persian historian Sharaf ad-Din Ali Yazdi somewhere between 1424 and 28 ( AH 828 -- 832 ) . It was commissioned by Ibrahim Sultan , Timur 's grandson , and remains one of the best-known sources on Timur 's life . Yazdi relied heavily on another biography of Timur , also called the Zafarnama , completed by Nizam ad-Din Shami in 1404 .

  "thought_process": "As I begin to expand the query about Timur, an Arabian lord, my initial impressions are that we're dealing with a historical figure of significant importance, particularly in the context of Central Asian history and the Mongol Empire's legacy. The mention of Timur immediately brings to mind concepts of conquest, empire building, and the blending of cultures. However, to truly capture the essence of what the user might be seeking, it's crucial to delve beyond the surface level of mere titles or roles like \"lord\" and explore the depths of his impact, strategies, and interactions with other rulers and societies.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, it's clear that there are strengths in the areas of historical biography, as evidenced by the mention of the Zafarnama, a biography of Timur, and the Timur Ruby, which highlights his legacy in the form of treasured artifacts passed down through generations of rulers. However, there's a weakness in terms of depth regarding his military tactics, innovations, and the specifics of his empire's administration and cultural influences.\n\nTo approach this query expansion systematically, I'll apply the technique of combining synonym replacement, conceptual expansion, and contextual expansion. This technique involves first identifying ineffective or overly broad terms that don't add much value to the search, such as \"lord\" and \"Arabian,\" which are too generic. Then, it's about expanding the query to include more specific and diverse terms that capture the breadth of Timur's historical significance, including his conquests, empire building strategies, and his impact on art, architecture, and religion.\n\nStarting with the breadth expansion, terms like \"conquests,\" \"empire building,\" \"diplomacy,\" \"art patronage,\" and \"architecture\" come to mind as they directly relate to the primary objectives of understanding Timur's impact on Central Asian culture and his interactions with other societies. For depth expansion, focusing on \"military tactics\" and related terms such as \"siege warfare,\" \"cannon technology,\" and \"logistics\" seems promising, as these aspects are crucial to understanding how Timur expanded and maintained his empire.\n\nAs I systematically apply these expansion techniques, I find that the process naturally leads to insights that combine both structured thinking and intuitive connections. For instance, considering Timur's military innovations leads me to think about the technological advancements during his time, such as cannon technology, which was pivotal in siege warfare. This, in turn, reminds me of the importance of logistics and army composition in his conquests, showing how each aspect of his empire building was interconnected.\n\nThe application of the expansion technique also leads to some reconsiderations. Initially, I thought to include terms related to his personal life, but upon further reflection, focusing on the broader impact and strategies of his empire seems more aligned with the query's objectives. There's also an interesting tangent regarding the cultural and artistic achievements under his rule, which could provide valuable insights into his legacy beyond military conquests.\n\nThrough this process of applying the expansion technique and exploring related threads, I believe the terms that would be most effective for a BM25 index are those that capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking. The augmented query, \"conquests empire building siege warfare cannon technology logistics army composition diplomacy art patronage architecture,\" reflects a balanced approach, combining the systematic application of the expansion technique with the natural flow of intuitive connections and insights.\n\nThis thought process not only adheres to the guidelines of being specific, diverse, and targeted but also ensures that the final terms are novel, free from overlapping the original query, and devoid of generic or ineffective words. The resulting augmented query is poised to uncover a wide range of relevant documents across various domains, offering a deeper understanding of Timur's historical significance and legacy.",
