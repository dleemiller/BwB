  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"Scream 2 is exclusively a German film,\" my initial impression is that this statement seems inaccurate because, from my general knowledge, the Scream franchise is associated with American films, particularly in the horror genre. This makes me think that the user might actually be trying to find information about the country of origin for the movie \"Scream 2,\" possibly due to confusion or a misunderstanding about the film's production background. The original query's focus on it being a \"German film\" might be a red herring or an incorrect assumption.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the top results are heavily skewed towards music-related information, likely due to the term \"Scream\" being associated with music, such as Ozzy Osbourne's album \"Scream\" or the song \"Scream & Shout\" by will.i.am and Britney Spears. This suggests that the query needs to be refined to explicitly link \"Scream 2\" to the film industry and to specify the desired geographic context, which is the country of production.\n\nTo approach this systematically, I'll use the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal technique. This involves identifying core concepts and entities in the query, determining the search intent, and listing any implicit assumptions or constraints. The core concepts here are \"Scream 2,\" \"film,\" and \"country of production.\" The search intent is informational, aiming to identify the country where \"Scream 2\" was produced. An implicit assumption might be that \"Scream 2\" is indeed a film and not just a title that could apply to other forms of media.\n\nNext, I construct a conceptual graph with core nodes for \"Scream 2,\" \"film,\" and \"country of production.\" First-order connections include properties like \"genre\" (horror), \"release year\" (1997), and \"directed by\" (Wes Craven). Second-order connections might involve related concepts like \"American film industry,\" given that Wes Craven is an American director and the film is part of a well-known American horror franchise.\n\nFor expansion path selection, promising directions include synonymous terms (e.g., \"movie\" instead of \"film\"), hierarchical terms (e.g., \"slasher film\" as a subgenre of horror), compositional terms (e.g., \"cast\" to include names of actors), contextual terms (e.g., \"Hollywood\" as a setting or industry), and domain-specific terminology (e.g., \"cinematography\" or \"screenplay\"). Given the task's goal, focusing on terms that directly relate to the film's production and geographic origin is crucial.\n\nApplying the technique and balancing structured steps with natural thought patterns, I consider how the film \"Scream 2\" is known to be part of American pop culture and how its production would likely be associated with the United States rather than Germany. This intuition complements the systematic approach, suggesting that expansion terms should aim to clarify the film's nationality and production context.\n\nThrough this process, insights emerge from both the structured technique and intuition. For instance, using the term \"American\" as an expansion term directly addresses the query's need for geographic context. Similarly, terms like \"Hollywood film\" or \"produced in the USA\" could enhance the query by specifying the production's location.\n\nSynthesizing these insights with clarity, I believe the most effective expansion terms for a query about \"Scream 2\" and its country of production would include terms that directly link the film to its correct geographic and industrial context. This means focusing on terms that clarify its association with the American film industry and specifying that the query is about a film, not music.\n\nThe final expanded query, considering both the technique and natural insights, should effectively capture the user's intent to find information about the country of origin for the movie \"Scream 2,\" correctly identifying it as an American film. This approach ensures that the search results will be more accurate and relevant, providing the user with the information they are seeking about the film's production background.",
