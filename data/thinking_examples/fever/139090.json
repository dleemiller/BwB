It took place on August 23 , 2015 , at Barclays Center in Brooklyn , New York . The twenty-eighth event under the SummerSlam chronology , this was the first since 2008 to be held outside of Los Angeles as Staples Center was the exclusive home for SummerSlam from 2009 to 2014 , and the eighth SummerSlam to be held in the New York metropolitan area . The Izod Center was originally supposed to host SummerSlam , but due to its closure in April 2015 , the event was moved to Barclays Center . The event was the first in the SummerSlam chronology to be four hours in length , a length previously reserved only for WrestleMania .   The event was the second night of what was billed as a `` triple-header '' at Barclays Center , with NXT TakeOver : Brooklyn having taken place the previous night , and Raw the following night . Ten matches were contested at the event , with no pre-show . In the main event , The Undertaker defeated Brock Lesnar in controversial fashion ; Lesnar put Undertaker in his Kimura lock and the timekeeper rang the bell after seeing the Undertaker supposedly indicating submission , but since the referee had n't seen a submission and never stopped the match , the match continued . The confusion allowed Undertaker to surprise Lesnar with a low blow before trapping him in the Hell 's Gate submission hold , during which Lesnar passed out to give Undertaker the win .\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: SummerSlam ( 1999 ) was the twelfth annual SummerSlam professional wrestling pay-per-view event produced by the World Wrestling Federation ( WWF ) .

  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query \"SummerSlam was a concert,\" this makes me think of a music event, though the user might actually be trying to find information about a professional wrestling event, given the common association of \"SummerSlam\" with WWE. Hmm, not sure yet, as the query explicitly mentions a concert, which seems contradictory to the typical context of SummerSlam. \n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, it's clear that the system misunderstood the intent, focusing on professional wrestling events rather than music concerts. This indicates a need to clarify the user's intent and focus on musical events. The existing reasoning suggests that to improve results, we need to emphasize the aspect of \"SummerSlam\" being related to music or concerts.\n\nThe task outcomes provide clear query goals: finding information about a music concert, identifying performers, and determining the date and location. This aligns with what I would expect from a query about a concert. The augmented query \"SummerSlam music concert\" OR \"SummerSlam live performance\" seems like a good starting point, as it directly addresses the need to focus on music-related aspects of SummerSlam.\n\nNow, let's approach this using the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal technique, which involves constructing a conceptual graph and traversing it to find high-value expansion terms. This should help because it systematically explores related concepts and entities, potentially uncovering terms that are relevant to the user's search for a music concert associated with SummerSlam.\n\nStarting with query analysis, the core concepts are \"SummerSlam\" and \"concert.\" The search intent is informational, aiming to find details about an event. An implicit assumption might be that SummerSlam could refer to a music event, contrary to its common association.\n\nFor graph construction, we have core nodes for \"SummerSlam\" and \"concert.\" First-order connections include types of concerts (music festival, live performance) and attributes (performers, date, location). Second-order connections might involve specific genres of music or venues known for hosting concerts. Domain contexts include music and entertainment.\n\nSelecting expansion paths, we consider synonymous terms (like \"live performance\" for \"concert\"), hierarchical terms (such as \"music festival\" as a broader concept), compositional terms (parts of a concert, like \"performers\"), and contextual terms (settings like \"outdoor concert\" or \"summer music event\").\n\nExtracting and filtering terms, we look for relevance, distinctiveness, specificity, and searchability. For example, terms like \"music festival,\" \"rock concert,\" and \"summer music event\" could be relevant and distinctive, offering specific pathways for retrieval without too much lexical overlap with the original query.\n\nThrough this process, insights emerge from both the structured technique and natural intuition. Applying the expansion technique leads to terms like \"live performance\" and \"music event,\" which connect well with the idea of a concert. My instinct also suggests considering terms related to the time of year (\"summer concert\") or the genre of music, given that SummerSlam is typically associated with a specific time frame.\n\nSynthesizing this information with clarity, I believe the terms that would be most effective for expanding the query are those that maintain the focus on music events while considering the unique aspects of SummerSlam. This includes terms like \"SummerSlam music concert,\" \"live performance,\" \"rock concert,\" and potentially \"summer music festival,\" depending on the specific intent behind the query.\n\nThe final expanded terms capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, balancing the structured approach of the query expansion technique with the natural cognitive patterns of considering related concepts and entities. This approach should yield a more accurate and relevant set of search results, aligning with the user's intent to find information about a music concert associated with SummerSlam.",
