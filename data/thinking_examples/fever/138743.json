  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: Personality is a set of individual differences that are affected by the development of an individual : values , attitudes , personal memories , social relationships , habits , and skills . Different personality theorists present their own definitions of the word based on their theoretical positions . The term `` personality trait '' refers to enduring personal characteristics that are revealed in a particular pattern of behaviour in a variety of situations .\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n... This led Adam & Breithaupt-Peters ( 2010 ) to the idea that these children and adolescents need to be looked at more carefully . The therapy which these children and adolescents need might be more intense and maybe even different from looking at the disorders traditionally . The concept of personality development disorders also focuses on the severity of the disorder and the poor prognosis . An early diagnosis might help to get the right treatment at an early stage and thus might help to prevent a personality disorder outcome in adulthood .\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: Affective memory was an early element of Stanislavski 's ` system ' and a central part of method acting . Affective memory requires actors to call on the memory of details from a similar situation ( or more recently a situation with similar emotions ) and import those feelings to those of their characters . Stanislavski believed actors needed to take emotion and personality to the stage and call upon it when playing their character . He also explored the use of objectives , actioning , and empathizing with the character .   `` Emotional recall '' is the basis for Lee Strasberg 's Method acting . `` Sense memory '' is used to refer to the recall of physical sensations surrounding emotional events ( instead of the emotions themselves ) . The use of affective memory remains a controversial topic in acting theory . Otherwise known as emotional memory , it is often used by making the actors completely relax so that they recall the memory better .\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"Personality is unaffected by the development of personal memories,\" this makes me think of the complexities of human development and how memories, both significant and mundane, contribute to the formation of our personalities. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the interplay between memory and personality, it seems there's an underlying assumption that personal memories play a minimal role in shaping who we are. Hmm, not sure yet, but this query touches on deep psychological and sociological concepts.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the existing reasoning primarily focuses on broad personality theories rather than directly addressing the relationship between memory and personality formation. The text snippets from the initial results provide some insights, particularly the first snippet, which mentions personal memories among other factors that affect personality. However, it's clear that we need to refine the query to delve deeper into the specifics of how personal memories influence personality development.\n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here, but let me approach this using the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal technique, which involves constructing a conceptual graph and traversing it to find high-value expansion terms. This should help because it allows us to systematically explore the semantic space around our query, identifying key concepts, relationships, and terms that can enhance our search.\n\nFollowing the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal approach, I should first identify the core concepts and entities in the original query. Here, the core concepts are \"personality development,\" \"personal memories,\" and their interrelation. The search intent is informational, aiming to understand a specific aspect of human psychology. Implicit assumptions include the belief that personal memories have a role in personality development, contrary to the query's statement.\n\nNext, I construct a conceptual graph with core nodes representing \"personality,\" \"memories,\" and \"development.\" First-order connections include aspects like \"self-concept,\" \"emotional regulation,\" and \"identity formation,\" which are directly related to personality development. Second-order connections bring in concepts such as \"childhood experiences,\" \"traumatic events,\" and \"social relationships,\" which influence both personal memories and personality. Domain contexts involve psychology, sociology, and possibly neuroscience.\n\nFor expansion path selection, I identify promising directions such as synonymous terms (e.g., \"character traits\" for \"personality\"), hierarchical terms (broader concepts like \"psychological development\" or narrower ones like \"adolescent personality formation\"), compositional terms (parts of personality like \"cognitive\" or \"emotional intelligence\"), contextual terms (settings where personality develops, such as \"family\" or \"school\"), and domain-specific terminology (\"personality traits,\" \"memory consolidation\").\n\nExtracting and filtering terms, I consider relevance, distinctiveness, specificity, and searchability. Terms like \"self-concept,\" \"emotional memory,\" \"identity formation,\" and \"social learning\" emerge as high-value expansion terms because they are semantically connected to the original query, offer new pathways for retrieval, and are likely to appear in relevant documents.\n\nThrough this process of applying Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal and exploring related threads, I believe the terms that would be most effective for expanding the query are those that capture the nuances of personality development and the role of personal memories. Terms such as \"self-concept,\" \"emotional regulation,\" \"identity formation,\" \"childhood experiences,\" \"traumatic events,\" and \"social relationships\" provide a rich semantic landscape that can lead to more targeted and informative search results.\n\nSynthesizing with clarity, the augmented query that emerges from this thought process is: \"Personality development and the role of personal memories in shaping self-concept, emotional regulation, and identity formation.\" This query maintains the original search intent while incorporating valuable expansion terms that should enhance document retrieval by focusing on specific aspects of personality development influenced by personal memories.",
