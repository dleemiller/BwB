  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n... Designed to provide a complete overview of English law , the four-volume treatise was repeatedly republished in 1770 , 1773 , 1774 , 1775 , 1778 and in a posthumous edition in 1783 . Reprints of the first edition , intended for practical use rather than antiquary interest , were published until the 1870s in England and Wales , and a working version by Henry John Stephen , first published in 1841 , was reprinted until after the Second World War . Legal education in England had stalled ; Blackstone 's work gave the law `` at least a veneer of scholarly respectability '' . William Searle Holdsworth , one of Blackstone 's successors as Vinerian Professor , argued that `` If the Commentaries had not been written when they were written , I think it very doubtful that -LSB- the United States -RSB- , and other English speaking countries would have so universally adopted the common law . '' In the United States , the Commentaries influenced Alexander Hamilton , John Marshall , James Wilson , John Jay , John Adams , James Kent and Abraham Lincoln , and remain frequently cited in Supreme Court decisions .\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n... Seeing the success of this publication , Blackstone was induced to write An Analysis of the Laws of England , a 200-page introduction to English law , which was first published in 1756 by the Clarendon Press .   Analysis begins with a summary of the ways that English law had been subdivided until that time . Blackstone examined the methods of Ranulf de Glanvill , Henry de Bracton and Matthew Hale , concluding that Hale 's method was superior to the others . As such , Hale 's distribution `` hath therefore been principally followed '' -LSB- by Blackstone in An Analysis . . -RSB- , albeit with some amendments . The treatise is `` a marked advance on any previous introduction to English law . . including constitutional , civil and criminal law , public and private law , substantive law and procedure , as well as some introductory jurisprudential content '' . ...\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: Richard Saltonstall Greenough ( April 19 , 1819 -- 1904 ) was an American sculptor and younger brother to Neoclassical sculptor Horatio Greenough .   Greenough was born in Boston , Massachusetts , the youngest child of Elizabeth ( Bender ) and David Greenough ( 1774 -- 1836 ) . He was educated at the Boston Latin School , entering in 1829 . At age 17 , he followed his brother in a career in sculpture , and in 1837 left for Italy where he belonged to the second generation of American expatriate artists . Thereafter he divided his time between Europe and America , but spent most of his studio life in Rome . Greenough married Sarah Dana Loring of Boston on September 26 , 1846 . He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1855 . Greenough died in Rome in 1904 . He is buried in the Protestant Cemetery , Rome .   Greenough 's best-known work is probably a statue of Benjamin Franklin which stood in front of the Old City Hall ( Boston ) . The statue on Boston 's Freedom Trail , fell from its ten-foot pedestal in the early summer of 2016 , but sustained almost no damage and is currently being repaired .\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"William Blackstone was born in Boston,\" my initial impression is that this is a straightforward biographical query about a prominent figure in legal history. However, as I delve deeper, I realize that the user might actually be trying to understand the significance of Blackstone's birthplace in the context of his contributions to English common law. I'm not sure yet how to approach this, but I'm considering the historical context of Blackstone's life and work.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the top results focus on Blackstone's treatise, \"Commentaries on the Laws of England,\" and its influence on American law. This suggests that the query is not just about Blackstone's biography but also about his impact on the development of common law. The results also highlight the importance of understanding the historical context of Blackstone's work, including the Enlightenment philosophy and the writings of John Locke.\n\nTo expand the query, I'll use the Temporal Evolution Analysis technique, which involves analyzing how the query topic has evolved through time and will likely develop in the future. This technique will help me discover temporally diverse terminology and provide a more comprehensive understanding of Blackstone's influence on English common law.\n\nStarting with the historical foundation, I trace the origins of English common law and identify foundational concepts such as natural law theory, English common law, and legal positivism. I note that Blackstone's work was influenced by the writings of John Locke and the Enlightenment philosophy. Moving on to the developmental milestones, I map the key evolutionary stages in the development of English common law, including the publication of Blackstone's \"Commentaries\" and the rise of legal professionalism.\n\nAs I transition to the current landscape, I assess the contemporary state of English common law and identify current best practices and leading approaches. I note that the terminology used by today's practitioners and experts includes concepts such as access to justice, legal ethics, and judicial activism vs. judicial restraint. Finally, I project how English common law is likely to evolve in the future, identifying emerging trends such as the impact of technology on law, human rights in a globalized world, and environmental law.\n\nThroughout this process, I'm applying the Temporal Evolution Analysis technique systematically, but I'm also allowing for natural thought patterns to emerge. I'm making connections between different concepts and ideas, and I'm considering how they relate to each other. For example, I realize that Blackstone's influence on American law is not just limited to the 18th century but continues to be felt today, with his ideas shaping contemporary debates on judicial activism and legal ethics.\n\nAs I synthesize my thoughts, I believe that the expanded query should include terms such as \"evolution of English common law,\" \"William Blackstone's influence on American law,\" and \"emerging trends in legal scholarship.\" These terms capture the temporal evolution of Blackstone's ideas and their continued relevance in contemporary legal discourse. Through this process of applying the Temporal Evolution Analysis technique and exploring related threads, I've gained a deeper understanding of the complex and nuanced nature of Blackstone's contributions to English common law.",
