Of his three older brothers , two would live long enough to ascend the French throne , but both died young and without a legitimate male heir . He abandoned Commonwealth upon receiving word that he had inherited the throne of France at the age of 22 .   The kingdom of France was at the time plagued by the Wars of Religion , and Henry 's authority was undermined by violent political parties funded by foreign powers : the Catholic League ( supported by Spain ) , the Protestant Huguenots ( supported by England and the Dutch ) and the Malcontents , led by Henry 's own brother , the Duke of Alen\u00e7on , which was a party of Catholic and Protestant aristocrats who jointly opposed the absolutist ambitions of the king . Henry III was himself a politique , arguing that a strong and religiously tolerant monarchy would save France from collapse .   After the death of Henry 's younger brother Francis , Duke of Anjou , and when it became apparent that Henry would not produce an heir , the Wars of Religion grew into a succession crisis that resulted in a war known as the War of the Three Henrys . Henry III 's legitimate heir was his distant cousin Henry , King of Navarre , a Protestant . ...\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: Antoine ( in English , Anthony ; 22 April 1518 -- 17 November 1562 ) was the King of Navarre through his marriage ( jure uxoris ) to Queen Jeanne III , from 1555 until his death . He was the first monarch of the House of Bourbon , of which he was head from 1537 . He was the father of Henry IV of France .\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: Henry IV ( 15 April 1367 -- 20 March 1413 ) , also known as Henry of Bolingbroke ( -LSB- \u02c8b\u0252l\u026a\u014bbr\u028ak -RSB- ) , was King of England and Lord of Ireland from 1399 to 1413 , and asserted the claim of his grandfather , Edward III , to the Kingdom of France .   Henry was born at Bolingbroke Castle in Lincolnshire . His father , John of Gaunt , was the fourth son of Edward III and the third son to survive to adulthood , and enjoyed a position of considerable influence during much of the reign of Henry 's cousin Richard II , whom Henry eventually deposed . Henry 's mother was Blanche , heiress to the considerable Lancaster estates , and thus he became the first King of England from the Lancaster branch of the Plantagenets and the first King of England since the Norman Conquest whose mother tongue was English rather than French .\n",
  "thought_process": "As I begin to analyze the original query, \"Henry III of France was succeeded by the first French king of the House of Bourbon,\" my initial impression is that the user is looking for a straightforward answer to who succeeded Henry III. However, upon closer examination, I realize that the query lacks specificity and context. The user might be trying to understand the historical context surrounding the succession or the significance of the House of Bourbon in French history. \n\nLooking at the initial results, I notice that they provide a wealth of information about Henry III, the Wars of Religion, and the succession crisis, but they are lengthy and lack conciseness. The results from k=1 and k=2 are particularly useful, as they provide insight into the Wars of Religion and the role of the House of Bourbon. The snippet from k=10, however, seems less relevant, as it discusses Henry IV of England rather than Henry IV of France.\n\nTo improve the query, I decide to apply the expansion technique, focusing on targeted expansions that introduce new dimensions to the query. I start by identifying the primary objectives and gaps in the original query. The main goal is to identify the successor of Henry III, but the query lacks specificity and context.\n\nNext, I identify ineffective terms that should be avoided. The phrase \"was succeeded by\" is too broad and doesn't add much value to the query. I also notice that the original query doesn't explicitly state the successor, which is Henry IV.\n\nFor breadth expansion, I consider terms that are increasingly distant from the original query. I look at concepts related to the French monarchy, the House of Valois, the Wars of Religion, and Cardinal Richelieu. These terms provide a broader context for the succession of Henry III and the rise of the House of Bourbon.\n\nFor depth expansion, I choose to focus on the House of Bourbon and explore related terms in more depth. I consider terms like King Henry IV, the Edict of Nantes, Religious Toleration, and Huguenots. These terms provide a more nuanced understanding of the historical context surrounding the succession and the significance of the House of Bourbon.\n\nAs I apply the expansion technique, I start to see connections between the different terms and concepts. The Edict of Nantes, for example, was a significant event in the reign of Henry IV, and it's closely related to the concept of Religious Toleration. The Huguenots, a Protestant group, played a crucial role in the Wars of Religion and the succession crisis.\n\nThrough this process, I begin to see a clearer picture of the historical context surrounding the succession of Henry III. The terms that emerge from the expansion technique \u2013 King Henry IV, Edict of Nantes, Religious Toleration, and Huguenots \u2013 provide a concise and focused answer to the original query. They capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, including the successor of Henry III and the historical context surrounding the succession.\n\nIn synthesizing the results, I realize that the augmented query should include these high-quality search terms, omitting ineffective words and ensuring uniqueness, diversity, and relevance. The final augmented query, \"king henry iv edict nantes religious toleration huguenots,\" effectively balances structure and intuition, providing a novel and targeted expansion of the original query.",
