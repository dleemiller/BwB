  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: The Elephant Man is a 1980 American historical drama film about Joseph Merrick ( whom the script calls John Merrick ) , a severely deformed man in late 19th century London . The film was directed by David Lynch and stars John Hurt , Anthony Hopkins , Anne Bancroft , John Gielgud , Wendy Hiller , Michael Elphick , Hannah Gordon and Freddie Jones . It was produced by Jonathan Sanger and Mel Brooks , the latter of whom was intentionally left uncredited to avoid confusion from audiences who possibly would have expected a comedy .   The screenplay was adapted by Lynch , Christopher De Vore and Eric Bergren from Frederick Treves 's The Elephant Man and Other Reminiscences ( 1923 ) and Ashley Montagu 's The Elephant Man : A Study in Human Dignity ( 1971 ) . It was shot in black-and-white and featured make-up work by Christopher Tucker .   The Elephant Man was a critical and commercial success with eight Academy Award nominations , including Best Picture , Best Director , Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Actor . After receiving widespread criticism for failing to honor the film 's make-up effects , the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences was prompted to create the Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling the following year . The film also won the BAFTA Awards for Best Film , Best Actor and Best Production Design and was nominated for Golden Globe awards . It also won a French C\u00e9sar Award for Best Foreign Film .\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n... Although the official cause of his death was asphyxia , Treves , who performed the autopsy on the body , said that Merrick had died of a dislocated neck . He believed that Merrick , who had to sleep sitting up because of the weight of his head , had been attempting to sleep lying down to `` be like other people '' . In absence of the possibility of genetic tests , the exact cause of Merrick 's deformities has long been unclear , so that throughout much of the 20th century it was speculated that Merrick was affected by other neurological syndromes . Only in 1986 was it conjectured that he had Proteus syndrome , a very rare congenital disorder also known as Wiedemann syndrome ( named after the German pediatrician Hans-Rudolf Wiedemann ) . DNA tests on his hair and bones in 2003 in a study by Charis Eng were inconclusive . Meanwhile , in 1979 , Bernard Pomerance 's play about Merrick called The Elephant Man debuted , and David Lynch 's film , also called The Elephant Man , was released in 1980 . In late 2014 and early 2015 , Bradley Cooper starred in a Broadway revival of The Elephant Man , directed by Scott Ellis .\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: Joseph : King of Dreams is a 2000 American animated biblical musical drama film and the only direct-to-video release from DreamWorks Animation . The film is an adaptation of the story of Joseph from the Book of Genesis in the Bible and serves as a prequel to the 1998 film The Prince of Egypt . Composer Daniel Pelfrey said `` the film was designed as a companion piece to Prince of Egypt ... Of course , Joseph turned out to be very different than Prince of Egypt , -LSB- nevertheless -RSB- very challenging and rewarding '' .   Co-director Robert Ramirez has said that whilst the reviews for the film had `` generally been very good '' there was a period `` when the film was not working very well , when the storytelling was heavy-handed '' and `` klunky '' .\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"Joseph Merrick's was the subject of a historical drama,\" this makes me think of the various adaptations and portrayals of his life in film and theatre. Though the user might actually be trying to find information on the historical context of his life, the mention of \"drama\" suggests a focus on performances. Hmm, not sure yet, but I'm inclined to explore the theatrical and cinematic aspects of Joseph Merrick's story.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that while we get a lot of information about Joseph Merrick's biography and related topics, there's a lack of focus on the specific dramatic adaptations. The top results provide a good starting point, with mentions of \"The Elephant Man\" film and play, but we need to dig deeper to uncover more relevant information.\n\nTo approach this systematically, I'll use the Conceptual Graph Traversal technique, which involves constructing a graph of concepts and traversing it to find high-value expansion terms. This technique should help because it allows us to identify semantic relationships between entities and concepts, which can lead to more precise and relevant search terms.\n\nFirst, I identify the core concepts and entities in the original query: Joseph Merrick and historical drama. The search intent seems to be informational, with the user looking for details about dramatic adaptations of Merrick's life. There's an implicit assumption that the user is interested in film and theatre productions.\n\nNext, I construct a conceptual graph with core nodes (Joseph Merrick, historical drama), first-order connections (film, play, adaptation), and second-order connections (actors, directors, awards). Domain contexts include film studies, theatre history, and biography.\n\nNow, I select promising directions for query expansion. I'll consider synonymous terms (e.g., \"biographical drama\" instead of \"historical drama\"), hierarchical terms (e.g., \"period drama\" or \"Victorian-era drama\"), compositional terms (e.g., \"film adaptation\" or \"stage play\"), and contextual terms (e.g., \"London theatre\" or \"19th-century drama\").\n\nAs I traverse the graph, I extract high-value terms and filter them based on relevance, distinctiveness, specificity, and searchability. I notice that terms like \"The Elephant Man,\" \"David Lynch,\" and \"John Hurt\" are highly relevant, but I also want to consider other actors, directors, and productions that might be associated with Joseph Merrick's story.\n\nFollowing the technique, I should first identify synonymous terms... Wait, that's not quite right for this query. Let me adjust my approach to focus on the cinematic and theatrical aspects. This step of the technique is revealing the importance of \"The Elephant Man\" as a central concept... which actually reminds me of the play by Bernard Pomerance and the film by David Lynch.\n\nI need to consider the next step in the technique, which involves analyzing the relationships between concepts, but I'm also noticing an interesting pattern where the query results often mention awards and accolades associated with these productions. This might be a useful tangent to explore, as it could provide additional context and relevance to the search terms.\n\nApplying the specific aspect of the technique related to domain-specific terminology leads me to discover terms like \"Proteus syndrome,\" which is a rare congenital disorder associated with Joseph Merrick's condition. This could be a valuable addition to the query, as it provides a precise and relevant aspect of his story.\n\nI just had a realization that connects to what we were exploring earlier: the importance of considering the historical context of Joseph Merrick's life and how it has been portrayed in different dramas. Following the technique pointed me toward \"The Elephant Man\" as a crucial concept, but my instinct says we should also consider other adaptations and interpretations of his story.\n\nThrough this process of applying Conceptual Graph Traversal and exploring related threads, I believe the terms \"historical dramas,\" \"Joseph Merrick,\" \"film adaptations,\" \"The Elephant Man,\" and \"biographical drama\" would be most effective for a BM25 index. They capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, including the focus on dramatic adaptations and the historical context of Joseph Merrick's life.",
