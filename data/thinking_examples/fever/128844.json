The United States , European Union , and other nations are currently scanning for NEOs in an effort called Spaceguard .   In the United States and since 1998 , NASA has a congressional mandate to catalogue all NEOs that are at least 1 kilometer wide , as the impact of such an object would be globally catastrophic . In 2006 , it was estimated that 20 % of the mandated objects had not yet been found . In 2011 , largely as a result of NEOWISE , it was estimated that 93 % of the NEAs larger than 1 km had been found and that only about 70 remained to be discovered . , there have been 875 NEAs larger than 1 km discovered , of which 157 are potentially hazardous . The inventory is much less complete for smaller objects , which still have potential for large scale , though not global , damage .   Potentially hazardous objects ( PHOs ) are currently defined based on parameters that measure the object 's potential to make threatening close approaches to the Earth . Mostly objects with an Earth minimum orbit intersection distance ( MOID ) of 0.05 AU or less and an absolute magnitude ( H ) of 22.0 or brighter ( a rough indicator of large size ) are considered PHOs .

  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"A near-Earth object is not a solar body,\" this makes me think of the distinctions between various celestial entities and how they are classified. Though the user might actually be trying to understand why near-Earth objects (NEOs) are categorized differently from solar bodies, it seems there's an underlying quest for definition and comparison. Hmm, not sure yet, but it appears we're dealing with a mix of astronomy and the classification of celestial objects.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, the text snippets provided from different document positions offer insights into the characteristics of NEOs and their differences from solar bodies. For instance, the first snippet highlights the potential danger of near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) and the efforts to catalogue them, emphasizing their size and orbit as critical factors. This suggests that the definitions of NEOs and solar bodies might hinge on their orbital patterns, size, and potential impact on Earth. The mention of NASA's mandate and the concept of potentially hazardous objects (PHOs) further underscores the importance of understanding these distinctions for safety and astronomical research purposes.\n\nHowever, the initial results also show some weaknesses in directly addressing the query's intent. The information is rich in details about NEOs but doesn't explicitly compare them to solar bodies in a way that clarifies their differences. This indicates a need for a more structured approach to expand the query and capture the essence of what the user is seeking.\n\nLet me approach this using the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal technique, which involves constructing a conceptual graph and traversing it to find high-value expansion terms. This should help because it systematically identifies core concepts, their relationships, and related terms that can enhance the search query.\n\nStarting with query analysis, the core concepts are \"near-Earth object\" and \"solar body.\" The search intent is informational, aiming to understand the classification and differences between these entities. Implicit assumptions include the idea that there are distinct characteristics that set NEOs apart from solar bodies.\n\nConstructing the conceptual graph, we have core nodes for \"near-Earth object\" and \"solar body,\" with first-order connections including their definitions, orbital patterns, and sizes. Second-order connections might involve related concepts like asteroids, comets, and planets, which are also classified as celestial objects but have different properties. Domain contexts include astronomy and space research.\n\nFor expansion path selection, promising directions include synonymous terms (like \"asteroid\" for near-Earth object), hierarchical terms (broader concepts like \"celestial body\" or narrower ones like \"potentially hazardous asteroid\"), compositional terms (parts of NEOs like their composition or orbit), and contextual terms (settings where NEOs are studied, such as space missions).\n\nApplying the technique, I notice that terms like \"asteroid,\" \"comet,\" and \"planet\" are closely related to NEOs and could serve as expansion terms. However, to maintain the original search intent, we need to ensure these terms are used in a context that compares or contrasts NEOs with solar bodies. This leads to the consideration of terms like \"definition,\" \"characteristics,\" \"orbit,\" and \"composition\" as crucial for understanding the distinctions between these celestial entities.\n\nFollowing the technique's steps systematically, but also allowing for natural cognitive elements to influence the process, I find myself occasionally reconsidering the importance of certain terms. For example, the term \"solar system\" might seem relevant at first but could broaden the search too much, potentially diluting the focus on NEOs versus solar bodies. Intuitive connections, such as recognizing that the study of NEOs often involves understanding their potential impact on Earth, suggest that terms related to \"astronomical risks\" or \"space safety\" could also be pertinent.\n\nAs I step back to reassess, it becomes clear that the expansion terms should not only include synonyms and related concepts but also terms that explicitly address the comparison or contrast between NEOs and solar bodies. This realization leads to the inclusion of terms like \"distinguish,\" \"compare,\" and \"difference\" in the expanded query, ensuring that the search results will directly address the user's underlying question.\n\nThrough this process of applying the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal technique and exploring related threads, I believe the terms that would be most effective for expanding the query are those that capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking. These include terms that define NEOs and solar bodies, outline their characteristics, and explicitly compare or contrast them.\n\nThe final expanded query, considering the insights gained from both the structured technique and natural thought patterns, could look something like: \"near-Earth object AND NOT solar body, define asteroid, explain NEO composition and orbit, compare to solar body characteristics.\" This query aims to maintain the original intent while providing a clearer pathway for document retrieval systems to fetch relevant information about the distinctions between near-Earth objects and solar bodies.",
