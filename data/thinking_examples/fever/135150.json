  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"Kung Fu Panda was released on stage,\" this makes me think of theatrical productions, but the user might actually be trying to find information about a stage adaptation of the film. Hmm, not sure yet, but it seems like we're dealing with a mix of concepts from the film industry and theater. The existing reasoning suggests that we need to focus on terms related to theater, performance, and live adaptations to improve retrieval.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that they primarily focus on the film franchise, with documents discussing the production, cast, and reception of the movies. However, there's no mention of stage productions or adaptations, which indicates a significant gap in the search results. The initial results provide valuable context about the film, its production, and its narrative, but they don't address the user's implied interest in a stage adaptation.\n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here... Let me approach this using the Conceptual Graph Traversal technique, which involves constructing a graph of concepts and relationships to find relevant expansion terms. This should help because it allows me to systematically explore the semantic space around the original query.\n\nFirst, I identify the core concepts: \"Kung Fu Panda,\" \"stage,\" and \"release.\" Then, I determine the search intent, which seems to be informational, aiming to find details about a potential stage production of Kung Fu Panda. The implicit assumption here is that such a production exists or is conceivable.\n\nTo construct the conceptual graph, I start with core nodes representing the main entities (Kung Fu Panda, stage, release) and then add first-order connections (e.g., film, animation, theater, performance). Second-order connections might include related concepts like Broadway, musicals, or playwrights. Domain contexts could involve the entertainment industry, specifically film and theater production.\n\nFor expansion path selection, I consider synonymous terms (e.g., \"theater\" instead of \"stage\"), hierarchical terms (like \"performing arts\" as a broader concept), compositional terms (parts of a stage production, such as \"cast\" or \"crew\"), contextual terms (settings like \"Broadway\" or \"West End\"), and domain-specific terminology (e.g., \"adaptation\" or \"musical\").\n\nFollowing the Conceptual Graph Traversal approach, I should first extract high-value terms for each expansion path and then filter them based on relevance, distinctiveness, specificity, and searchability. For example, terms like \"Broadway musical,\" \"stage adaptation,\" \"theatrical production,\" and \"live performance\" seem highly relevant and could significantly improve the search results.\n\nApplying the technique leads me to discover terms like \"musical theater,\" \"play adaptation,\" and \"live show,\" which are closely related to the concept of a stage production of Kung Fu Panda. This realization connects to what we were exploring earlier regarding the need for terms that capture the essence of both the film and the theater context.\n\nThrough this process of applying Conceptual Graph Traversal and exploring related threads, I believe terms such as \"Kung Fu Panda stage production,\" \"Broadway musical,\" \"theatrical adaptation,\" and \"live performance\" would be most effective for improving retrieval. They capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, providing a balanced approach to query expansion.\n\nThe final step is synthesizing these insights into a coherent thought process that justifies the selection of the augmented query terms. By combining structured technique with natural cognitive patterns, I've been able to enhance the original query in a way that should yield more relevant results for the user.",
