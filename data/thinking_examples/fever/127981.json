  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query \"Zoe Saldana was born on June 19,\" my first impression is that this query is quite specific, aiming to pinpoint Zoe Saldana's exact birthdate. However, the existing results, while accurately identifying her as an actress, fail to provide the specific date requested. This suggests a need to refine the search beyond general biographical information and focus on sources that explicitly list birthdates.\n\nUpon analyzing the results, I notice that terms like \"actress,\" \"career,\" \"films,\" and \"roles\" are not effective in yielding the desired information. They are too broad and do not directly relate to the query's objective of finding Zoe Saldana's birthdate. Therefore, I identify these as ineffective terms that should be avoided in the expanded query.\n\nTo approach this query expansion, I will use a structured technique that involves breadth expansion and depth chaining. First, I consider broader concepts related to the query, such as \"celebrity birthdays,\" \"actors born in June,\" \"birth records database,\" and \"online biographical archives.\" These terms will help in finding more relevant documents that might contain Zoe Saldana's birthdate.\n\nNext, I apply depth chaining by selecting a distant but important topic from the breadth expansion and then going deeper into related terms. For instance, starting with \"birth records,\" I can move to \"June births,\" then to \"1978 births\" (since Zoe Saldana was born in 1978), and finally to \"Puerto Rican birth records,\" given that Zoe Saldana has Puerto Rican ancestry.\n\nAs I systematically apply these steps, I also allow for natural cognitive patterns to emerge. I notice that focusing on \"birth records\" and specifically \"June 19\" along with \"Puerto Rico\" could yield very targeted results. My intuition also suggests that including the year of birth, \"1978,\" might be beneficial, even though the original query does not specify the year. However, since the goal is to find the exact birthdate and considering the final expanded query should be novel and without overlapping the original terms, I decide to focus on the location and the date.\n\nThrough this process of applying the expansion technique and exploring related threads, I realize that terms like \"Zoe Saldana birth records June 19 Puerto Rico\" would be highly effective for finding her exact birthdate. These terms capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, combining the specificity of the date and location with the relevance of birth records.\n\nThus, by balancing structured technique with natural thought patterns, I arrive at an expanded query that is both novel and targeted towards finding Zoe Saldana's birthdate. This approach not only enhances the search query but also demonstrates how experts use a combination of systematic methods and intuitive insights to refine search queries effectively.",
