  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: This paper describes a new language resource of events and semantic roles that characterize real-world situations. Narrative schemas contain sets of related events (edit and publish), a temporal ordering of the events (edit before publish), and the semantic roles of the participants (authors publish books). This type of world knowledge was central to early research in natural language understanding. Scripts were one of the main formalisms, representing common sequences of events that occur in the world. Unfortunately, most of this knowledge was hand-coded and time consuming to create. Current machine learning techniques, as well as a new approach to learning through coreference chains, has allowed us to automatically extract rich event structure from open domain text in the form of narrative schemas. The narrative schema resource described in this paper contains approximately 5000 unique events combined into schemas of varying sizes. We describe the resource, how it is learned, and a new evaluation of the coverage of these schemas over unseen documents.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: OBJECTIVEInformal caregivers often experience psychological distress due to the changing functioning of the person with dementia they care for. Improved understanding of the person with dementia reduces psychological distress. To enhance understanding and empathy in caregivers, an innovative technology virtual reality intervention Through the D'mentia Lens (TDL) was developed to experience dementia, consisting of a virtual reality simulation movie and e-course. A pilot study of TDL was conducted.\n\n\nMETHODSA pre-test-post-test design was used. Informal caregivers filled out questionnaires assessing person-centeredness, empathy, perceived pressure from informal care, perceived competence and quality of the relationship. At post-test, additional questions about TDL's feasibility were asked.\n\n\nRESULTSThirty-five caregivers completed the pre-test and post-test. Most participants were satisfied with TDL and stated that TDL gave more insight in the perception of the person with dementia. The simulation movie was graded 8.03 out of 10 and the e-course 7.66. Participants significantly improved in empathy, confidence in caring for the person with dementia, and positive interactions with the person with dementia.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONTDL is feasible for informal caregivers and seems to lead to understanding of and insight in the experience of people with dementia. Therefore, TDL could support informal caregivers in their caregiving role.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: We report on a four year academic research project to build a natural language processing platform in support of a large media company. The Computable News platform processes news stories, producing a layer of structured data that can be used to build rich applications. We describe the underlying platform and the research tasks that we explored building it. The platform supports a wide range of prototype applications designed to support different newsroom functions. We hope that this qualitative review provides some insight into the challenges involved in this type of project.\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"Bank distress in the news: Describing events through deep learning,\" this makes me think of how news narratives and financial data integration could enhance predictive power for bank stress scenarios. The user likely seeks understanding of methodologies, challenges, and real-world applications of such systems. However, I'm not entirely sure what specific aspects they're interested in, so let's break it down.\n\nAnalyzing the existing reasoning provided, the query focuses on applying deep learning to analyze bank distress events through news and financial data integration. Key insights highlight two main approaches: one using advanced ML models with regulatory metrics and another leveraging financial news analysis via techniques like Doc2Vec embeddings. This tells me that the user is looking for a comprehensive understanding of how news and financial data can be combined for predictive modeling of bank distress.\n\nNow, let's apply the journalistic investigation technique for query expansion. The first step is query assessment, where we identify what the user is truly seeking beneath the surface query. It seems the user wants to understand the methodologies and applications of deep learning in analyzing bank distress through news and financial data. The next step involves identifying diverse real-world scenarios where this query is relevant, such as professional contexts in the financial sector, educational settings for finance and economics students, and personal situations for investors.\n\nMoving to the resource investigation step, we need to identify real, authoritative sources of information on this topic. This includes notable experts in financial analysis and deep learning, established methodologies like Doc2Vec and Random Forest, and essential terminology such as \"textual risk markers\" and \"regulatory buffers.\" Organizations like the Federal Reserve and financial institutions could provide valuable insights.\n\nFor the headline creation step, let's come up with diverse headlines that could introduce articles addressing the query from multiple angles. For example, \"Breaking Down Bank Stress Signals: How Deep Learning Decodes News Cycles and Financial Metrics\" or \"Deep Learning's News Edge: Predictive Power of Media Narratives in Banking Sector Stability.\" These headlines give us a starting point for extracting specific terms related to the query.\n\nExtracting terms from these headlines and the provided text snippets, we get terms like \"doc2vec embeddings,\" \"random forest sensitivity,\" \"regulatory buffers,\" and \"textual risk markers.\" These terms represent precise concepts related to the query and include terminology experts would use.\n\nAs I apply the journalistic investigation technique, I notice that the process is revealing insights that connect the use of deep learning and news analysis for predicting bank distress. For instance, the importance of integrating textual features from financial news with traditional financial ratios becomes apparent. This step of the technique is leading me to consider how hybrid models combining Random Forest and neural networks could improve accuracy in predictive modeling.\n\nHowever, I also find myself occasionally reconsidering the approach, wondering if we're overlooking simpler, more straightforward methods that could achieve similar results. This moment of stepping back to reassess is crucial, as it allows me to balance structured steps with natural thought patterns, ensuring that the final expanded query is both comprehensive and practical.\n\nThrough this process, insights are emerging from both the structured technique and my intuition. For example, applying the journalistic investigation approach leads me to discover the potential of Doc2Vec embeddings in analyzing financial news, which reminds me of the related concept of using BERT for similar tasks. This connection highlights the importance of exploring different NLP techniques in the context of bank distress prediction.\n\nFinally, synthesizing the insights gained, I believe the expanded query should incorporate terms that capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking. The augmented query, \"bank distress event modeling using deep learning news text analysis,\" effectively combines the original query intent with valuable new terms. This approach ensures that the final terms emerge logically from both the technique and natural insights, reflecting a realistic thought process that balances structured techniques with natural cognitive patterns.",
