  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: Autonomous driving has shown the capability of providing driver convenience and enhancing safety. While introducing autonomous driving into our current traffic system, one significant issue is to make the autonomous vehicle be able to react in the same way as real human drivers. In order to ensure that an autonomous vehicle of the future will perform like human drivers, this paper proposes a vehicle motion planning model, which can represent how drivers control vehicles based on the assessment of traffic environments in the real signalized intersection. The proposed motion planning model comprises functions of pedestrian intention detection, gap detection and vehicle dynamic control. The three functions are constructed based on the analysis of actual data collected from real traffic environments. Finally, this paper demonstrates the performance of the proposed method by comparing the behaviors of our model with the behaviors of real pedestrians and human drivers. The experimental results show that our proposed model can achieve 85% recognition rate for the pedestrian crossing intention. Moreover, the vehicle controlled by the proposed motion planning model and the actual human-driven vehicle are highly similar with respect to the gap acceptance in intersections.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: Part I of this paper proposed a development process and a system platform for the development of autonomous cars based on a distributed system architecture. The proposed development methodology enabled the design and development of an autonomous car with benefits such as a reduction in computational complexity, fault-tolerant characteristics, and system modularity. In this paper (Part II), a case study of the proposed development methodology is addressed by showing the implementation process of an autonomous driving system. In order to describe the implementation process intuitively, core autonomous driving algorithms (localization, perception, planning, vehicle control, and system management) are briefly introduced and applied to the implementation of an autonomous driving system. We are able to examine the advantages of a distributed system architecture and the proposed development process by conducting a case study on the autonomous system implementation. The validity of the proposed methodology is proved through the autonomous car A1 that won the 2012 Autonomous Vehicle Competition in Korea with all missions completed.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: In urban environments, moving obstacles detection and free space determination are key issues for driving assistance systems and autonomous vehicles. When using lidar sensors scanning in front of the vehicle, uncertainty arises from ignorance and errors. Ignorance is due to the perception of new areas and errors come from imprecise pose estimation and noisy measurements. Complexity is also increased when the lidar provides multi-echo and multi-layer information. This paper presents an occupancy grid framework that has been designed to manage these different sources of uncertainty. A way to address this problem is to use grids projected onto the road surface in global and local frames. The global one generates the mapping and the local one is used to deal with moving objects. A credibilist approach is used to model the sensor information and to do a global fusion with the world-fixed map. Outdoor experimental results carried out with a precise positioning system show that such a perception strategy increases significantly the performance compared to a standard approach.\n",
  "thought_process": "As I delve into the query \"Could We Issue Driving Licenses to Autonomous Vehicles?\", my initial thoughts revolve around the complexity of this issue. It's not just about the technical feasibility of autonomous vehicles (AVs) but also about the regulatory, ethical, and legal implications of such a move. I think about how licensing authorities would need to adapt their frameworks to accommodate AVs, considering factors like safety standards, liability, and public acceptance.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the existing resources provide valuable insights into reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for AVs, covering both theoretical and practical aspects. However, there seems to be a lack of discussion on non-technical factors like ethics and alternative methods beyond RL. This tells me that the query expansion should not only focus on technical terms but also incorporate social, legal, and ethical considerations.\n\nI decide to approach this query expansion using the \"Query Expansion via User Intent and Journey Mapping\" technique. This involves creating user personas with varying expertise levels and motivations, analyzing their search vocabulary, mapping their information journey, and identifying specific usage scenarios for the information sought. By doing so, I aim to capture the diverse intents and needs of users searching for information on this topic.\n\nAs I create the user personas, I consider their goals, prior knowledge, and vocabulary differences. For instance, Alex, the novice policy analyst, might start with broad search terms like \"autonomous vehicle regulations,\" while Jordan, the intermediate software engineer, might use more specific terms like \"reinforcement learning algorithms for AVs.\" Taylor, the advanced researcher, might explore ethical implications, and Sam, the expert legal scholar, might focus on legal standards for machine autonomy.\n\nThrough this process, I identify key terms and phrases that reflect the diverse intents and needs of these users. I notice that terms like \"regulatory frameworks,\" \"reinforcement learning integration challenges,\" \"ethical implications of AI licensing,\" and \"legal standards for machine autonomy\" are crucial in capturing the essence of the query. I also consider the information journey of these users, from initial awareness to expert-level exploration, and how their search vocabulary evolves along the way.\n\nAs I apply the technique, I systematically analyze the search vocabulary, information journey, and usage scenarios for each persona. I extract high-value terms, contextual vocabulary, and intent-revealing terminology that clarifies the search purpose. I also consider alternative terminology, misconceptions, and the evolution of search terms as users progress in their journey.\n\nThrough this structured approach, I balance the systematic application of the technique with natural thought patterns, including reconsiderations, intuitive connections, and brief tangents. I reflect on how the technique helps me uncover insights that might have been overlooked, such as the importance of ethical considerations in AI licensing or the need for legal standards for machine autonomy.\n\nAs I synthesize the findings, I realize that the expanded query should indeed consider regulatory frameworks, reinforcement learning integration challenges, ethical implications of AI licensing, and legal standards for machine autonomy. The final augmented query, \"Could we issue driving licenses to autonomous vehicles considering regulatory frameworks, reinforcement learning integration challenges, ethical implications of AI licensing, and legal standards for machine autonomy?\", effectively captures the complexities and nuances of the original query.\n\nThrough this thought process, I demonstrate how the \"Query Expansion via User Intent and Journey Mapping\" technique can be applied to uncover the diverse intents and needs of users, and how this approach can lead to a more comprehensive and effective query expansion.",
