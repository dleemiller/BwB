  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: The SAP HANA database is positioned as the core of the SAP HANA Appliance to support complex business analytical processes in combination with transactionally consistent operational workloads. Within this paper, we outline the basic characteristics of the SAP HANA database, emphasizing the distinctive features that differentiate the SAP HANA database from other classical relational database management systems. On the technical side, the SAP HANA database consists of multiple data processing engines with a distributed query processing environment to provide the full spectrum of data processing -- from classical relational data supporting both row- and column-oriented physical representations in a hybrid engine, to graph and text processing for semi- and unstructured data management within the same system. From a more application-oriented perspective, we outline the specific support provided by the SAP HANA database of multiple domain-specific languages with a built-in set of natively implemented business functions. SQL -- as the lingua franca for relational database systems -- can no longer be considered to meet all requirements of modern applications, which demand the tight interaction with the data management layer. Therefore, the SAP HANA database permits the exchange of application semantics with the underlying data management platform that can be exploited to increase query expressiveness and to reduce the number of individual application-to-database round trips.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: Many traditional and new business applications work with inherently graphstructured data and therefore benefit from graph abstractions and operations provided in the data management layer. The property graph data model not only offers schema flexibility but also permits managing and processing data and metadata jointly. By having typical graph operations implemented directly in the database engine and exposing them both in the form of an intuitive programming interface and a declarative language, complex business application logic can be expressed more easily and executed very efficiently. In this paper we describe our ongoing work to extend the SAP HANA database with built-in graph data support. We see this as a next step on the way to provide an efficient and intuitive data management platform for modern business applications with SAP HANA.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n... In this State-of-the-Art Report, we survey available techniques for the visual analysis of large graphs. Our review firstly considers graph visualization techniques according to the type of graphs supported. The visualization techniques form the basis for the presentation of interaction approaches suitable for visual graph exploration. As an important component of visual graph analysis, we discuss various graph algorithmic aspects useful for the different stages of the visual graph analysis process.\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"SynopSys: large graph analytics in the SAP HANA database through summarization,\" this makes me think of how SAP HANA, as a powerful in-memory database, can handle complex graph data and the importance of summarization in making sense of this data. Though the user might actually be trying to understand how to apply graph analytics in a real-world scenario, perhaps in a business or network-centric context, the key here seems to be the interplay between SAP HANA's capabilities and the concept of summarization.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the documents retrieved offer insights into SAP HANA's capabilities for handling graph data, which is directly relevant to understanding its application in network-centric scenarios. However, they also contain information on general large-scale graph analytics and technologies not specific to SAP HANA. This tells me that while there's a strong foundation in understanding SAP HANA's graph analytics capabilities, there's a need to refine the query to focus more on the database-specific functionalities and summarization techniques.\n\nNow, let's approach this using the \"Query Expansion Through Journalistic Investigation\" technique, which involves treating the query like a story to be uncovered through investigative research. This technique should help because it encourages a deep dive into the real-world contexts, expert insights, and specific terminology related to the query.\n\nFirst, assessing the query, it seems the user is seeking both practical advice on how to summarize large graph data in SAP HANA and a conceptual understanding of how this can enhance decision-making. There are assumptions about SAP HANA's capabilities and knowledge gaps regarding the best methodologies for graph data summarization.\n\nConsidering real-world contexts, this query is relevant in professional settings, such as data analytics roles within companies using SAP HANA, in educational settings where students are learning about database management and graph analytics, and in personal situations where individuals are looking to upskill in data science.\n\nInvestigating resources, notable experts in database management and graph analytics, along with their contributions, are crucial. Established methodologies like graph processing algorithms and frameworks, essential terminology such as \"property graph data model\" and \"graph abstractions,\" and organizations involved in advancing database technologies are also vital.\n\nCreating headlines for articles that could address this query from multiple angles helps to further refine the search terms. For example, \"Enhancing Decision-Making with Graph Summarization in SAP HANA,\" \"A Beginner's Guide to Graph Analytics in SAP HANA,\" or \"Advanced Graph Processing Techniques for SAP HANA Professionals.\"\n\nExtracting terms from these headlines and considering the insights from the initial results, specific terms like \"SAP HANA graph analytics,\" \"graph data summarization,\" \"network-centric applications,\" and \"database extensions for graphs\" emerge as key. These terms represent precise concepts related to the query and include terminology that experts would use.\n\nAs I apply the journalistic investigation technique, I start to see how the original query can be expanded to include these valuable terms. It's not just about adding keywords but about understanding the narrative of how graph analytics in SAP HANA can be leveraged for better decision-making through summarization.\n\nThe process involves systematic steps, but it's also organic, allowing for false starts and reconsiderations. For instance, initially, I thought focusing solely on SAP HANA's technical capabilities would be enough, but the technique encouraged me to explore broader contexts and expert insights, leading to a more comprehensive understanding.\n\nInsights are emerging from both the structured approach of the technique and my natural thought patterns. Applying the journalistic investigation technique leads to the discovery of specific terms and concepts, like \"property graph data model\" and \"graph abstractions,\" which are crucial for understanding how SAP HANA can be used for large graph analytics. Simultaneously, my intuition suggests that practical applications and case studies are just as important as the technical aspects, reinforcing the need for a balanced approach.\n\nSynthesizing this information, I believe the expanded query should capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking. Terms like \"SAP HANA graph analytics,\" \"graph data summarization,\" and \"network-centric applications\" are essential. The final expanded query, \"Summarizing large-scale graph data in SAP HANA: Enhancing decision-making through database-specific extensions and practical applications,\" reflects this comprehensive approach.\n\nThrough this process of applying the journalistic investigation technique and exploring related threads, I've come to understand how the original query can be refined to better capture the user's information needs. The goal is to create a query that not only reflects the technical aspects of SAP HANA and graph analytics but also considers the real-world contexts and expert insights that can enhance decision-making through summarization.",
