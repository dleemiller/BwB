  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: In this paper, we investigate how to modify the naive Bayes classifier in order to perform classification that is restricted to be independent with respect to a given sensitive attribute. Such independency restrictions occur naturally when the decision process leading to the labels in the data-set was biased; e.g., due to gender or racial discrimination. This setting is motivated by many cases in which there exist laws that disallow a decision that is partly based on discrimination. Naive application of machine learning techniques would result in huge fines for companies. We present three approaches for making the naive Bayes classifier discrimination-free: (i) modifying the probability of the decision being positive, (ii) training one model for every sensitive attribute value and balancing them, and (iii) adding a latent variable to the Bayesian model that represents the unbiased label and optimizing the model parameters for likelihood using expectation maximization. We present experiments for the three approaches on both artificial and real-life data.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: In practice, there are often explicit constraints on what representations or decisions are acceptable in an application of machine learning. For example it may be a legal requirement that a decision must not favour a particular group. Alternatively it can be that that representation of data must not have identifying information. We address these two related issues by learning flexible representations that minimize the capability of an adversarial critic. This adversary is trying to predict the relevant sensitive variable from the representation, and so minimizing the performance of the adversary ensures there is little or no information in the representation about the sensitive variable. We demonstrate this adversarial approach on two problems: making decisions free from discrimination and removing private information from images. We formulate the adversarial model as a minimax problem, and optimize that minimax objective using a stochastic gradient alternate min-max optimizer. We demonstrate the ability to provide discriminant free representations for standard test problems, and compare with previous state of the art methods for fairness, showing statistically significant improvement across most cases. The flexibility of this method is shown via a novel problem: removing annotations from images, from separate training examples of annotated and unannotated images, and with no a priori knowledge of the form of annotation provided to the model.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: Rough set theory can be applied to rule induction. There are two different types of classification rules, positive and boundary rules, leading to different decisions and consequences. They can be distinguished not only from the syntax measures such as confidence, coverage and generality, but also the semantic measures such as decision-monotocity, cost and risk. The classification rules can be evaluated locally for each individual rule, or globally for a set of rules. Both the two types of classification rules can be generated from, and interpreted by, a decision-theoretic model, which is a probabilistic extension of the Pawlak rough set model. As an important concept of rough set theory, an attribute reduct is a subset of attributes that are jointly sufficient and individually necessary for preserving a particular property of the given information table. This paper addresses attribute reduction in decision-theoretic rough set models regarding different classification properties, such as: decisionmonotocity, confidence, coverage, generality and cost. It is important to note that many of these properties can be truthfully reflected by a single measure c in the Pawlak rough set model. On the other hand, they need to be considered separately in probabilistic models. A straightforward extension of the c measure is unable to evaluate these properties. This study provides a new insight into the problem of attribute reduction. Crown Copyright 2008 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.\n",
  "thought_process": "Let's dive into expanding the query \"Measuring discrimination in algorithmic decision making\" by applying the query expansion technique via user intent and journey mapping. My initial impression of this query is that it's quite specific and technical, suggesting the user is likely looking for advanced information on how to assess and address bias in machine learning models. However, to ensure our search results are comprehensive and helpful to a wide range of users, we need to consider diverse user personas and their varying levels of expertise.\n\nStarting with user personas, we have the novice user who might be a student researching algorithmic bias for a class project. This user would likely start with broad, introductory terms like \"algorithmic fairness\" and \"bias in machine learning.\" On the other hand, an intermediate user, perhaps a data scientist, would be looking for more specific information on \"fairness metrics,\" \"disparate impact,\" and \"bias mitigation techniques.\" The advanced user, a machine learning researcher, would delve into \"statistical parity,\" \"equal opportunity,\" and \"causal inference for fairness,\" indicating a deeper understanding of the technical aspects of fairness in AI. Lastly, the expert, possibly a policymaker, would focus on \"fairness-aware algorithms,\" \"algorithmic accountability,\" and the \"social impact assessment of AI,\" reflecting their concern with the broader implications and regulations surrounding AI fairness.\n\nAs we analyze the search vocabulary across these personas, it becomes clear that the terms used vary significantly with the level of expertise. Novices rely on more general terms, while experts use specialized vocabulary that reflects their deeper understanding of the subject. This analysis helps in identifying a spectrum of terms that can be used to expand the original query, making it more inclusive of different user needs.\n\nNow, let's apply the structured approach of query expansion via user intent and journey mapping. This involves several steps, starting with understanding the user's intent behind the search query. The intent here seems to be about understanding, measuring, and mitigating discrimination in algorithmic decision-making. This can be further broken down into specific intents such as understanding bias, measuring fairness, mitigating discrimination, developing fair models, evaluating algorithmic impact, and promoting ethical AI.\n\nFollowing the technique, we should map the information journey of our users. At the entry point, users might ask basic questions like \"What is algorithmic discrimination?\" and \"How does it occur?\" As they progress, they would seek information on different types of bias, measurement techniques, and methods for mitigating bias. Advanced users would delve into the theoretical foundations of fairness, limitations of current approaches, and open research questions. Experts would focus on policy implications, legal frameworks, and best practices for developing and deploying fair AI systems.\n\nIn applying this technique, I notice that my initial thoughts about the query's specificity were correct, but there's a broader range of user intents and information needs than I initially considered. The structured approach helps in systematically identifying these needs and corresponding search terms. For instance, applying the fairness metrics aspect of our technique leads to the discovery of terms like \"statistical parity\" and \"equal opportunity,\" which are crucial for advanced users. This systematic approach also reminds me of related concepts, such as \"causal inference for fairness,\" which might not have been immediately apparent without this structured analysis.\n\nAs I step back to reassess, I realize that balancing structured techniques with natural cognitive patterns is key. The technique provides a framework, but my intuition and experience suggest that users might also search for terms related to real-world case studies and ethical considerations, reflecting a desire for practical applications and moral implications of algorithmic discrimination.\n\nThrough this process, insights emerge from both the structured technique and my natural thought patterns. For example, the technique highlights the importance of \"fairness-aware algorithms\" and \"algorithmic accountability,\" while my intuition suggests that \"real-world case studies\" and \"ethical considerations\" are also vital. This synthesis of structured and intuitive thinking leads to a more comprehensive understanding of what users are looking for.\n\nIn conclusion, by applying the query expansion technique via user intent and journey mapping and balancing it with natural thought patterns, we can generate an expanded query that captures the diversity of user needs and intents. The final expanded query, \"algorithmic discrimination machine learning fairness metrics mitigation techniques real world case studies ethical considerations,\" reflects both the explicit and implicit aspects of what users are seeking, from understanding and measuring bias to promoting ethical AI practices.\n\nThis thought process demonstrates how an expert blends structured techniques with natural cognitive elements, such as reconsiderations, intuitive leaps, and connections, to create a comprehensive and effective search query expansion. It shows that while structured approaches provide a valuable framework, they must be complemented with the nuances of human thought to truly capture the complexity of user information needs.",
