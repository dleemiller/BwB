  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: The social media network phenomenon creates massive amounts of valuable data that is available online and easy to access. Many users share images, videos, comments, reviews, news and opinions on different social networks sites, with Twitter being one of the most popular ones. Data collected from Twitter is highly unstructured, and extracting useful information from tweets is a challenging task. Twitter has a huge number of Arabic users who mostly post and write their tweets using the Arabic language. While there has been a lot of research on sentiment analysis in English, the amount of researches and datasets in Arabic language is limited. This paper introduces an Arabic language dataset, which is about opinions on health services and has been collected from Twitter. The paper will first detail the process of collecting the data from Twitter and also the process of filtering, pre-processing and annotating the Arabic text in order to build a big sentiment analysis dataset in Arabic. Several Machine Learning algorithms (Na\u00efve Bayes, Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression) alongside Deep and Convolutional Neural Networks were utilized in our experiments of sentiment analysis on our health dataset.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: We present Sentiment Analyzer (SA) that extracts sentiment (or opinion) about a subject from online text documents. Instead of classifying the sentiment of an entire document about a subject, SA detects all references to the given subject, and determines sentiment in each of the references using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. Our sentiment analysis consists of 1) a topic specific feature term extraction, 2) sentiment extraction, and 3) (subject, sentiment) association by relationship analysis. SA utilizes two linguistic resources for the analysis: the sentiment lexicon and the sentiment pattern database. The performance of the algorithms was verified on online product review articles (\u201cdigital camera\u201d and \u201cmusic\u201d reviews), and more general documents including general webpages and news articles.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: Sentiment Analysis deals with the analysis of emotions, opinions and facts in the sentences which are expressed by the people. It allows us to track attitudes and feelings of the people by analyzing blogs, comments, reviews and tweets about all the aspects. The development of Internet has strong influence in all types of industries like tourism, healthcare and any business. The availability of Internet has changed the way of accessing the information and sharing their experience among users. Social media provide this information and these comments are trusted by other users. This paper recognizes the use and impact of social media on healthcare industry by analyzing the users\u2019 feelings expressed in the form of free text, thereby gives the quality indicators of services or features related with them. In this paper, a sentiment classifier model using improved Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TFIDF) method and linear regression model has been proposed to classify online reviews, tweets or customer feedback for various features. The model involves the process of gathering online user reviews about hospitals and analyzes those reviews in terms of sentiments expressed. ...\n",
  "thought_process": "As I begin to explore the query \"Subjectivity and Sentiment Analysis of Modern Standard Arabic,\" my initial impression is that this topic is quite specialized, focusing on the nuances of Arabic language processing. This makes me think of the complexities involved in natural language processing (NLP) and how sentiment analysis can vary significantly across different languages and cultures. The user might be trying to understand how to apply computational methods to distinguish between subjective and sentiment analysis in Arabic texts, which seems like a challenging task given the linguistic and cultural specifics of the language.\n\nAnalyzing the results from the original query, I notice that the documents primarily delve into sentiment analysis methodologies, with some mention of subjectivity. However, there seems to be a gap in the exploration of subjectivity as a distinct analytical dimension. This indicates that the search terms might need expansion to better capture the nuances of subjectivity in Modern Standard Arabic.\n\nTo approach this systematically, I decide to use the \"Query Expansion Through Journalistic Investigation\" technique. This involves treating the query like a story that needs comprehensive coverage, requiring me to dig deeper into related real-world contexts, identify key resources, and extract high-value terms.\n\nStarting with real-world contexts, I consider professional settings like research institutions and industries that utilize Arabic NLP, educational environments teaching Arabic language and computer science, and personal situations where individuals might need to analyze Arabic texts for subjectivity or sentiment. I also think about specialized communities, such as linguists, computer scientists, and cultural experts, who could provide insights into the challenges and methodologies of analyzing Arabic texts.\n\nNext, I investigate resourceful information sources, including notable experts in Arabic NLP, established methodologies for subjectivity and sentiment analysis, essential terminology, and organizations involved in language processing research. This step is crucial for understanding the current state of knowledge in the field and identifying gaps that the expanded query could help fill.\n\nCreating diverse headlines for articles that could address the query from multiple angles helps me to think creatively about the topic. For example, \"A Beginner's Guide to Subjectivity vs. Sentiment Analysis in Arabic NLP,\" \"Advanced Algorithms for Arabic Subjectivity Detection,\" and \"Cultural Nuances in Arabic Sentiment Analysis\" suggest different approaches to exploring the topic. These headlines also help in extracting specific, high-value terms related to the query, such as \"subjectivity analysis distinction,\" \"preprocessing techniques for subjectivity,\" and \"machine learning models for subjectivity detection.\"\n\nApplying the journalistic investigation technique systematically, I consider each step's findings and how they can be integrated into the query expansion. I reflect on how the extracted terms can enhance the original query, making it more comprehensive and likely to yield relevant results. The process involves some false starts and reconsiderations, as initially, I thought to focus heavily on sentiment analysis before realizing the need to distinguish and emphasize subjectivity analysis.\n\nMoments of stepping back to reassess the query and its expansion are invaluable. They allow me to ensure that the augmented query remains true to the user's original intent while incorporating the insights gained from the investigation. It's a balancing act between structured technique and natural cognitive patterns, where the technique provides a framework, and intuition guides the application of that framework.\n\nThrough this process, insights emerge from both the structured approach and natural thought patterns. For instance, recognizing the importance of cultural nuances in Arabic NLP leads me to consider how dialectical challenges might impact subjectivity analysis. Similarly, exploring machine learning models for subjectivity detection points towards the potential for advanced algorithms to uncover subtle expressions of subjectivity in Arabic texts.\n\nSynthesizing the findings with clarity, I conclude that the expanded query should indeed focus on the distinction between subjectivity and sentiment analysis, incorporate terms related to preprocessing techniques for subjectivity, and include references to machine learning models and cultural nuances. This comprehensive approach should yield a more precise and useful set of results for understanding subjectivity analysis in Modern Standard Arabic.\n\nThus, the thought process involves a dynamic interplay between structured technique, organic thinking, and the iterative refinement of the query, ensuring that the final expanded query is both logically derived and intuitively insightful.",
