  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: A novel broadband millimeter-wave passive power combiner based on substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) to waveguide transition is presented in this letter. Two transition circuits are symmetrically inserted into the E-plane of the rectangular waveguide and function as power-combining network. To satisfy the wideband request of the power combiner, a broadband and compact SIW-to-waveguide transition circuit has been developed using antisymmetric tapered probe. A Ka-band four-way power combiner was fabricated and the measured results agree well with the simulated ones. The measured results show that the proposed combiner achieved a bandwidth of 52% from 23.5 to 40 GHz with better than 15 dB return loss and an insertion loss of 0.75 to 1.4 dB. This millimeter-wave power combiner can be employed in high power-combining system for its simple structure and broadband performance.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: High power, broad bandwidth, high linearity, and low noise are among the most important features in amplifier design. The broad-band spatial power-combining technique addresses all these issues by combining the output power of a large quantity of microwave monolithic integrated circuit (MMIC) amplifiers in a broad-band coaxial waveguide environment, while maintaining good linearity and improving phase noise of the MMIC amplifiers. A coaxial waveguide was used as the host of the combining circuits for broader bandwidth and better uniformity by equally distributing the input power to each element. A new compact coaxial combiner with much smaller size is investigated. Broad-band slotline to microstrip-line transition is integrated for better compatibility with commercial MMIC amplifiers. Thermal simulations are performed and an improved thermal management scheme over previous designs is employed to improve the heat sinking in high-power application. A high-power amplifier using the compact combiner design is built and demonstrated to have a bandwidth from 6 to 17 GHz with 44-W maximum output power. Linearity measurement has shown a high third-order intercept point of 52 dBm. Analysis shows the amplifier has the ability to extend spurious-free dynamic range by 2 3 times. The amplifier also has shown a residual phase floor close to 140 dBc at 10-kHz offset from the carrier with 5\u20136-dB reductions compared to a single MMIC amplifier it integrates.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: In this letter, a broadband bent triangular omnidirectional antenna is presented for RF energy harvesting. The antenna has a bandwidth for VSWR \u2264 2 from 850 MHz to 1.94 GHz. The antenna is designed to receive both horizontal and vertical polarized waves and has a stable radiation pattern over the entire bandwidth. Antenna has also been optimized for energy harvesting application and it is designed for 100 \u03a9 input impedance to provide a passive voltage amplification and impedance matching to the rectifier. A peak efficiency of 60% and 17% is obtained for a load of 500 \u03a9 at 980 and 1800 MHz, respectively. At a cell site while harvesting all bands simultaneously a voltage of 3.76 V for open circuit and 1.38 V across a load of 4.3 k \u03a9 is obtained at a distance of 25 m using an array of two elements of the rectenna.\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"Broadband millimetre-wave passive spatial combiner based on coaxial waveguide,\" this makes me think of a very specific technical requirement, likely for someone working in the field of telecommunications or microwave engineering. Though the user might actually be trying to understand how to design or implement such a combiner, or perhaps they're looking for ways to improve its performance. Hmm, not sure yet, but it seems like we're dealing with a highly specialized topic here.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that we're getting a lot of technical papers and research articles discussing various aspects of millimeter-wave technology, power combiners, and coaxial waveguides. The strengths of these search terms lie in their specificity, allowing us to quickly identify relevant academic and technical resources. However, the weaknesses become apparent when considering users who might not be familiar with the exact terminology or who are looking for more practical, applied information.\n\nTransitioning to a more structured approach, I'll be using the technique of Query Expansion via User Intent and Journey Mapping. This involves creating user personas, analyzing search vocabulary, mapping information journeys, identifying contextual scenarios, and extracting intent-based terms. By applying this technique, we can better understand how different users would seek information on this topic and expand our search terms accordingly. This should help because it allows us to cater to a broader audience, including those who might not know the exact technical terms or who are looking for information related to specific applications.\n\nApplying the steps of the technique systematically, I start by creating user personas. We have the RF Engineer (Novice), the Microwave System Designer (Intermediate), the Research Scientist (Advanced), and the Product Development Engineer (Expert). Each persona has different goals, prior knowledge, and vocabulary. For instance, the novice engineer might start with basic questions about spatial power combining, while the expert engineer is looking for the most cost-effective and reliable spatial combiner solution using coaxial waveguides.\n\nAs I analyze the search vocabulary for each persona, I notice that there are common terms like \"mmWave power combiner\" and \"coaxial waveguide,\" but also more specific terms related to design, implementation, and performance. The intermediate designer, for example, might use terms like \"broadband spatial power combining\" and \"coaxial waveguide combiner efficiency.\" The advanced researcher, on the other hand, might be interested in \"novel spatial power combining architectures\" and \"quasi-optical power combining.\"\n\nInterspersing this structured approach with natural thought patterns, I find myself occasionally reconsidering the personas or adjusting the vocabulary based on new insights. For instance, I realize that the novice engineer might also be interested in understanding the basics of millimeter waves and coaxial waveguides, not just spatial power combining. This leads me to include terms like \"what is spatial power combining\" and \"coaxial waveguide basics\" in our expanded query.\n\nAs I continue to apply the technique, I start to see insights emerging from both the structure and my intuition. The use of \"broadband\" and \"passive\" in the original query, for example, suggests that the user is looking for a combiner that can handle a wide range of frequencies without actively amplifying the signal. This leads me to include terms like \"broadband millimeter-wave passive spatial combiner\" and \"low loss coaxial waveguide combiner\" in our expanded query.\n\nStepping back to reassess, I notice that our expanded query is starting to capture the essence of what the user is seeking. We have a mix of technical terms, design considerations, and application-specific vocabulary. The query now looks like: \"broadband millimetre wave passive spatial combiner coaxial waveguide design implementation performance efficiency bandwidth limitations novel architectures fabrication techniques.\"\n\nThrough this process of applying the Query Expansion via User Intent and Journey Mapping technique and exploring related threads, I believe the terms in our expanded query would be most effective for retrieving relevant information. They capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, from technical specifications to practical applications and design considerations.",
