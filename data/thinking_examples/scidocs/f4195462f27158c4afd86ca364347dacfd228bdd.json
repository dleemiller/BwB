  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: For new automotive applications and services, information technology (IT) has gained central importance. IT-related costs in car manufacturing are already high and they will increase dramatically in the future. Yet whereas safety and reliability have become a relatively well-established field, the protection of vehicular IT systems against systematic manipulation or intrusion has only recently started to emerge. Nevertheless, IT security is already the base of some vehicular applications such as immobilizers or digital tachographs. To securely enable future automotive applications and business models, IT security will be one of the central technologies for the next generation of vehicles. After a state-of-the-art overview of IT security in vehicles, we give a short introduction into cryptographic terminology and functionality. This contribution will then identify the need for automotive IT security while presenting typical attacks, resulting security objectives, and characteristic constraints within the automotive area. We will introduce core security technologies and relevant security mechanisms followed by a detailed description of critical vehicular applications, business models, and components relying on IT security. We conclude our contribution with a detailed statement about challenges and opportunities for the automotive IT community for embedding IT security in vehicles.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: Organizations develop technical and procedural measures to protect information systems. Relying only on technical based security solutions is not enough. Organizations must consider technical security solutions along with social, human, and organizational factors. The human element represents the employees (insiders) who use the information systems and other technology resources in their day-to-day operations. ISP awareness is essential to protect organizational information systems. This study adapts the Innovation Diffusion Theory to examine the antecedents of ISP awareness and its impact on the satisfaction with ISP and security practices. A sample of 236 employees in universities in the United States is collected to evaluate the research model. Results indicated that ISP quality, self-efficacy, and technology security awareness significantly impact ISP awareness. The current study presents significant contributions toward understanding the antecedents of ISP awareness and provides a starting point toward including satisfaction aspect in information security behavioral domain.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: Data is increasingly affecting the automotive industry, from vehicle development, to manufacturing and service processes, to online services centered around the connected vehicle. Connected, mobile and Internet of Things devices and machines generate immense amounts of sensor data. The ability to process and analyze this data to extract insights and knowledge that enable intelligent services, new ways to understand business problems, improvements of processes and decisions, is a critical capability. Hadoop is a scalable platform for compute and storage and emerged as de-facto standard for Big Data processing at Internet companies and in the scientific community. However, there is a lack of understanding of how and for what use cases these new Hadoop capabilities can be efficiently used to augment automotive applications and systems. This paper surveys use cases and applications for deploying Hadoop in the automotive industry. Over the years a rich ecosystem emerged around Hadoop comprising tools for parallel, in-memory and stream processing (most notable MapReduce and Spark), SQL and NOSQL engines (Hive, HBase), and machine learning (Mahout, MLlib). It is critical to develop an understanding of automotive applications and their characteristics and requirements for data discovery, integration, exploration and analytics. ...\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"Towards an Information Security Framework for the Automotive Domain,\" this makes me think of how information security has evolved over time, especially with the rapid advancement of technology in the automotive industry. The user might actually be trying to understand how to protect vehicles from cyber threats, considering the increasing reliance on IT systems in cars. However, the initial search results seem broad, lacking specificity to the automotive context. \n\nAnalyzing the results, I notice that they touch on general information security concepts, such as IT security, cryptographic terminology, and the importance of security in vehicular applications. But they don't delve deep into the automotive domain specifically. For instance, the text snippet from document at k=1 discusses the need for IT security in vehicles and introduces cryptographic terminology but doesn't provide a comprehensive framework for the automotive domain.\n\nTo better understand and expand this query, I'll approach it using the Temporal Evolution Analysis technique. This involves analyzing how the query topic has evolved through time and will likely develop in the future to discover temporally diverse terminology. The process starts with identifying the historical foundation of information security in the automotive domain, then maps key developmental milestones, assesses the current landscape, and projects emerging trends.\n\nHistorically, information security has its roots in cryptography and data confidentiality, with early applications in military and government practices. The development of computer networks and the emergence of cyber threats marked a significant milestone, leading to the standardization of security protocols like ISO/IEC 27001. The rise of risk management frameworks and increased focus on privacy regulations, such as GDPR, further shaped the field. Specifically, in the automotive domain, the development of automotive cybersecurity standards like UNECE WP.29 has been crucial.\n\nThe current landscape is characterized by concepts like zero-trust architecture, threat modeling, and the integration of artificial intelligence in cybersecurity. Automotive security guidelines, such as ISO 26262, play a vital role. Emerging trends include the use of blockchain for secure data exchange, edge computing security, and the security of autonomous driving systems.\n\nApplying the Temporal Evolution Analysis technique, I should first identify foundational terms like \"information theory\" and \"cryptography,\" then move on to modern terms such as \"network security\" and \"risk management.\" Contemporary terms would include \"zero-trust architecture\" and \"artificial intelligence in cybersecurity.\" However, considering the specific needs of the automotive domain, terms like \"automotive cybersecurity standards,\" \"blockchain for secure data exchange,\" and \"edge computing security challenges\" become particularly relevant.\n\nAs I apply this technique, I notice that the evolution of information security in the automotive domain is not just about adopting general cybersecurity practices but also about understanding the unique challenges and technologies of the automotive industry. The use of artificial intelligence for threat detection, the security of autonomous vehicles, and the application of blockchain for secure data exchange are areas that require special attention.\n\nThis process of applying Temporal Evolution Analysis and exploring related threads has led me to believe that terms such as \"automotive cybersecurity standards,\" \"artificial intelligence threat detection,\" \"blockchain for secure data exchange,\" \"edge computing security challenges,\" and \"autonomous driving security vulnerabilities\" would be most effective for expanding the query. These terms capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, providing a comprehensive approach to developing an Information Security Framework for the Automotive Domain.\n\nThrough this structured approach, complemented by natural cognitive elements like reconsiderations and intuitive connections, I've synthesized a thought process that mirrors how an expert would expand a query\u2014balancing structured techniques with the nuances of human intuition and experience.",
