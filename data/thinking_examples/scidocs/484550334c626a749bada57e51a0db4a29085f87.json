  "reasoning": "The original query 'Global outer-urban navigation with OpenStreetMap' aims to understand how OpenStreetMap can facilitate autonomous or manual navigation in less densely populated, outer-urban areas. The existing results focus more on urban and GNSS-denied environments using proprietary systems, which do not directly address the user's interest in outer-urban scenarios or specifically leverage OpenStreetMap. Therefore, expanding the query involves reframing it to explore personal experiences, practical advice, diverse opinions, and comparative insights regarding navigation challenges in such areas, using community Q&A patterns. Additionally, extracting terminology used in informal discussions will help capture conversational nuances relevant for outer-urban settings.",

  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: In the past, there has been a tremendous progress in the area of autonomous robot navigation and a large variety of robots have been developed who demonstrated robust navigation capabilities indoors, in non-urban outdoor environments, or on roads and relatively few approaches focus on navigation in urban environments such as city centers. Urban areas, however, introduce numerous challenges for autonomous robots as they are rather unstructured and dynamic. In this paper, we present a navigation system for mobile robots designed to operate in crowded city environments and pedestrian zones. We describe the different components of this system including a SLAM module for dealing with huge maps of city centers, a planning component for inferring feasible paths taking also into account the traversability and type of terrain, a module for accurate localization in dynamic environments, and means for calibrating and monitoring the platform. Our navigation system has been implemented and tested in several large-scale field tests, in which a real robot autonomously navigated over several kilometers in a complex urban environment. This also included a public demonstration, during which the robot autonomously traveled along a more than three kilometer long route through the city center of Freiburg, Germany.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n... Lidar, camera, and radar data streams are processed using an innovative, locally smooth state representation that provides robust perception for real-time autonomous control. A resilient planning and control architecture has been developed for driving in traffic, comprised of an innovative combination of well-proven algorithms for mission planning, situational planning, situational interpretation, and trajectory control. These innovations are being incorporated in two new robotic vehicles equipped for autonomous driving in urban environments, with extensive testing on a DARPA site visit course. Experimental results demonstrate all basic navigation and some basic traffic behaviors, including unoccupied autonomous driving, lane following using pure-pursuit control and our local frame perception strategy, obstacle avoidance using kino-dynamic RRT path planning, U-turns, and precedence evaluation amongst other cars at intersections using our situational interpreter. We are working to extend these approaches to advanced navigation and traffic scenarios.

In this study the SLEUTH model was used to model the urban expansion and predict the future possible behavior of the urban growth in Tehran. The fundamental data were five Landsat TM and ETM images of 1988, 1992, 1998, 2001 and 2010. Three scenarios were designed to simulate the spatial pattern. The first scenario assumed historical urbanization mode would persist and the only limitations for development were height and slope. The second one was a compact scenario which makes the growth mostly internal and limited the expansion of suburban areas. The last scenario proposed a polycentric urban structure which let the little patches * Corresponding author. Tel.: +98 912 3572913 E-mail address: shaghayegh.kargozar@yahoo.com\n",
  "thought_process": "As I begin to expand the query \"Global outer-urban navigation with OpenStreetMap,\" I'm immediately drawn into thinking about the challenges of navigating in less densely populated areas. The original query seems straightforward, but upon closer inspection, it reveals a need to understand not just the technical capabilities of OpenStreetMap in these environments, but also the personal experiences and practical advice that can be gleaned from community discussions.\n\nMy initial impressions are that the user is seeking more than just technical specifications or features of OpenStreetMap. They want to know how it performs in real-world scenarios, specifically in outer-urban areas where navigation can be tricky due to less detailed mapping or fewer landmarks. This makes me think about how people discuss their experiences with navigation tools in online forums or Q&A platforms. They often share stories of successes and failures, offer tips and tricks, and compare different tools or services.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that they focus more on urban environments and proprietary systems, which aren't directly relevant to the user's interest in outer-urban navigation with OpenStreetMap. This indicates a gap in the information provided by the initial search results, highlighting the need for a more nuanced and community-driven approach to query expansion.\n\nTo systematically approach this, I'll use the Query Expansion via Community Q&A Patterns technique. This involves reframing the query into various question types that solicit personal experiences, advice, opinions, comparisons, and stories. For instance, \"What is it like navigating in outer-urban areas with OpenStreetMap?\" or \"How should I improve navigation accuracy in outer-urban areas using OpenStreetMap?\" These question types can uncover valuable insights and terminology used in community discussions.\n\nAs I apply this technique, I start to identify hidden motivations behind the query. The user might be seeking validation that OpenStreetMap is effective in outer-urban areas, looking for decision support on how to enhance navigation performance, or seeking insider knowledge from others who have faced similar challenges. They might also be interested in diverse perspectives on the effectiveness of OpenStreetMap compared to other services like Google Maps.\n\nThe next step involves mapping valuable response patterns, such as first-person narratives, expert opinions, practical advice, alternative viewpoints, and nuanced conditional answers. These patterns can provide a rich source of information on how to navigate outer-urban areas effectively with OpenStreetMap.\n\nInterspersed with these structured steps, my natural thought process wanders to considerations of how community interactions might evolve around this topic. I imagine follow-up questions, debates about the merits of open-source versus proprietary mapping services, requests for clarification on specific challenges, and discussions that branch out into related topics like data availability and customization of OpenStreetMap.\n\nThrough this process, I start to extract terminology that reflects how people discuss navigation challenges in outer-urban areas. Terms like \"GPS signal quality,\" \"real-world testing,\" \"mapping accuracy,\" and \"user-contributed data\" become significant. These terms not only reflect technical aspects but also the community's focus on practical, real-world experiences.\n\nAs insights emerge from both the structured technique and my intuitive connections, I begin to see a clearer picture of what the expanded query should encompass. It should capture real-world experiences, best practices, challenges with mapping accuracy, comparisons with other services, expert advice, and community insights into the effectiveness of OpenStreetMap for outer-urban navigation.\n\nSynthesizing all these elements, I conclude that the most effective terms for a BM25 index, derived from our expanded query, would indeed focus on practical, experiential, and comparative aspects of using OpenStreetMap in outer-urban areas. These terms balance the technical with the personal, reflecting how community discussions and expert advice can complement each other to provide a comprehensive understanding of the topic.",
