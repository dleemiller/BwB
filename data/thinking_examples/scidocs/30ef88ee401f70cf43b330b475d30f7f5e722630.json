  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: Stochastic modelling of non-stationary vector timeseries based on HMMs has been very successful for speech applications [5]. Recently it has been applied to a range of image recognition problems [7, 9]. Previously reported work [6] has investigated the use of HMMs to model human faces for identi cation purposes. Faces can be intuitively divided into regions such as the mouth, eyes, nose, etc., and these regions can be associated with the states of an HMM. The identi cation performance of a top-bottom HMM compares favourably with some of the well-known algorithms, for example eigenfaces as detailed in [8]. However, the HMM parameterisation in the work presented so far was arrived at by subjective intuition. This paper presents experimental results which show how identi cation rates vary with HMM parameters, and which indicate the most sensible choice of parameters. The paper is organised as follows: section 2 gives an overview of the HMM-based approach; section 3 details the training and recognition processes; section 4 describes the experimental setup; section 5 presents the identi cation results; section 6 concludes the paper.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: 3D face recognition has become a trending research direction in both industry and academia. It inherits advantages from traditional 2D face recognition, such as the natural recognition process and a wide range of applications. Moreover, 3D face recognition systems could accurately recognize human faces even under dim lights and with variant facial positions and expressions, in such conditions 2D face recognition systems would have immense difficulty to operate. This paper summarizes the history and the most recent progresses in 3D face recognition research domain. The frontier research results are introduced in three categories: pose-invariant recognition, expression-invariant recognition, and occlusion-invariant recognition. To promote future research, this paper collects information about publicly available 3D face databases. This paper also lists important open problems.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: This paper introduces a novel Gabor-Fisher (1936) classifier (GFC) for face recognition. The GFC method, which is robust to changes in illumination and facial expression, applies the enhanced Fisher linear discriminant model (EFM) to an augmented Gabor feature vector derived from the Gabor wavelet representation of face images. The novelty of this paper comes from 1) the derivation of an augmented Gabor feature vector, whose dimensionality is further reduced using the EFM by considering both data compression and recognition (generalization) performance; 2) the development of a Gabor-Fisher classifier for multi-class problems; and 3) extensive performance evaluation studies. In particular, we performed comparative studies of different similarity measures applied to various classifiers. We also performed comparative experimental studies of various face recognition schemes, including our novel GFC method, the Gabor wavelet method, the eigenfaces method, the Fisherfaces method, the EFM method, the combination of Gabor and the eigenfaces method, and the combination of Gabor and the Fisherfaces method. The feasibility of the new GFC method has been successfully tested on face recognition using 600 FERET frontal face images corresponding to 200 subjects, which were acquired under variable illumination and facial expressions. The novel GFC method achieves 100% accuracy on face recognition using only 62 features.\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"Face recognition under partial occlusion using HMM and Face Edge Length Model,\" this makes me think of the challenges in accurately identifying faces when parts of them are covered or obscured. Though the user might actually be trying to understand how to improve face recognition systems in such conditions, I'm not sure yet what specific aspects they're interested in - whether it's the theoretical foundations, practical implementations, or perhaps the nuances of dealing with different types of occlusions.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the top documents discuss various techniques such as Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), 3D face recognition, and Gabor-Fisher classifiers. These seem to highlight the strengths of using probabilistic models and multi-dimensional representations for face recognition. However, the weaknesses lie in the complexity of these models and their sensitivity to parameters and data quality. For instance, the document at k=1 discusses how HMM parameterization was previously subjective, indicating a need for systematic approaches to model selection and training.\n\nTo systematically approach this query expansion, I'll use the Conceptual Territory Mapping technique. This involves treating the query as a central point in a knowledge landscape that needs to be mapped and explored. The first step is to identify the central coordinates of our query, which are face recognition, partial occlusion, HMM, and Face Edge Length Model. The cardinal directions for exploration would include both theoretical and practical aspects, such as algorithmic details and real-world applications. Setting the scale for our exploration, we aim for a balance between granularity and breadth, covering enough ground to encompass related concepts without getting too bogged down in specifics.\n\nMoving to boundary exploration, we chart the immediate territory of face recognition under occlusion and identify neighboring domains such as computer vision, biometric security, and machine learning. Notably, areas where these territories overlap, such as in the application of deep learning techniques to both face recognition and object detection in computer vision, are particularly fruitful for exploration.\n\nLandmark identification involves plotting key concepts and resources. Here, landmarks would include specific algorithms like HMMs and Face Edge Length Models, as well as significant research papers or datasets that have advanced the field. The \"settlements\" or communities of practice would include researchers focusing on face recognition, biometric security experts, and developers of computer vision applications. Mapping \"routes\" or methodologies involves tracing the learning pathways and development processes that lead to effective face recognition systems under partial occlusion.\n\nIn detail mapping, we delve into specialized features within each region, such as occlusion detection methods, feature extraction techniques, and real-time implementation strategies. Labeling these with precise terminology, we note historical developments like the introduction of HMMs in speech recognition and their subsequent application to image recognition problems, as well as emerging trends such as the use of 3D facial models and masked face recognition techniques.\n\nCreating a cartographic legend, we compile a lexicon of the most important terms, classifying them by region and significance. Terms like \"occlusion-robust HMM,\" \"partial occlusion handling in FR,\" and \"Haar wavelet facial features\" are crucial for navigating this knowledge landscape. Selecting terms that would help a traveler understand the query's context and find relevant information, we prioritize those that connect different regions of the map, such as the intersection of HMMs with computer vision frameworks or the application of machine learning techniques to biometric authentication systems.\n\nThrough this process of applying Conceptual Territory Mapping and exploring related threads, I believe the terms that would be most effective for query expansion are those that capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of face recognition under partial occlusion. These include not just the technical terms like HMMs and Face Edge Length Models but also concepts related to occlusion detection, masked face recognition, and real-time implementation strategies. The final expanded query reflects a synthesis of structured technique and natural thought patterns, aiming to enhance the retrieval of relevant information on this complex topic.",
