  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: The precision of the answer is now essential for a question answering system, because of the large amount of free texts on the Internet. Attempting to achieve a high precision, we propose a question answering system supported by case grammar theory and based on VerbNet frames. It extracts the syntactic, thematic and semantic information from the question to filter out unmatched sentences in semantic level and to extract answer chunk (a phrase or a word that can answer the question) from the answer sentence. VerbNet is applied in our system to detect the verb frames in question and candidate sentences, so that the syntactic and thematic information as well as semantic information can be therefore obtained. Our question answering system works well especially for answering factoid questions. The experiments show that our approach is able to filter out semantically unmatched sentences effectively and therefore rank the correct answer (s) higher in the result list.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: How can we enable computers to automatically answer questions like \u201cWho created the character Harry Potter\u201d? Carefully built knowledge bases provide rich sources of facts. However, it remains a challenge to answer factoid questions raised in natural language due to numerous expressions of one question. In particular, we focus on the most common questions \u2014 ones that can be answered with a single fact in the knowledge base. We propose CFO, a Conditional Focused neuralnetwork-based approach to answering factoid questions with knowledge bases. Our approach first zooms in a question to find more probable candidate subject mentions, and infers the final answers with a unified conditional probabilistic framework. Powered by deep recurrent neural networks and neural embeddings, our proposed CFO achieves an accuracy of 75.7% on a dataset of 108k questions \u2013 the largest public one to date. It outperforms the current state of the art by an absolute margin of 11.8%.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: Microsoft Research Redmond participated for the first time in TREC this year, focusing on the question answering track. There is a separate report in this volume on the Microsoft Research Cambridge submissions for the filtering and Web tracks (Robertson et al., 2002). We have been exploring data-driven techniques for Web question answering, and modified our system somewhat for participation in TREC QA. We submitted two runs for the main QA track (AskMSR and AskMSR2).\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"Learning to Rank Non-Factoid Answers: Comment Selection in Web Forums,\" this makes me think of how challenging it is to evaluate and rank answers that aren't straightforward facts. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the methodologies and techniques researchers use in this specific area of study, it seems like there's an underlying interest in how to apply these methods in real-world scenarios, such as web forums where the quality and relevance of comments can greatly vary.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the top results focus on factoid questions and the use of VerbNet, knowledge bases, and neural networks for question answering. However, the query specifically asks about non-factoid answers, which implies a need to delve into more subjective and context-dependent evaluation criteria. The strengths of the current search terms lie in their ability to pinpoint factual information, but their weakness is the lack of consideration for the nuances of non-factoid content.\n\nTransitioning to a structured approach, I'll apply the \"Query Expansion Through Journalistic Investigation\" technique, which involves treating the query as a story that needs comprehensive research and investigation. This approach should help because it encourages a deep dive into the topic, looking for diverse real-world contexts, authoritative sources, and specific terminology that can enrich the query.\n\nStarting with the query assessment, it's clear that the user seeks practical advice on ranking non-factoid answers, specifically in the context of web forums. This requires identifying assumptions\u2014such as the assumption that non-factoid answers can be ranked using similar methods to factoid ones\u2014and knowledge gaps, like the lack of understanding of how user context and forum dynamics influence the ranking. The user's needs go beyond factual information, seeking a conceptual understanding of how to apply these ranking methods effectively.\n\nMoving into real-world contexts, non-factoid answer ranking is relevant in professional settings like customer service forums, educational environments where students discuss course materials, personal situations like social media platforms, and specialized communities such as academic or hobbyist forums. Each of these contexts presents unique challenges and requirements for what makes an answer relevant and high-quality.\n\nInvestigating resources, notable experts in natural language processing, information retrieval, and human-computer interaction are crucial. Methodologies like semantic analysis, neural networks, and user modeling are essential. Terms such as \"non-factoid answers,\" \"comment ranking,\" \"semantic analysis,\" \"neural networks,\" and \"user context\" are fundamental. Organizations like ACM, IEEE, and AAAI, and communities involved in TREC (Text Retrieval Conference) evaluations, are significant.\n\nCreating headlines for articles that could address the query from different angles helps to further refine the search terms. Examples might include \"Beyond Factoid Answers: Ranking Meaningful Comments in Online Forums,\" \"The Role of User Context in Non-Factoid Answer Ranking,\" and \"Deep Learning for Discourse: Predicting Quality and Relevance in Web Conversations.\" These headlines suggest a focus on semantic analysis, user-centric approaches, and the application of deep learning techniques.\n\nExtracting terms from these headlines and the initial query goals, we have \"non-factoid answers,\" \"comment ranking,\" \"semantic analysis,\" \"neural networks,\" \"user context,\" \"forum dynamics,\" \"discourse quality,\" \"relevance scoring,\" and \"personalized recommendations.\" These terms capture the essence of what the user is seeking\u2014practical methods and techniques for ranking non-factoid answers in web forums, considering both the content of the answers and the context in which they are given.\n\nApplying the technique systematically, I adjust my approach as I consider the complexities of non-factoid answers. For instance, realizing that semantic similarity might not always capture the nuances of human conversation, I also think about how user feedback and forum dynamics play into ranking. This leads to a reconsideration of the initial terms, ensuring they are comprehensive and relevant to the task at hand.\n\nInsights emerge from both the structured technique and intuitive connections. For example, the application of semantic analysis and neural networks leads to the discovery of specific techniques like VerbNet for understanding the syntactic and thematic information in questions and answers. However, it's also clear that incorporating user context and intent into these models is crucial for non-factoid answers, suggesting a path forward that combines deep learning with user modeling techniques.\n\nSynthesizing this information, I believe the most effective terms for a BM25 index, considering both explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, would include \"learning to rank,\" \"non-factoid answers,\" \"comment selection,\" \"web forums,\" \"semantic analysis,\" \"neural networks,\" \"user context,\" and \"personalized ranking.\" These terms reflect a deep understanding of the query, combining the original intent with valuable new insights derived from the journalistic investigation technique.",
