  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: With the existence of many large transaction databases, the huge amounts of data, the high scalability of distributed systems, and the easy partition and distribution of a centralized database, it is important to inuestzgate eficient methods for distributed mining of association rules. This study discloses some interesting relationships between locally large and globally large itemsets and proposes an interesting distributed association rule mining algorithm, FDM (Fast Distributed Mining of association rules), which generates a small number of candidate sets and substantially reduces the number of messages to be passed at mining association rules. Our performance study shows that FDM has a superior performance over the direct application of a typical sequential algorithm. Further performance enhancement leads to a few variations of the algorithm.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: We are given a large database of customer transactions, where each transaction consists of customer-id, transaction time, and the items bought in the transaction. We introduce the problem of mining sequential patterns over such databases. We present three algorithms to solve this problem, and empirically evaluate their performance using synthetic data. Two of the proposed algorithms, AprioriSome and AprioriAll, have comparable performance, albeit AprioriSome performs a little better when the minimum number of customers that must support a sequential pattern is low. Scale-up experiments show that both AprioriSome and AprioriAll scale linearly with the number of customer transactions. They also have excellent scale-up properties with respect to the number of transactions per customer and the number of items in a transaction.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: Discovery of association rules is an important database mining problem. Current algorithms for nding association rules require several passes over the analyzed database, and obviously the role of I/O overhead is very signi cant for very large databases. We present new algorithms that reduce the database activity considerably. The idea is to pick a random sample, to nd using this sample all association rules that probably hold in the whole database, and then to verify the results with the rest of the database. The algorithms thus produce exact association rules, not approximations based on a sample. The approach is, however, probabilistic, and in those rare cases where our sampling method does not produce all association rules, the missing rules can be found in a second pass. Our experiments show that the proposed algorithms can nd association rules very e ciently in only one database pass.\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"Breaking the Barrier of Transactions: Mining Inter-Transaction Association Rules,\" this makes me think of the challenges in traditional transaction mining approaches, particularly when dealing with complex patterns across multiple transactions. Though the user might actually be trying to understand how to apply advanced data mining techniques to real-world scenarios, I'm not sure yet what specific aspects of inter-transaction association rules they're interested in. The query implies a desire to move beyond simply identifying patterns within individual transactions and explore connections and dependencies across multiple transactions, which suggests they're looking for a more holistic understanding of transactional data.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the top documents discuss various algorithms and techniques for mining association rules in transactions, such as the FDM algorithm and AprioriSome. These results suggest that the user is on the right track in seeking more efficient methods for mining inter-transaction association rules. However, I also notice that the results could be improved by incorporating more context about real-world applications, time constraints, and scalability. For instance, the document at k=1 discusses the importance of distributed systems for large-scale transaction databases, which is a crucial aspect of inter-transaction association rule mining.\n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here, and I think it's time to approach this using the \"Query Expansion Through Journalistic Investigation\" technique, which involves treating the query as a story to be researched and expanded upon. This should help because it allows me to consider the query from multiple angles, identify real-world contexts, and investigate authoritative sources. By applying this technique, I can systematically break down the query into its core components, analyze the existing results, and then expand upon them to create a more comprehensive and effective search query.\n\nFollowing the journalistic investigation approach, I start by assessing the query to understand what the user is truly seeking. I identify that the user wants to understand how to overcome limitations in traditional transaction mining approaches, particularly when dealing with inter-transaction association rules. I also recognize that the user is looking for practical advice, factual information, and conceptual understanding. Next, I consider diverse real-world scenarios where this query is relevant, such as professional contexts in data mining, educational settings in computer science, and personal situations in business analytics.\n\nAs I investigate real-world contexts, I start to see connections between inter-transaction association rule mining and other areas, such as distributed computing, time-series analysis, and data visualization. For example, I realize that understanding inter-transaction associations is crucial in real-world scenarios like fraud detection, customer behavior analysis, and supply chain management. I also identify notable experts and their key contributions, established methodologies, and essential terminology related to inter-transaction association rule mining.\n\nNow, let me create some headlines that could introduce articles addressing the query from multiple angles. I come up with titles like \"Beyond Transactions: Mining Inter-Transaction Association Rules for Deeper Insights,\" \"Breaking the Barrier: Distributed Computing for Large-Scale Inter-Transaction Analysis,\" and \"Unlocking Hidden Connections: Case Studies in Real-World Inter-Transaction Rule Mining.\" These headlines help me extract specific terms related to the query, such as \"inter-transaction,\" \"association rules,\" \"distributed mining,\" \"scalability,\" and \"time constraints.\"\n\nAs I apply the journalistic investigation technique, I start to see a clearer picture of what the user is looking for. I realize that the user wants to discover effective distributed mining techniques for inter-transaction association rule discovery, with applications to time-sensitive data. I also understand that the user is interested in exploring techniques for breaking the barrier of traditional transaction mining, discovering real-world applications of inter-transaction association rule mining, and identifying specific algorithms and methods designed for this task.\n\nThrough this process of applying the journalistic investigation technique and exploring related threads, I believe the terms that would be most effective for a search query are those that capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking. The augmented query, \"Effective Distributed Mining Techniques for Inter-Transaction Association Rule Discovery with Applications to Time-Sensitive Data,\" reflects this understanding and provides a more comprehensive and effective search query.",
