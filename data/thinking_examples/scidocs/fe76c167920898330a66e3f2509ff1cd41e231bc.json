  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: We present an analysis of measuring stride-to-stride gait variability passively, in a home setting using two vision based monitoring techniques: anonymized video data from a system of two web-cameras, and depth imagery from a single Microsoft Kinect. Millions of older adults fall every year. The ability to assess the fall risk of elderly individuals is essential to allowing them to continue living safely in independent settings as they age. Studies have shown that measures of stride-to-stride gait variability are predictive of falls in older adults. For this analysis, a set of participants were asked to perform a number of short walks while being monitored by the two vision based systems, along with a marker based Vicon motion capture system for ground truth. Measures of stride-to-stride gait variability were computed using each of the systems and compared against those obtained from the Vicon.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: Analysis of human gait helps to find an intrinsic gait signature through which ubiquitous human identification and medical disorder problems can be investigated in a broad spectrum. The gait biometric provides an unobtrusive feature by which video gait data can be captured at a larger distance without prior awareness of the subject. In this paper, a new technique has been addressed to study the human gait analysis with Kinect Xbox device. It ensures us to minimize the segmentation errors with automated background subtraction technique. The closely similar human skeleton model can be generated from background subtracted gait images, altered by covariate conditions, such as change in walking speed and variations in clothing type. The gait signatures are captured from joint angle trajectories of left hip, left knee, right hip and right knee of subject's skeleton model. The experimental verification on Kinect gait data has been compared with our in-house development of sensor based biometric suit, Intelligent Gait Oscillation Detector (IGOD). An endeavor has been taken to investigate whether this sensor based biometric suit can be altered with a Kinect device for the proliferation of robust gait identification system. The Fisher discriminant analysis has been applied on training gait signature to look into the discriminatory power of feature vector. The Nai\u0308ve Bayesian classifier demonstrates an encouraging classification result with estimation of errors on limited dataset captured by Kinect sensor.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: In recent years, many user-interface devices appear for managing variety the physical interactions. The Microsft Kinect camera is a revolutionary and useful depth camera giving new user experience of interactive gaming on the Xbox platform through gesture or motion detection. In this paper we present an approach for control the Quadrotor AR.Drone using the Microsft Kinect sensor.\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"Comparative abilities of Microsoft Kinect and Vicon 3D motion capture for gait analysis,\" this makes me think of the various applications of motion capture technology in healthcare and beyond. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the technical differences and clinical applicability of these two systems, I'm not sure yet how deep they want to dive into the specifics of gait analysis or the broader implications of motion capture. \n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the initial findings highlight Kinect's cost-effectiveness and its basic capabilities for stride timing, but they also point out significant limitations in joint tracking accuracy, especially for hip and knee flexion. There are gaps in the information, particularly regarding Kinect's clinical inapplicability due to hardware and software shortcomings, and issues with occlusion. This suggests that the search terms could be enhanced to address system accuracy, technical improvements, and applications beyond gait analysis.\n\nTo approach this query expansion, I'll use the technique of contextual and conceptual expansion, focusing on introducing new dimensions that are both diverse and specific. This involves identifying ineffective terms that are too broad or non-precise, such as \"motion analysis\" or \"general tutorials,\" and avoiding them in the augmented query. \n\nMy first step is to elucidate the primary objectives and gaps in the original query. The main goal is to compare the abilities of Microsoft Kinect and Vicon 3D motion capture systems for gait analysis, with particular attention to their technical accuracy, clinical applicability, and potential for improvement or application in other areas. The gaps include the need for more precise technical comparisons, especially in terms of system accuracy and the handling of occlusion issues, as well as exploring non-clinical applications of these technologies.\n\nNext, I identify ineffective terms that should be avoided. These include broad terms like \"motion analysis,\" \"lecture videos,\" \"general tutorials,\" and \"unvalidated studies,\" as they do not contribute to a precise and targeted search for comparative information on Microsoft Kinect and Vicon for gait analysis.\n\nFor breadth expansion, I consider terms that introduce new but related concepts. These could include \"cost-effective motion tracking,\" \"real-time data processing,\" \"robotic rehabilitation,\" \"multi-sensor systems,\" and \"markerless human-body tracking.\" These terms expand the search to encompass related technologies and applications without straying too far from the core comparison of interest.\n\nIn depth expansion, I choose a key area from the breadth expansion, such as \"markerless human-body tracking,\" and delve deeper into related terms. This could involve exploring \"dual-Kinect sensor fusion,\" \"Kalman filter implementation for occlusion handling,\" and \"upper-body robotic programming verification.\" These terms help to refine the search, focusing on specific technologies and methodologies that enhance the comparison between Microsoft Kinect and Vicon, particularly in addressing the limitations and potential improvements of these systems.\n\nAs I apply this expansion technique, I also allow for natural thought patterns to emerge, including reconsiderations, intuitive leaps, and connections to related concepts. For instance, considering the use of dual-Kinect sensors reminds me of the potential for improved accuracy in tracking and the possibility of applying similar principles to other types of motion capture systems. Similarly, exploring Kalman filter implementations for handling occlusion issues leads me to think about the broader applications of such filtering techniques in signal processing and data analysis.\n\nThrough this process of structured expansion and organic thinking, insights begin to emerge. The application of specific techniques, like dual-Kinect sensor fusion, leads to discoveries about potential improvements in motion capture accuracy. Intuitive connections to related concepts, such as the use of Kalman filters in other contexts, suggest pathways for further exploration and potential innovation in the field.\n\nSynthesizing these insights with clarity, I believe the most effective terms for a BM25 index would include those that capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking in the comparison between Microsoft Kinect and Vicon for gait analysis. These terms should reflect the technical, clinical, and innovative dimensions of motion capture technology, ensuring a search that is both targeted and expansive, capable of revealing not just comparative analyses but also potential breakthroughs and applications in the field.",
