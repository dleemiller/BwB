  "reasoning": "The current search results are strong in showcasing advanced natural language processing techniques for question answering but fall short in addressing the story generation aspect, which is crucial to the original query. The main goal should be to bridge this gap by incorporating elements that relate to both narrative generation and how question-answering systems can function within them. By identifying ineffective terms like 'methodologies' or 'techniques,' which are too broad or generic for our needs, we can focus on more specific concepts such as 'narrative structures' or 'interactive storytelling.' Breadth expansion should introduce broader but related fields such as computational creativity and narrative theory, while depth exploration might delve into specifics like 'story arcs in AI-generated narratives' or 'contextual question-answering within plots.' This multi-layered approach ensures that the augmented query covers novel dimensions of both story generation and QA integration.",

  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: Opinion question answering is a challenging task for natural language processing. In this paper, we discuss a necessary component for an opinion question answering system: separating opinions from fact, at both the document and sentence level. We present a Bayesian classifier for discriminating between documents with a preponderance of opinions such as editorials from regular news stories, and describe three unsupervised, statistical techniques for the significantly harder task of detecting opinions at the sentence level. We also present a first model for classifying opinion sentences as positive or negative in terms of the main perspective being expressed in the opinion. Results from a large collection of news stories and a human evaluation of 400 sentences are reported, indicating that we achieve very high performance in document classification (upwards of 97% precision and recall), and respectable performance in detecting opinions and classifying them at the sentence level as positive, negative, or neutral (up to 91% accuracy).\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: An interactive Question Answering (QA) system frequently encounters non-sentential (incomplete) questions. These non-sentential questions may not make sense to the system when a user asks them without the context of conversation. The system thus needs to take into account the conversation context to process the incomplete question. In this work, we present a recurrent neural network (RNN) based encoder decoder network that can generate a complete (intended) question, given an incomplete question and conversation context. RNN encoder decoder networks have been show to work well when trained on a parallel corpus with millions of sentences, however it is extremely hard to obtain conversation data of this magnitude. We therefore propose to decompose the original problem into two separate simplified problems where each problem focuses on an abstraction. Specifically, we train a semantic sequence model to learn semantic patterns, and a syntactic sequence model to learn linguistic patterns. We further combine syntactic and semantic sequence models to generate an ensemble model. Our model achieves a BLEU score of 30.15 as compared to 18.54 using a standard RNN encoder decoder model.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: As machines have become more intelligent, there has been a renewed interest in methods for measuring their intelligence. A common approach is to propose tasks for which a human excels, but one which machines find difficult. However, an ideal task should also be easy to evaluate and not be easily gameable. We begin with a case study exploring the recently popular task of image captioning and its limitations as a task for measuring machine intelligence. An alternative and more promising task is Visual Question Answering that tests a machine\u2019s ability to reason about language and vision. We describe a dataset unprecedented in size created for the task that contains over 760,000 human generated questions about images. Using around 10 million human generated answers, machines may be easily evaluated.\n",
  "thought_process": "As I delve into the original query, \"Question Answering in the Context of Stories Generated by Computers,\" my initial impression is that this is a highly specialized and innovative area of research, combining elements of natural language processing, artificial intelligence, and narrative generation. The query suggests a need to understand how question-answering systems can be integrated into computer-generated stories, which implies a deep exploration of both the technical capabilities of AI in generating coherent narratives and the cognitive aspects of how humans interact with these stories.\n\nAnalyzing the initial results, I notice that while they touch upon advanced natural language processing techniques and question-answering systems, there's a significant gap in addressing the story generation aspect directly. The text snippets provided showcase the complexity of natural language processing tasks, such as opinion question answering, handling non-sentential questions in interactive QA systems, and visual question answering. However, they don't explicitly explore the integration of QA within narratives generated by computers.\n\nTo bridge this gap, I'll apply the expansion technique, which involves a systematic approach to discover new, relevant documents across various domains. The first step is goal elucidation and gap identification. The primary objective here is to integrate story generation with question answering, exploring how QA systems can function within computer-generated narratives. A significant gap in the current query is the lack of specific terms related to narrative structures, interactive storytelling, and computational creativity.\n\nNext, I identify ineffective terms that are too broad or generic, such as 'methodologies' and 'techniques,' which do not contribute significantly to the specificity of the query. Instead, focusing on terms like 'narrative structures,' 'interactive storytelling,' and 'computational creativity' could provide a more targeted approach.\n\nFor breadth expansion, I consider terms that introduce broader but related fields. This includes 'computational creativity,' 'narrative theory,' 'interactive storytelling,' and 'AI narrative generation.' These terms expand the query to cover novel dimensions of both story generation and QA integration without overlapping with the original terms.\n\nMoving on to depth expansion, I select a distant but important topic from the breadth expansion, such as 'narrative structures in AI-generated stories,' and delve deeper into related terms. This could include 'story arcs in AI-generated narratives,' 'contextual question-answering within plots,' 'emotional intelligence in story-based QA systems,' and 'narrative coherence and character development in automated stories.' These terms provide a layered approach, ensuring the query covers both the technical and cognitive aspects of integrating QA into computer-generated narratives.\n\nThrough this structured approach, complemented by natural thought patterns and intuitive connections, I've identified key terms that can enhance the original query. The augmented query, focusing on story arcs, contextual question answering, emotional intelligence, and narrative coherence in automated storytelling, captures the essence of integrating QA into computer-generated narratives. This approach not only systematically applies the expansion technique but also incorporates natural cognitive elements, such as reconsidering initial impressions and making intuitive leaps between related concepts.\n\nThe final augmented query emerges as a synthesis of structured technique and natural insight, aiming to capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking. By balancing systematic expansion with cognitive patterns, the query is refined to include targeted terms that are diverse, unique, and contextually relevant, ensuring a comprehensive exploration of question answering in the context of stories generated by computers.",
