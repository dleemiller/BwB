  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n... Despite the positive effects of EMR usage in medical practices, the adoption rate of such systems is still low and meets resistance from physicians. This systematic review reveals that physicians may face a range of barriers when they approach EMR implementation. We conclude that the process of EMR implementation should be treated as a change project, and led by implementers or change managers, in medical practices. The quality of change management plays an important role in the success of EMR implementation. The barriers and suggested interventions highlighted in this study are intended to act as a reference for implementers of Electronic Medical Records. A careful diagnosis of the specific situation is required before relevant interventions can be determined.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: Business Intelligence (BI) is on everyone's lips nowadays, since it provides businesses with the possibility to analyze their business practices and improve them. However, Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) often cannot leverage the positive effects of BI because of missing resources like personnel, knowledge, or money. Since SME pose a major form of business organization, this fact has to be overcome. As the retail industry is a substantial part of the SME branch, we propose an inter-organizational approach for a BI system for retail SME, which allows them to collaboratively collect data and perform analysis task. The aim of our ongoing research effort is the development of such a system following the Design Science Research Methodology. Within this article, the status quo of current BI practices in SME in the retail industry is analyzed through qualitative interviews with ten SME managers. Afterwards, adoption and success factors of BI systems and Inter-organizational Information Systems are worked out in a comprehensive structured literature review. Based on the status quo and the adoption and success factors, first requirements for the acceptance of an inter-organizational BI system are identified and validated in another round of qualitative interviews. This leads to nine functional requirements and three non-functional requirements, which can be used for designing and implementing an inter-organizational BI system for SME in the following research efforts.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: We begin with a retrospective reflection on the first author\u2019s research career, which in large part is devoted to research about the implications of information technology (IT) for organizational change. Although IT has long been associated with organizational change, our historical review of the treatment of technology in organization theory demonstrates how easily the material aspects of organizations can disappear into the backwaters of theory development. This is an unfortunate result since the material characteristics of IT initiatives distinguish them from other organizational change initiatives. Our aim is to restore materiality to studies of IT impact by tracing the reasons for its disappearance and by offering options in which IT\u2019s materiality plays a more central theoretical role. We adopt a socio-technical perspective that differs from a strict sociomaterial perspective insofar as we wish to preserve the ontological distinction between material artifacts and their social context of use. Our analysis proceeds using the concept of \u201caffordance\u201d as a relational concept consistent with the socio-technical perspective. We then propose extensions of organizational routines theory that incorporate material artifacts in the generative system known as routines. These contributions exemplify two of the many challenges inherent in adopting materiality as a new research focus in the study of IT\u2019s organizational impacts.\n",
  "thought_process": "As I delve into the query \"Enablers and Barriers to the Organizational Adoption of Sustainable Business Practices,\" my initial thoughts are centered around what this question truly seeks. It's not just about understanding the straightforward hindrances and facilitators but also about grasping the nuances of why organizations adopt or reject sustainable practices. This makes me think of personal stories and experiences from business leaders, the emotional and psychological aspects of decision-making in this context, and how these factors interplay with more tangible elements like policy, technology, and economic incentives.\n\nLooking at the initial results from the query, I see a range of topics being discussed, from the adoption of Electronic Medical Records (EMR) to the implementation of Business Intelligence (BI) in Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), and reflections on the role of materiality in organizational change due to information technology. These texts highlight various barriers and enablers, such as resistance from physicians, lack of resources in SMEs, and the importance of change management and material aspects of technology in organizational routines.\n\nTo approach the expansion of this query systematically, I will use the technique of analyzing community Q&A patterns. This involves reframing the original query into more relatable and engaging forms that would elicit practical and diverse responses from a community. The steps include question reframing, identifying hidden motivations behind the query, categorizing valuable response patterns, mapping community interactions, and extracting vocabulary from these interactions.\n\nStarting with question reframing, I consider how the original query could be personalized or made more conversational. For example, \"What are the most significant challenges you've faced when trying to implement sustainable practices in your organization?\" or \"How did you overcome resistance to sustainability initiatives within your company?\" These reframed questions are designed to solicit personal experiences and advice, which are invaluable for understanding the real-world implementation of sustainable business practices.\n\nNext, I identify the hidden motivations behind the query, such as seeking validation, practical advice, insider knowledge, diverse perspectives, or emotional support. Recognizing these motivations helps in crafting an expanded query that meets the user's underlying needs. For instance, if the user is seeking reassurance, the expanded query might include terms related to success stories or best practices in sustainability adoption.\n\nThe technique also involves analyzing answer archetypes, such as first-person narratives, expert opinions, step-by-step advice, contrarian viewpoints, and nuanced responses. These archetypes help in understanding the types of responses that would be most valuable to the user and in extracting relevant terminology from such responses.\n\nFurthermore, mapping community interactions, such as follow-up questions, debates, and requests for clarification, provides insights into how discussions around sustainability evolve and what aspects are most contentious or in need of further exploration. This helps in identifying gaps in knowledge or understanding that the expanded query could address.\n\nFinally, extracting vocabulary from these interactions involves looking at the language used in questions, answers, and discussions. This includes emotional and subjective language, personal context descriptions, informal explanations, qualification patterns, and community-specific jargon. By incorporating this vocabulary into the expanded query, it becomes more reflective of how people naturally discuss and seek information on sustainable business practices in community settings.\n\nThrough this process, the expanded query emerges as a culmination of systematic analysis and natural thought patterns. It is enriched with terms and phrases that capture the essence of real-world discussions and concerns related to the adoption of sustainable business practices. The final expanded query, including terms like \"real-world implementation challenges,\" \"cultural resistance,\" \"stakeholder alignment,\" \"practical strategies,\" and \"leadership commitment,\" reflects a balance between structured technique and intuitive understanding of community dynamics and user needs.\n\nThis approach to query expansion not only enhances the chances of retrieving relevant information but also ensures that the search results resonate with the user's actual concerns and questions, providing a more holistic and supportive response to their query.",
