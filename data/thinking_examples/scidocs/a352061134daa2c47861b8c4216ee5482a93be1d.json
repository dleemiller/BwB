  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: Purpose \u2013 The purpose of this paper is to propose a business process management (BPM) governance model that sets BPM decision making, along with roles and responsibilities. The setting context of the study is a government-owned corporation operating in Australia. Design/methodology/approach \u2013 A qualitative case study examined and analysed organisational documents using a content analysis approach. Results of document analysis are used to inform a series of in-depth interviews of key stakeholders in the organisation. Interviews are analysed using a constant comparison method to derive themes and build categories of description. Findings \u2013 A BPM governance model is proposed. Results of thematic analysis are interpreted against the framework of the BPM governance model, leading to findings that include implications for theory and practice. Practical implications \u2013 In practical terms, the research shows how BPM practice can be aligned and integrated with the corporate governance and management systems in the selected case study organisation. Originality/value \u2013 Despite research identifying the importance of governance, along with associated capabilities, there has been little progress on how the abovementioned capabilities can be effectively deployed across an organisation. This paper addresses a gap in the literature relating to how to deploy BPM governance in an organisation.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: IT Governance becomes a key component in corporative governance because of the influence of information systems and technologies that support every component of the organization. IT governance which is applied to government organizations can provide positive benefits and support the achievement of business objectives to increase the quality of public services. Application of a good IT Governance is used to apply it in accordance with institutional context. The method used is COBIT 5 combined with ITBSC, then mapping with institutional objectives. The process of collecting data using structured interview methods to the stakeholders in Kupang Municipality. This research found that capability level of Kupang Municipality is in position 0 (incomplete process) with target level of capability of 3, it means that IT Governance of Kupang Municipality not in a maximal condition to responding business process. This study also produced a recommendation for improvement in order to increase the value of capability levels that were set based on COBIT 5.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: T he articles in this issue ofDATA BASE were chosen b y Anthony G .

  "thought_process": "As I begin to consider the original query, \"BPM Governance: An Exploratory Study in Public Organizations,\" my initial impression is that this topic is quite complex and intersects with multiple disciplines. It makes me think of the challenges that public organizations face in implementing effective business process management (BPM) systems, and how governance plays a crucial role in this context. However, I'm also aware that the user might be trying to explore more than just the surface-level aspects of BPM governance, possibly seeking insights into how IT governance, regulatory constraints, historical context, and organizational culture influence the success of BPM initiatives in public organizations.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the top documents provide valuable insights but may not fully capture the breadth of the topic. For instance, the first document proposes a BPM governance model for a government-owned corporation, highlighting the importance of aligning BPM decision-making with roles and responsibilities. The second document discusses the application of IT governance in a government organization, emphasizing its role in supporting business objectives and improving public services. These results suggest that governance, whether BPM or IT, is crucial for the effective management of public organizations, but they also hint at the complexity and specificity of implementing such systems in the public sector.\n\nTo expand this query effectively, I decide to employ the \"Query Expansion via Multi-Disciplinary Expert Panel\" technique. This approach involves convening a panel of experts from diverse disciplines relevant to BPM governance in public organizations, including technical, academic, practical, historical, and social disciplines. Each expert will bring their unique insights, methodologies, and specialized vocabulary to the table, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the topic.\n\nThe first step is to select the experts. I identify five relevant disciplines and create expert personas with specific credentials and experience. For the technical discipline, I choose Dr. Alex Thompson, an Information Systems Professor with a focus on business process management. For the academic discipline, I select Prof. Emily Wang, a Historian focusing on the evolution of public sector administration and technology adoption. Ms. Clara Johnson, a Public Sector IT Governance Consultant, represents the practical discipline. Mr. Liam Patel, a Business Analyst with expertise in BPM implementation across industries, brings a cross-industry perspective. Lastly, Dr. Sarah Lee, a Sociologist studying the impact of governance frameworks on organizational culture, provides insights from the social sciences.\n\nEach expert analyzes the query from their disciplinary perspective, identifying key concepts, methodologies, and specialized vocabulary. They note what the original query might be overlooking from their expertise. For instance, Dr. Thompson suggests exploring the alignment between BPM frameworks and existing IT governance models to identify gaps specific to public organizations. Ms. Johnson emphasizes the importance of understanding regulatory constraints in the public sector that affect BPM implementation and governance. Mr. Patel recommends examining case studies from both private and public sectors to draw comparisons in BPM adoption challenges and successes.\n\nThe panel discussion reveals cross-disciplinary connections and highlights complementary tools and frameworks. The experts clarify terminology differences between fields, ensuring a cohesive understanding of BPM governance. They identify areas where their disciplines overlap and how these overlaps can provide a more comprehensive view of the topic. For example, the link between IT governance models and BPM frameworks helps address technological constraints and opportunities specific to the public sector environment. Historical context provides a foundation for understanding current challenges in BPM governance, while comparative studies between sectors can reveal unique barriers and best practices applicable to the public domain.\n\nThrough this structured approach, combined with the organic thinking and natural cognitive patterns that emerged during the panel discussions, several key insights emerge. The importance of IT governance alignment, regulatory constraints, historical context, organizational culture, and cross-disciplinary methodologies becomes clear. These elements are not just crucial for understanding BPM governance in public organizations but also for formulating an effective search query that can uncover relevant resources and dimensions not covered by existing documents.\n\nThe final step is synthesizing the insights into an expanded query. By compiling specialized terminology from all experts and identifying terms with cross-disciplinary relevance, I prioritize terms that add new dimensions to the search. The expanded query, \"BPM Governance: An Exploratory Study in Public Organizations, focusing on IT governance alignment, regulatory constraints, historical context, organizational culture, comparative case studies between public and private sectors, and cross-disciplinary methodologies,\" encapsulates the broader scope of BPM governance and is designed to uncover a wide range of relevant resources.\n\nThrough this process of applying the \"Query Expansion via Multi-Disciplinary Expert Panel\" technique and exploring related threads, I believe the terms identified in the expanded query would be most effective for a BM25 index. They capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, combining the structured approach of the technique with the natural cognitive patterns and intuitive connections that emerged during the expert panel discussion.",
