  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: We describe an approach to building security services for context-aware environments. Specifically, we focus on the design of security services that incorporate the use of security-relevant \u201ccontext\u201d to provide flexible access control and policy enforcement. We previously presented a generalized access control model that makes significant use of contextual information in policy definition. This document provides a concrete realization of such a model by presenting a system-level service architecture, as well as early implementation experience with the framework. Through our context-aware security services, our system architecture offers enhanced authentication services, more flexible access control and a security subsystem that can adapt itself based on current conditions in the environment. We discuss our architecture and implementation and show how it can be used to secure several sample applications.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: Pervasive computing is becoming a reality due to the rise of the so-called Internet of Things (IoT). In this paradigm, everyday and physical objects are being equipped with capabilities to detect and communicate information they receive from their environment, turning them into smart objects. However, such entities are usually deployed on environments with changing and dynamic conditions, which can be used by them to modify their operation or behavior. Under the foundations of EU FP7 SocIoTal project, this work provides an overview about how contextual information can be taken into account by smart objects when making security decisions, by considering such information as a first-class component, in order to realize the so-called context-aware security on IoT scenarios.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: The Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) is a novel routing protocol standardized for constrained environments such as 6LoWPAN networks. Providing security in IPv6/RPL connected 6LoWPANs is challenging because the devices are connected to the untrusted Internet and are resource constrained, the communication links are lossy, and the devices use a set of novel IoT technologies such as RPL, 6LoWPAN, and CoAP/CoAPs. In this paper we provide a comprehensive analysis of IoT technologies and their new security capabilities that can be exploited by attackers or IDSs. One of the major contributions in this paper is our implementation and demonstration of well-known routing attacks against 6LoWPAN networks running RPL as a routing protocol. We implement these attacks in the RPL implementation in the Contiki operating system and demonstrate these attacks in the Cooja simulator. Furthermore, we highlight novel security features in the IPv6 protocol and exemplify the use of these features for intrusion detection in the IoT by implementing a lightweight heartbeat protocol.\n",
  "thought_process": "As I delve into the query \"Providing Context-Aware Security for IoT Environments Through Context Sharing Feature,\" my initial impression is that this is a highly specialized topic within the broader realm of cybersecurity and IoT. The user's interest in \"context-aware security\" and \"context sharing\" suggests a deep dive into how security can be enhanced in IoT environments by leveraging the context in which devices and systems operate. My first association is with the concept of situational awareness in cybersecurity, where understanding the environment and the situation of the devices and users can significantly enhance security measures.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, it's clear that while there's a strong foundation of knowledge on context-aware security in IoT, the specific aspect of \"context sharing\" as a feature for enhancing security is less explored. The existing results provide a good starting point, discussing access control, policy enforcement, and the use of contextual information for security decisions. However, to truly augment the query and uncover more relevant information, we need to dig deeper into the historical evolution of context sharing, its current state, and emerging trends.\n\nThis is where the expansion technique of Temporal Evolution Analysis comes into play. By analyzing how the topic of context-aware security and context sharing has evolved over time, we can identify key milestones, foundational concepts, and emerging trends that will inform our query expansion. The process involves tracing the historical foundation of context-aware security, identifying developmental milestones, assessing the current landscape, projecting emerging horizons, and extracting temporal terms that represent the topic's full temporal spectrum.\n\nAs I apply this technique, I start by considering the historical foundation. Early access control models like Discretionary Access Control (DAC) and Mandatory Access Control (MAC) laid the groundwork for more complex security systems. The concept of situation-aware computing and pervasive computing security challenges also contributed to the development of context-aware security. It's interesting to note how these early concepts have evolved, with proximity-based authorization and early sensor networks security being precursors to the more sophisticated context-aware systems we see today.\n\nIn terms of developmental milestones, the development of context-aware middleware platforms, the introduction of policy-based context-aware security, and standardization efforts like ISO 24760 have been crucial. The emergence of attribute-based access control (ABAC) and the development of security frameworks for IoT have also played significant roles in shaping the current landscape of context-aware security.\n\nThe current landscape is marked by advancements in context-aware access control in IoT, secure context dissemination protocols, and context sharing platforms for smart environments. Technologies like blockchain for secure context sharing, edge-based context processing, and privacy-preserving context sharing techniques are gaining traction. Additionally, the integration of AI for risk assessment based on shared context and the adoption of Zero-Trust Architectures incorporating context are indicative of the field's rapid evolution.\n\nLooking ahead to emerging trends, federated learning for context model training, homomorphic encryption for context processing, and differential privacy for context dissemination are areas of significant interest. Decentralized identity and context management, context-aware security orchestration and automation, and the use of digital twins and context virtualization are also on the horizon. Quantum-resistant context sharing protocols will become increasingly important as quantum computing becomes more prevalent.\n\nThrough this process, I've identified a range of terms that capture the historical, current, and future aspects of context-aware security and context sharing in IoT. Terms like \"secure context dissemination,\" \"privacy-preserving context sharing,\" \"distributed trust management,\" and \"federated identity\" are crucial for understanding the contemporary state of the field. Including temporal terms such as \"early,\" \"recent,\" \"emerging,\" and \"next-generation\" will help refine the search, ensuring that the results span the full spectrum of the topic's evolution.\n\nAs I synthesize this information, it becomes clear that the augmented query needs to balance the specificity of context-aware security and context sharing with the breadth of temporal evolution. By incorporating terms that reflect the historical foundation, developmental milestones, current landscape, and emerging trends, we can create a query that not only captures the current state of knowledge but also anticipates future developments.\n\nThe final step is to ensure that the expanded query logically emerges from both the structured technique of Temporal Evolution Analysis and the natural insights gleaned from exploring the topic. The inclusion of terms like \"context-aware security,\" \"IoT,\" \"context sharing,\" along with the more specialized terms identified through the analysis, will provide a comprehensive search that uncovers relevant information across the spectrum of the topic's evolution.\n\nIn conclusion, the thought process behind expanding the query involves a deep dive into the topic, leveraging a structured approach like Temporal Evolution Analysis, and balancing this with natural cognitive patterns that allow for intuitive connections and insights. The result is an augmented query that is both comprehensive and targeted, capturing the essence of context-aware security and context sharing in IoT environments.",
