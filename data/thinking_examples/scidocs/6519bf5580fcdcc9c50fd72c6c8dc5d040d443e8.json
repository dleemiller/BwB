  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: AmbiMax is an energy harvesting circuit and a supercapacitor based energy storage system for wireless sensor nodes (WSN). Previous WSNs attempt to harvest energy from various sources, and some also use supercapacitors instead of batteries to address the battery aging problem. However, they either waste much available energy due to impedance mismatch, or they require active digital control that incurs overhead, or they work with only one specific type of source. AmbiMax addresses these problems by first performing maximum power point tracking (MPPT) autonomously, and then charges supercapacitors at maximum efficiency. Furthermore, AmbiMax is modular and enables composition of multiple energy harvesting sources including solar, wind, thermal, and vibration, each with a different optimal size. Experimental results on a real WSN platform, Eco, show that AmbiMax successfully manages multiple power sources simultaneously and autonomously at several times the efficiency of the current state-of-the-art for WSNs\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: To sustain perpetual operation, systems that harvest environmental energy must carefully regulate their usage to satisfy their demand. Regulating energy usage is challenging if a system's demands are not elastic and its hardware components are not energy-proportional, since it cannot precisely scale its usage to match its supply. Instead, the system must choose when to satisfy its energy demands based on its current energy reserves and predictions of its future energy supply. In this paper, we explore the use of weather forecasts to improve a system's ability to satisfy demand by improving its predictions. We analyze weather forecast, observational, and energy harvesting data to formulate a model that translates a weather forecast to a wind or solar energy harvesting prediction, and quantify its accuracy. We evaluate our model for both energy sources in the context of two different energy harvesting sensor systems with inelastic demands: a sensor testbed that leases sensors to external users and a lexicographically fair sensor network that maintains steady node sensing rates. We show that using weather forecasts in both wind- and solar-powered sensor systems increases each system's ability to satisfy its demands compared with existing prediction strategies.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: In this letter, a broadband bent triangular omnidirectional antenna is presented for RF energy harvesting. The antenna has a bandwidth for VSWR \u2264 2 from 850 MHz to 1.94 GHz. The antenna is designed to receive both horizontal and vertical polarized waves and has a stable radiation pattern over the entire bandwidth. Antenna has also been optimized for energy harvesting application and it is designed for 100 \u03a9 input impedance to provide a passive voltage amplification and impedance matching to the rectifier. A peak efficiency of 60% and 17% is obtained for a load of 500 \u03a9 at 980 and 1800 MHz, respectively. At a cell site while harvesting all bands simultaneously a voltage of 3.76 V for open circuit and 1.38 V across a load of 4.3 k \u03a9 is obtained at a distance of 25 m using an array of two elements of the rectenna.\n",
  "thought_process": "As I begin to tackle the task of expanding the query \"A survey of multi-source energy harvesting systems,\" my initial impression is that the user is seeking a comprehensive overview of how different energy sources can be combined and managed efficiently. However, the phrase \"multi-source energy harvesting systems\" is quite broad, making it challenging to pinpoint the exact areas of interest. The original query results, such as the AmbiMax energy harvesting circuit and the use of weather forecasts to improve energy harvesting predictions, provide valuable insights into specific aspects of multi-source energy harvesting but lack a broad, system-level perspective.\n\nAnalyzing the initial results, it becomes clear that the query could benefit from clarification and expansion. Terms like \"survey\" are too generic and do not contribute much to the precision of the search. The task outcomes, including the identification of query goals such as overview, integration strategies, challenges, design principles, and application case studies, offer a structured approach to understanding what the user might be looking for.\n\nTo enhance the query, I will apply a structured technique that involves several steps, including goal elucidation, ineffective term identification, breadth expansion, and depth expansion. This technique, which we can refer to as \"Contextual Expansion Methodology,\" aims to introduce new dimensions to the query by focusing on targeted expansions that are both specific and diverse.\n\nStarting with goal elucidation, it's essential to understand that the primary objectives of the query are to explore multi-source energy harvesting systems, their integration, challenges, and design principles. The gaps in the original query include the lack of specificity regarding the type of energy sources, the level of integration, and the application domains.\n\nIneffective term identification reveals that terms like \"survey\" should be avoided due to their broadness and lack of precision. Instead, more specific terms related to energy management, hybrid systems, and power electronics could be more beneficial.\n\nFor breadth expansion, considering terms that are increasingly distant from the original query but still relevant can help. This includes concepts like energy management, power electronics, hybrid systems, wireless power transfer, microgrid, distributed energy resources, and optimization algorithms. Each of these terms opens up new avenues for exploration, such as the integration of different energy sources, the role of power electronics in efficiency, and the potential of wireless power transfer in reducing infrastructure needs.\n\nDepth expansion involves choosing one of these distant but important topics and delving deeper. For instance, taking the topic of \"power electronics\" and exploring it further could involve terms like power management, voltage regulation, current matching, maximum power point tracking, energy storage, and load balancing. These terms are crucial for understanding how multi-source energy harvesting systems can be optimized for efficiency and reliability.\n\nAs I apply this technique, I notice that the process not only systematically expands the query but also invites intuitive connections and reconsiderations. For example, the exploration of power electronics and its subtopics reminds me of the importance of energy storage in stabilizing the output of intermittent energy sources. This, in turn, suggests that terms related to battery management systems and supercapacitors could be valuable additions to the query.\n\nThe synthesis of these insights leads to the formulation of an augmented query that captures both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking. By combining terms from the depth expansion with other high-relevance terms, we can create a query that is not only precise but also comprehensive.\n\nThrough this process of applying the Contextual Expansion Methodology and exploring related threads, I believe the terms that would be most effective for a BM25 index include multi-source energy management, hybrid systems, voltage regulation, current matching, maximum power point tracking, wireless power transfer, and related terms from the depth expansion. These terms capture the essence of multi-source energy harvesting systems, from the integration of different energy sources to the optimization of power output, and represent a significant improvement over the original query.",
