  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: The present research seeks to extend existing theory on self-disclosure to the online arena in higher educational institutions and contribute to the knowledge base and understanding about the use of a popular social networking site (SNS), Facebook, by college students. We conducted a non-experimental study to investigate how university students (N = 463) use Facebook, and examined the roles that personality and culture play in disclosure of information in online SNS-based environments. Results showed that individuals do disclose differently online vs. in-person, and that both culture and personality matter. Specifically, it was found that collectivistic individuals low on extraversion and interacting in an online environment disclosed the least honest and the most audience-relevant information, as compared to others. Exploratory analyses also indicate that students use sites such as Facebook primarily to maintain existing personal relationships and selectively used privacy settings to control their self-presentation on SNSs. The findings of this study offer insight into understanding college students\u2019 self-disclosure on SNS, add to the literature on personality and self-disclosure, and shape future directions for research and practice on online self-presentation. Published by Elsevier Ltd.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: Large numbers of college students have become avid Facebook users in a short period of time. In this paper, we explore whether these students are using Facebook to find new people in their offline communities or to learn more about people they initially meet offline. Our data suggest that users are largely employing Facebook to learn more about people they meet offline, and are less likely to use the site to initiate new connections.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: The fields of learning theory and instructional design are in the midst of a scientific revolution in which their objectivist philosophical foundations are being replaced by a constructivist epistemology. This article describes the assumptions of a constructivist epistemology, contrasts them with objectivist assumptions, and then describes instructional systems that can support constructive learning at a distance Limitations of Distance Learning Technologies In an effort to supplement or replace live face-to-face instruction, technologicany mediated distance learning has more often than not merely replicated the ineffective methods that limit learning in face-to-face classrooms (Turoff 1995). Too often, potentially interactive technologies are used to present one-way lectures to students in remote locations. However, we believe that the most valuable activity in a classroom of any kind is the opportunity for students to work and interact together and to build and become part of a community of scholars and practitioners (Selfe and Eilola 1989; Bates 1990; Seaton 1993; Nalley 1995). ...\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"Students' perceptions of using Facebook as an interactive learning resource at university,\" this makes me think of how social media has become an integral part of students' lives and how educational institutions are trying to leverage this to enhance learning experiences. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the effectiveness of Facebook as a tool for interactive learning, I'm not sure yet what specific aspects of this they're most interested in\u2014whether it's the technological, social, or pedagogical implications.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the documents relate to educational technology, economic aspects of higher education, student activism, and open educational resources (OER). The strengths of these results include providing a comprehensive view of interconnected topics like technology's role in modern education and initiatives such as MOOCs. However, the fragmentation and lack of detailed context or source attribution weaken the analysis on efficacy and impact. For instance, the text snippets from the documents at k=1 and k=2 offer insights into how students use Facebook for self-disclosure and relationship maintenance, but they don't directly address the query's focus on interactive learning.\n\nTo expand this query effectively, I'll apply the \"Query Expansion Through Journalistic Investigation\" technique, which involves treating the query as a story to be researched and expanded upon. This approach will help uncover real-world terms and concepts related to the query. First, I assess the query to identify what the user is truly seeking\u2014understanding students' perceptions of Facebook as an interactive learning tool. This involves recognizing assumptions (e.g., that Facebook is used primarily for social rather than educational purposes), knowledge gaps (e.g., the lack of data on academic outcomes), and unexpressed needs (e.g., understanding the economic implications of integrating Facebook into university curricula).\n\nNext, I consider real-world contexts where this query is relevant, including professional (educational technology specialists), educational (university instructors), personal (students), and specialized community (educational researchers) settings. Identifying diverse scenarios helps in understanding the multifaceted nature of the query. For example, in a professional context, educators might be interested in how Facebook can be used to enhance student engagement, while in an educational setting, the focus might be on integrating Facebook into the curriculum to support interactive learning.\n\nThe resource investigation phase involves identifying authoritative sources on this topic, such as experts in educational technology, methodologies for integrating social media into learning environments, essential terminology like \"social learning theory\" and \"interactive learning resources,\" and organizations involved in promoting the use of technology in education. Notable experts and their contributions, such as research on the effectiveness of social media in education, are also crucial. This step is about grounding the query in reality, making it more specific and actionable. For instance, exploring the work of experts like Dr. Rebecca Eynon, who has researched the impact of social media on learning outcomes, could provide valuable insights into the query.\n\nCreating diverse headlines that could introduce articles addressing the query from multiple angles helps in extracting specific terms related to the query. These headlines might include \"Exploring Students\u2019 Views: How Effective Is Facebook as an Educational Platform?\" or \"Beyond Social Media: Can Facebook Enhance Interactive Learning at Universities?\" These headlines not only reflect the query's intent but also suggest potential areas of investigation, such as the comparison of Facebook with other educational technologies or the economic analysis of integrating social media into higher education.\n\nAs I apply the \"Query Expansion Through Journalistic Investigation\" technique, I systematically go through its steps, but I also allow for natural thought patterns to emerge. This includes having occasional false starts or reconsiderations, making intuitive connections that complement the technique, and taking brief tangents that sometimes yield unexpected insights. For example, while considering the economic impact of using Facebook in education, I might realize the importance of also looking into the privacy and security concerns related to using social media platforms in academic settings. This realization could lead to exploring additional terms such as \"data protection in educational technology\" or \"cybersecurity in social learning environments.\"\n\nThrough this process, insights emerge from both the structured approach and natural intuition. Applying the technique leads to the discovery of specific terms like \"Facebook Educational Portal\" and \"educational technology integration,\" while my instinct suggests considering the broader implications of social media on student learning behaviors and outcomes. The combination of these insights helps in synthesizing the information with clarity, pointing towards the most effective terms for expanding the query.\n\nIn conclusion, by applying the \"Query Expansion Through Journalistic Investigation\" technique and balancing it with natural cognitive patterns, I believe the terms that would be most effective for a BM25 index are those that capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking. These include terms related to the use of Facebook in educational settings, interactive learning resources, student perceptions of social media, and the economic and technological aspects of integrating Facebook into university education.\n\n[[ ## completed",
