  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: In 2008, the Office of Sustainability started the Sustainability Advisors program, in which teachers invite a peer educator to give a lecture covering sustainability concepts.[128]\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: Sustainable sanitation considers the entire \"sanitation value chain\", from the experience of the user, excreta and wastewater collection methods, transportation or conveyance of waste, treatment, and reuse or disposal.[14] The term is widely used since about 2009. In 2007 the Sustainable Sanitation Alliance defined five sustainability criteria to compare the sustainability of sanitation systems. In order to be sustainable, a sanitation system has to be economically viable, socially acceptable, technically and institutionally appropriate, and it should also protect the environment and the natural resources.[2]\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: The concept of water stress is relatively simple: According to the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, it applies to situations where there is not enough water for all uses, whether agricultural, industrial or domestic.Defining thresholds for stress in terms of available water per capita is more complex, however, entailing assumptions about water use and its efficiency. Nevertheless, it has been proposed that when annual per capita renewable freshwater availability is less than 1,700 cubic meters, countries begin to experience periodic or regular water stress. Below 1,000 cubic meters, waterscarcity begins to hamper economic development and human health and well-being.\n",
  "thought_process": "As I delve into the original query, \"when did the term sustainability start to be used,\" my initial impressions lean towards the concept of environmentalism and its evolution over time. The user seems to be seeking a specific historical milestone, but the query itself is quite broad. I find myself wondering if the term \"sustainability\" has always been used in the context we understand it today or if it has undergone significant changes in meaning.\n\nAnalyzing the results from the original query, I notice that while they touch on related concepts like environmentalism, conservation, and resource management, they lack a definitive answer to the question of when the term \"sustainability\" first emerged. The snippets from documents at various positions, such as k=1, k=2, and k=10, provide insight into how sustainability is applied in different contexts but do not directly address the historical question posed.\n\nTo expand this query effectively, I decide to employ a structured approach, utilizing the guidelines provided for query enhancement. The technique involves identifying the primary objectives and gaps in the original query, recognizing ineffective terms, and then applying breadth and depth expansion techniques.\n\nStarting with goal elucidation and gaps, it becomes clear that the primary objective is to identify the first documented use of the term \"sustainability\" and trace its historical usage patterns. A significant gap in the current query is its broadness and the lack of specificity regarding historical timelines and the evolution of terminology.\n\nMoving on to ineffective term identification, I list \"sustainability\" itself as a potentially ineffective term due to its broadness and the fact that it does not provide enough specificity for historical or contextual analysis.\n\nFor breadth expansion, I consider terms that introduce new dimensions to the query, such as \"environmentalism,\" \"conservation,\" \"resource management,\" \"eco-conscious,\" \"ecological balance,\" \"social responsibility,\" \"economic development,\" \"long-term planning,\" and \"future generations.\" These terms help in understanding the broader context and related concepts but do not directly answer the question about the term's first use.\n\nTo apply depth expansion, I choose a distant but important topic from the breadth expansion, such as \"precursors to sustainability,\" and delve deeper into related terms. The Brundtland Report of 1987, the World Commission on Environment and Development, and the Rio Earth Summit emerge as significant milestones. Terms like \"Brundtland,\" \"Report,\" \"World Commission,\" \"Agenda 21,\" and \"Rio\" become crucial for understanding the historical context and the formal introduction of \"sustainability\" into global discourse.\n\nAs I balance the structured steps with natural thought patterns, I find myself occasionally reconsidering the direction of the expansion. For instance, while exploring \"precursors to sustainability,\" I also think about related concepts like \"resource management\" and how they might have contributed to the evolution of the term \"sustainability.\" There are moments where I step back to reassess the path I'm on, ensuring that the expansion remains relevant and targeted towards the original query's objectives.\n\nThrough this process, insights emerge from both the structured technique and my intuitive connections. Applying the technique leads to the discovery of specific terms like \"Brundtland Report\" and \"Agenda 21,\" which are directly relevant to the historical emergence of \"sustainability.\" At the same time, my instinct to explore precursors and related concepts helps in understanding the broader context and evolution of the term over time.\n\nSynthesizing the findings with clarity, I conclude that the most effective terms for expanding the query, ensuring a balance between structure and intuition, are those that directly relate to the historical context and milestones in the development and usage of the term \"sustainability.\" The final augmented query, \"precursors environmentalism conservation resource management 1987 Brundtland Report World Commission Agenda 21 Rio,\" represents a thoughtful and systematic expansion that captures both the explicit and implicit aspects of the user's query.",
