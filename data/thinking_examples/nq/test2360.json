  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"where was the diary of a wimpy kid filmed,\" this makes me think of the various locations that could be associated with the filming of the Diary of a Wimpy Kid movies. Though the user might actually be trying to find out more about the production process or the specific settings used in the films, it seems like they're primarily interested in the geographical locations where the movies were shot. \n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the information provided is quite broad and doesn't offer the specificity the user is likely looking for. The terms \"where,\" \"was,\" \"the,\" \"of,\" and \"a\" are too general and don't contribute much to narrowing down the search to specific filming locations. \n\nTo approach this more systematically, I'll use the expansion technique provided, which involves being specific and diverse in the query expansion, applying varied augmentation techniques such as synonym replacement, conceptual expansion, contextual expansion, and using domain-specific terminology. \n\nStarting with the goal elucidation and gaps, it's clear that the primary objective is to identify specific filming locations for each Diary of a Wimpy Kid movie, distinguishing between different movies in the series, finding details about production companies and studios, discovering if sets were built specifically for the movie or if existing locations were used, and determining if any local landmarks or attractions were featured prominently.\n\nThe ineffective terms identified are \"where,\" \"was,\" \"the,\" \"of,\" and \"a,\" which are too broad and don't add much value to the search query. For breadth expansion, terms like \"first movie,\" \"second movie,\" \"third movie,\" \"animated movie,\" \"Vancouver,\" \"Atlanta,\" \"filming schedule,\" \"production design,\" \"on location,\" and \"studio sets\" can be considered. These terms start to introduce more specificity and diversity to the query.\n\nFor depth expansion, focusing on \"Vancouver\" as a key location, we can delve deeper into terms related to the British Columbia film industry, specific filming locations like Riverview Hospital, North Shore Studios, Burnaby Village Museum, and Steveston Fisherman\u2019s Wharf, as well as the Vancouver Film School. This depth expansion provides a rich set of terms that are highly relevant to the filming of the Diary of a Wimpy Kid movies.\n\nApplying the expansion technique systematically, we start to see a pattern where the terms can be grouped into those related to specific locations, production aspects, and the film industry in British Columbia. This systematic approach helps in identifying high-quality search terms that are unique, diverse, and targeted, ensuring the augmented query contains no logical operators, is free of duplication, and omits ineffective words.\n\nThrough this process, insights emerge from both the structured approach and natural intuition. Applying the technique leads to the discovery of specific filming locations and production details, while natural intuition connects these discoveries to the broader context of the film series and its production. The final augmented query, \"Riverview Hospital North Shore Studios Burnaby Village Museum Steveston Fisherman\u2019s Wharf Vancouver Film School British Columbia film industry Atlanta filming schedule sets production design locations,\" captures the essence of the user's query, focusing on specific locations, production aspects, and the film industry, providing a clear and targeted search query for finding detailed information about the filming locations of the Diary of a Wimpy Kid movies.\n\nSynthesizing the information with clarity, it becomes evident that the terms included in the augmented query are the most effective for capturing both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking. These terms balance specificity with diversity, ensuring that the search results will provide a comprehensive overview of the filming locations and production details of the Diary of a Wimpy Kid movies.",
