  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: In \"Remember Me,\" Clarke and a group from the Ark set off to a Grounder camp (Tondc) to complete their agreement for a truce. On the way, Clarke is haunted by visions of Finn. Bellamy tries to convince Clarke to let him go to Mount Weather as an inside man; Clarke says she cannot lose him too. When they arrive at the village, Clarke burns Finn's corpse, along with the corpses of those he killed, in a traditional Grounder funeral. While grieving, Lexa tells Clarke of Costia, her own past love who was tortured and killed by Lexa's enemy, who believed she knew Lexa's secrets. She tells Clarke that love is weakness. At a dinner, Kane gifts Lexa with a bottle of liquor. When Gustus, her right hand, tests it for her, he appears to be poisoned, leading Lexa to believe it was an assassination attempt by the Sky People. Clarke immediately thinks it was Raven, as she was Finn's former girlfriend and loved him. Clarke confronts her; Raven punches Clarke for accusing her of doing it. Lexa nearly kills Raven, but Bellamy figures out it was Gustus who poisoned the cup, and Clarke proves it to Lexa by drinking from the bottle herself. Lexa kills Gustus. When Lincoln confronts Bellamy about how he knew it was Gustus, he says Gustus would do anything to protect Lexa. Clarke decides she sees Lexa's point about how love is a weakness and tells Bellamy he was right and should go to Mount Weather.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: In the second season premiere, the Amanda (Jack Porter's boat) is shown as having sunk, with at least one casualty. Three months earlier, Emily returns to the Hamptons after a long absence and begins to investigate what happened to her mother, Kara Wallace Clarke. At a Memorial Day party, Charlotte tells Emily that Victoria is alive and in hiding before she is taken back to rehab at Conrad's doing. After Emily visits Victoria, she contracts the white-haired man to kill her.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: In \"Hakeldama,\" Clarke, Lexa, and other Grounders discover an army of fallen Grounders, slain by Pike (the new and destructive leader of the Sky People) and his followers. Indra is found wounded and says Bellamy persuaded Pike to let her live in order to tell Lexa that the Sky People reject the newly-formed coalition. Lexa allows Clarke's return to Arkadia to tell Bellamy and the others to step down. Clarke fails to convince Bellamy, but convinces Lexa to end the cycle of violence in hopes of peace.\n",
  "thought_process": "As I begin to tackle the query \"the 100 what did clarke do to be in jail,\" my initial impression is that the user is looking for a very specific piece of information about the TV series \"The 100,\" specifically regarding the character Clarke Griffin and her storyline involving imprisonment. The query itself is quite direct, suggesting the user has some familiarity with the show but perhaps not the intricacies of Clarke's plotline.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the retrieved documents are not very relevant to the user's question. This indicates a need for expanding the search vocabulary to capture more accurately the context and intent behind the query. It's clear that simply searching for \"the 100\" and \"Clarke\" along with terms related to jail or imprisonment might not yield the desired results due to the broad nature of these terms and the complexity of the show's narrative.\n\nTo approach this systematically, I decide to use the query expansion technique via user intent and journey mapping. This involves creating user personas that represent different levels of expertise and engagement with the show, from novice fans to expert analysts. By doing so, I can better understand how different users might search for information about Clarke's jail time storyline, taking into account their prior knowledge, goals, and the contexts in which they're searching.\n\nFor the novice fan, the search vocabulary might be more straightforward, focusing on questions like \"What happens to Clarke in The 100?\" or \"Why is Clarke in jail?\" Intermediate fans might use more specific terms related to the show's plot, such as \"Clarke Griffin storyline\" or \"What does she do to get imprisoned?\" Advanced enthusiasts and expert analysts, on the other hand, would likely employ a more nuanced vocabulary, including terms like \"character development,\" \"episode narrative,\" and \"thematic significance,\" reflecting their deeper understanding of the series.\n\nMapping the information journey of these users, from initial awareness to more in-depth analysis, helps in identifying key terms and concepts that are relevant at different stages of their inquiry. For instance, early on, users might be interested in basic plot details, but as they delve deeper, they might seek more advanced discussions on character motivations, episode specifics, or thematic explorations.\n\nConsidering various usage scenarios further refines the search terms. For example, a fan discussing the show online might use different language than an academic analyzing the narrative structures. Identifying intent-based terms that cut across these scenarios and user types is crucial for developing an effective expanded query.\n\nThrough this process, I extract high-value terms that reflect the diverse needs and language uses of the target audience. Terms like \"Clarke Griffin,\" \"jail time,\" \"storyline,\" \"character motivation,\" and \"thematic analysis\" emerge as central to capturing the user's intent. The final expanded query, \"Clarke Griffin jail time storyline 'The 100' character motivation and episode details thematic analysis,\" aims to encompass both the explicit and implicit aspects of the user's information need, ensuring a more precise and relevant set of search results.\n\nBy balancing structured technique with natural cognitive patterns, this approach to query expansion simulates how an expert would think through the complexities of user intent and information seeking behavior, ultimately leading to a more effective search strategy.",
