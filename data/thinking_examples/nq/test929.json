  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: As of February 22, 2018, Woody Woodpecker has grossed $13.4 million. It debuted at $1.5 million, finishing second at the Brazilian box office behind Blade Runner 2049. The movie increased by +45.4% in its second weekend, moving to first place to $2.1 million.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: In the early 2010s, Universal Pictures and Illumination Entertainment planned a Woody Woodpecker feature film. John Altschuler and Dave Krinsky (King of the Hill) were in talks to develop a story,[6] but in July 2013, Illumination canceled the project.[7] In October 2013, Bill Kopp announced that Universal Pictures had hired him to direct an animated feature film with three interwoven stories.[8] On July 13, 2016, Cartoon Brew reported that Universal 1440 Entertainment was filming a live-action/CG hybrid film based on Woody Woodpecker in Canada. Filming began in June 2016, and ended later in July of that year.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: Blanc also originated the voice and laugh of Woody Woodpecker for the theatrical cartoons produced by Walter Lantz for Universal Pictures, but stopped voicing the character after he was signed to an exclusive contract with Warner Bros. (His laugh was used in the cartoons until 1951, while his \"Guess who!?\" signature line was used until the end of the series in 1972).[8]\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"where did they film Woody Woodpecker movie,\" my initial impression is that this is a straightforward question about filming locations. However, as I delve deeper, it becomes apparent that there are various aspects to consider, such as the historical context of the film, the production studios involved, and the potential for both studio and on-location filming. The user might be looking for specific locations where scenes were shot, or they might be interested in understanding the broader context of how and where Woody Woodpecker movies were produced.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, it's clear that there's a mix of information available, ranging from box office performance to production plans and changes over the years. The text snippets provided give us glimpses into the film's history, such as the involvement of Universal Pictures and Illumination Entertainment, the consideration of a feature film, and the eventual production of a live-action/CG hybrid film in Canada. However, these snippets also highlight the complexity of tracing filming locations due to the evolution of projects and the involvement of different studios and technologies over time.\n\nTo approach this query systematically, I'll use the technique of convening a multi-disciplinary expert panel. This involves gathering experts from different fields related to film production, cultural studies, geography, animation history, and media research. Each expert will bring unique insights and methodologies to the table, allowing us to cover more ground and consider aspects that might otherwise be overlooked.\n\nStarting with the film production expert, we can explore the importance of studio backlots, set designs, and production notes in identifying filming locations. The cultural studies specialist can provide insights into how cultural events or themed parks might influence filming choices, reflecting broader cultural trends. The geography analyst can help map historic film locations using digital archives and GIS tools, looking for patterns in studio preferences that align with urban development at the time of filming. The animation historian can delve into how changes in animation techniques over time might have affected production settings, and the media researcher can guide us through media industry databases and archives for reports and press releases that might contain references to filming locations.\n\nAs we apply this technique, it's essential to balance the systematic approach with natural cognitive patterns, allowing for reconsiderations, intuitive leaps, and connections between different areas of expertise. For instance, while examining production notes, we might stumble upon a reference to a specific cultural event that inspired a filming location choice, which in turn leads us to consider how geographical changes in urban areas might have influenced the selection of those locations.\n\nThrough this process, insights begin to emerge from both the structured technique and natural intuition. Applying the expert panel approach leads to the discovery of specific terms and resources that can enhance our search, such as exploring Universal Studios and Columbia Pictures archives, utilizing GIS tools for historic film locations, and considering the transitions in animation techniques as a factor in filming location choices.\n\nSynthesizing these insights, it becomes clear that the effective expansion of the query must capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking. This involves not just listing potential filming locations but also understanding the historical, cultural, and technical contexts that influenced production decisions. The augmented query, therefore, should reflect a comprehensive approach, incorporating terms related to studio archives, geographical analysis, cultural influences, and transitions in animation techniques.\n\nIn conclusion, by combining a systematic technique with natural thought processes and expert insights, we can develop a nuanced understanding of the query and construct an expanded query that is more likely to yield relevant results. This approach demonstrates how structured techniques and intuition complement each other in the query expansion process, leading to a more effective and informed search strategy.",
