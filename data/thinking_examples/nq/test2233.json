  "reasoning": "The original query seeks to identify the winner of the 2016 Champions League final. The primary goal is to retrieve specific historical sports data, particularly focusing on a European football event's outcome. Analyzing the results' strengths and weaknesses helps highlight that while some documents directly answer this question, others discuss related but less relevant topics such as later qualifications or other finals. To enhance query effectiveness, ineffective terms need identification for removal, and additional terms should be introduced to expand breadth and depth.",

  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: Real Madrid qualified for their fourth Club World Cup by winning the 2016\u201317 UEFA Champions League. The club previously won the 2014 and 2016 editions of the Club World Cup, second only to FC Barcelona in number of wins.[6] Madrid entered the competition in the semi-finals, facing UAE Pro-League champions Al-Jazira, who had won against Oceania champion Auckland City FC of New Zealand and Asian champions Urawa Red Diamonds of Japan.[7] Real Madrid won the match 2\u20131, after controversial decisions by the referee and video assistant referee system.[8]\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: Apart from being used by Milan and Inter, the Italian national team also plays occasional games there.[11] It has also been used for the European Cup finals of 1965 (won by Inter) and 1970 (won by Feyenoord), and the UEFA Champions League finals of 2001 (won by FC Bayern Munich) and 2016 (won by Real Madrid).[3][12]\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: Both clubs had lost their most recent Champions League final, Bayern in 2010 to Internazionale 2\u20130, Chelsea in 2008 to Manchester United on penalties after a 1\u20131 draw. While that was Chelsea's only Champions League final, Bayern had previously played in eight Champions League/European Cup finals, winning four (1974, 1975, 1976, 2001) and losing four (1982, 1987, 1999 and 2010). The clubs had only met each other once in Europe before, with Chelsea winning 6\u20135 on aggregate in the quarter-finals of the 2004\u201305 UEFA Champions League.[14]\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"who won the champions league final in 2016,\" my initial impression is that this is a straightforward historical sports question. The user is seeking specific information about a past event, which makes me think of the importance of accurate and up-to-date sports databases. However, the query might also be trying to understand the context of the match, the teams involved, or the significance of the win, which adds a layer of complexity.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that some documents directly answer the question, while others discuss related topics such as later qualifications or other finals. This tells me that the query terms might be too broad or not specific enough, leading to noise in the results. For instance, terms like \"finals\" or \"qualification rounds\" seem to be pulling in unrelated information. On the other hand, terms directly related to the 2016 Champions League final, like \"Real Madrid\" and \"Atl\u00e9tico Madrid,\" are more likely to yield relevant results.\n\nTo expand this query effectively, I'll use the technique of conceptual expansion, which involves identifying key concepts related to the original query and expanding upon them. This technique is particularly useful here because it allows me to delve deeper into the specifics of the 2016 Champions League final, such as the teams, the outcome, and the context, without getting bogged down in overly broad terms.\n\nStarting with the original query's intent to identify the winner of the 2016 Champions League final, I apply the conceptual expansion technique by first focusing on the specific event: the 2016 Champions League final. This leads me to consider terms like \"UEFA Champions League 2015-2016 season,\" which narrows down the scope to the exact season and competition in question. The mention of \"Atl\u00e9tico Madrid\" and \"Real Madrid\" as participants is crucial, as it gives me specific teams to focus on. Additionally, the fact that the match concluded with a \"penalty shootout\" provides another key term that can help in finding detailed accounts of the final.\n\nAs I delve deeper, I start to think about the broader context of the competition. Terms like \"semi-finalists of the 2015-2016 UEFA Champions League\" can provide insight into the lead-up to the final, while \"goal scorers in the final\" can offer specifics about the match itself. This systematic approach to expanding the query helps ensure that I'm covering all relevant aspects of the event without duplicating terms or including ineffective ones.\n\nHowever, I also allow my intuition to play a role. For instance, recognizing that Cristiano Ronaldo is a key figure in Real Madrid's success, including him in the expanded query might yield more personalized or detailed accounts of the match. Similarly, considering the historical significance of the win, terms related to \"Real Madrid achievements in Champions League\" could provide a richer understanding of the event's impact.\n\nThrough this process of applying conceptual expansion and allowing for natural, intuitive connections, I'm able to synthesize a comprehensive and targeted query. The resulting augmented query, \"UEFA Champions League 2015-2016, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, Cristiano Ronaldo, penalty shootout, semi-finalists 2015-2016, goal scorers 2016 final,\" captures both the explicit details of the match and the implicit context that a user might be interested in. This approach balances the structured technique of conceptual expansion with the natural cognitive patterns of considering related concepts and intuition, leading to a query that is both specific and diverse.\n\nUltimately, the goal is to create an augmented query that enhances the retrieval of relevant documents without overlapping excessively with the original terms. By combining systematic query expansion techniques with organic thinking and intuition, the resulting query is novel, free from ineffective terms, and targeted towards capturing the essence of the user's query.",
