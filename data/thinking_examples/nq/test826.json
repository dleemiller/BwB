The strengths lie in providing direct answers about the document's specifics, whereas weaknesses stem from an excess focus on related but non-specific content like electoral processes and other compromises, which can dilute the targeted information sought by the user.",

  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: Originally, under Article I, \u00a7 3, Clauses 1 and 2 of the Constitution, each state legislature elected its state's senators for a six-year term.[2] Each state, regardless of size, is entitled to two senators as part of the Connecticut Compromise between the small and large states.[3] This contrasted with the House of Representatives, a body elected by popular vote, and was described as an uncontroversial decision; at the time, James Wilson was the sole advocate of popularly electing the Senate and his proposal was defeated 10\u20131.[4] There were many advantages to the original method of electing senators. Prior to the Constitution, a federal body was one where states effectively formed nothing more than permanent treaties, with citizens retaining their loyalty to their original state. However, under the new Constitution, the central government was granted substantially more power than before; the election of senators by the states reassured Anti-federalists that there would be some protection against the swallowing up of states and their powers by the federal government,[5] providing a check on the power of the federal government.[6]\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: Connecticut is known as the \"Constitution State\". The origin of this nickname is uncertain, but it likely comes from Connecticut's pivotal role in the federal constitutional convention of 1787, during which Roger Sherman and Oliver Ellsworth helped to orchestrate what became known as the Connecticut Compromise, or the Great Compromise. This plan combined the Virginia Plan and the New Jersey Plan to form a bicameral legislature, a form copied by almost every state constitution since the adoption of the federal constitution. Variations of the bicameral legislature had been proposed by Virginia and New Jersey, but Connecticut's plan was the one that was in effect until the early 20th century, when Senators ceased to be selected by their state legislatures and were instead directly elected. Otherwise, it is still the design of Congress.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: Article One, Section Eight, of the Constitution permits the establishment of a \"District (not exceeding ten\u00a0miles\u00a0square) as may, by cession of particular states, and the acceptance of Congress, become the seat of the government of the United States\".[13] However, the Constitution does not specify a location for the capital. In what is now known as the Compromise of 1790, Madison, Alexander Hamilton, and Thomas Jefferson came to an agreement that the federal government would pay each state's remaining Revolutionary War debts in exchange for establishing the new national capital in the southern United States.[14][a]\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"where was the 3/5 compromise originally stated in the constitution,\" this makes me think of the historical context and the significance of the 3/5 Compromise in the U.S. Constitution. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the specific location of this compromise within the document, I sense there's an underlying desire to grasp the reasons behind its inclusion and its impact on the constitutional framework. The terms \"where was,\" \"originally stated,\" and \"in the constitution\" seem too broad and non-specific, which could lead to dilution of targeted information.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the top documents provide valuable insights into the historical background and the compromises made during the constitutional convention, but they don't directly point to the specific location of the 3/5 Compromise. The strengths of these results lie in their ability to provide direct answers about the document's specifics, while the weaknesses stem from an excess focus on related but non-specific content.\n\nTo approach this query expansion systematically, I'll use the technique of concept expansion, which involves identifying key concepts related to the original query and expanding them to include more specific and diverse terms. This technique should help because it allows for a deeper understanding of the user's information need and provides a structured way to introduce new dimensions to the query.\n\nFollowing the concept expansion approach, I start by examining the ineffective terms and identify \"where was,\" \"originally stated,\" and \"in the constitution\" as terms that should be avoided due to their broadness. Then, I move on to breadth expansion, where I list candidate terms with increasingly distant concepts to the original query, such as \"U.S. Constitution sections,\" \"textual analysis of compromises,\" \"Constitutional clauses,\" \"slave representation in Congress,\" and \"historical impact of 3/5 Compromise.\"\n\nNext, I apply depth expansion by choosing one distant but important topic from the breadth expansion, which is \"Three-Fifths Clause,\" and go increasingly deeper in the related terms on that one selection. This leads me to terms like \"Article I, Section 2, Clause 3,\" \"enumeration for taxation and representation purposes,\" and \"federal census methodologies.\" These terms are more specific and targeted, providing a clear direction for the query expansion.\n\nAs I reflect on the insights emerging from both the structured approach and my intuition, I realize that the 3/5 Compromise is closely related to the Three-Fifths Clause, which is stated in Article I, Section 2, Clause 3 of the U.S. Constitution. This connection highlights the importance of understanding the historical context and the compromises made during the constitutional convention. My instinct also tells me that incorporating terms related to \"slave representation in Congress\" and \"historical impact of 3/5 Compromise\" could provide valuable context to the query.\n\nThrough this process of applying concept expansion and exploring related threads, I believe the terms that would be most effective for a BM25 index are those that capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking. The final augmented query, \"Article I, Section 2, Three-Fifths Clause enumeration tax Congress representation,\" appears to meet these criteria, as it includes specific references to the U.S. Constitution, the Three-Fifths Clause, and related concepts, while avoiding ineffective terms and providing a clear direction for the search.",
