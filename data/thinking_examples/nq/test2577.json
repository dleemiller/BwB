  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: When the Assyrians conquered the Kingdom of Israel in 722 BCE, Jerusalem was strengthened by a great influx of refugees from the northern kingdom. The First Temple period ended around 586 BCE, as the Babylonians conquered Judah and Jerusalem, and laid waste to Solomon's Temple.[113]\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: The Kingdom of Israel (or Northern Kingdom, or Samaria) existed as an independent state until 722 BCE when it was conquered by the Assyrian Empire, while the Kingdom of Judah (or Southern Kingdom) existed as an independent state until 586 BCE when it was conquered by the Neo-Babylonian Empire.[citation needed]\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: The inhabitants of Samaria/Samerina, who agreed [and plotted] with a king [hostile to] me, not to do service and not to bring tribute [to Ashshur] and who did battle, I fought against them with the power of the great gods, my lords. I counted as spoil 27,280 people, together with their chariots, and gods, in which they trusted. I formed a unit with 200 of [their] chariots for my royal force. I settled the rest of them in the midst of Assyria. I repopulated Samaria/Samerina more than before. I brought into it people from countries conquered by my hands. I appointed my eunuch as governor over them. And I counted them as Assyrians.\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"who did the Assyrians conquer in 722 BCE,\" this makes me think of the historical context of the Assyrian Empire's expansion and its impact on the ancient Near East. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the specific conquests of the Assyrians during that time, I'm not sure yet what the full scope of their inquiry entails. My initial impressions are that the query is quite specific, focusing on a particular year and empire, which suggests the user is looking for detailed historical information.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the top results mention the Kingdom of Israel, Samaria, and the Assyrian Empire's conquests. These results are strong, indicating that the query is well-formed and that the information sought is directly related to historical events. However, there's a weakness in the query's specificity regarding the broader context or other potential conquests of the Assyrians around the same time. This suggests that while the user has a clear idea of what they're looking for, there might be an opportunity to expand the query to capture more relevant information or to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the Assyrian conquests in 722 BCE.\n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here, and to structure my approach, I will use the Conceptual Territory Mapping technique. This involves creating a detailed map of the knowledge landscape surrounding the query topic. By identifying central coordinates, exploring boundaries, pinpointing landmarks, detailing features, and developing a cartographic legend, I can systematically uncover the most relevant terms and concepts related to the query.\n\nFollowing the Conceptual Territory Mapping approach, I first identify the central coordinates of the query, which clearly focus on the Assyrian conquest of the Kingdom of Israel in 722 BCE. The cardinal directions for exploration would include historical accounts, archaeological findings, and the political and social contexts of the time. Setting the scale, I aim for a balance between detailed descriptions of the conquest and broader discussions of its implications for the ancient Near East.\n\nTransitioning into the boundary exploration phase, I recognize that the immediate territory of this query involves ancient Near Eastern history, with a focus on the Assyrian Empire's expansion. Neighboring domains include the histories of Judah and Egypt, as well as themes of imperialism and cultural assimilation. Overlapping territories connect to biblical historiography and the broader impacts of Assyrian conquests on regional power dynamics.\n\nThe landmarks in this conceptual territory are pivotal, including the fall of Samaria, the deportation of the Ten Tribes, and the military campaigns of Sargon II. Detailing these features involves exploring the political structure of the Kingdom of Israel before its fall, the military tactics employed by the Assyrian forces, and the archaeological evidence supporting historical accounts of the event.\n\nAs I map these details, I'm also considering the broader context and how different elements of the historical narrative interconnect. This process is revealing insights into how the Assyrian conquest of the Kingdom of Israel fits into the larger picture of ancient Near Eastern history and the dynamics of imperial expansion.\n\nApplying the Conceptual Territory Mapping technique systematically, I start to see a comprehensive picture emerge. The technique helps in organizing the knowledge territory around the query, but I'm also allowing for natural thought patterns to influence my approach. There are moments where I reconsider the importance of certain landmarks or explore tangential ideas that might not seem directly relevant at first but could provide valuable context.\n\nOne of the key insights emerging from this process is the realization that the Assyrian conquest of the Kingdom of Israel in 722 BCE was not an isolated event but part of a larger pattern of imperial expansion and regional power shifts. This understanding is crucial for developing an expanded query that can capture not just the specifics of the conquest but also its broader implications and context.\n\nThrough this process of applying Conceptual Territory Mapping and exploring related threads, I believe the terms that would be most effective for expanding the query are those that reflect both the explicit and implicit aspects of the user's inquiry. These include \"Assyrian conquest of Samaria 722 BCE,\" \"Kingdom of Israel fall,\" \"Sargon II military campaign,\" and \"Ten Tribes deportation.\" These terms, derived from the systematic application of the technique and informed by natural cognitive patterns, should provide a comprehensive foundation for understanding the historical event in question.\n\nSynthesizing my thought process, I conclude that the expanded query should indeed focus on these key terms to ensure that the search results provide a detailed and contextualized understanding of the Assyrian conquests in 722 BCE. This approach balances the structured technique of Conceptual Territory Mapping with the natural flow of thoughts and insights that emerge during the inquiry process, leading to a more nuanced and informative search strategy.",
