  "reasoning": "The query \"who do you meet at the gates of heaven\" is seeking information about figures or entities encountered upon entering heaven, a concept predominantly explored in religious contexts. The primary goal is to identify relevant sources that explore these encounters across various perspectives, especially beyond the current Christian-centric approach.\n\nTo achieve an effective query expansion, we analyze existing strengths and weaknesses:\n- **Strengths**: Results encompass scriptural references, allegories, cultural depictions, and literary interpretations from a Christian perspective.\n- **Weaknesses**: The focus is heavily on Christian theology with insufficient inclusion of other religious or cultural viewpoints. Some results diverge by discussing broader theological concepts rather than directly addressing who meets individuals at heaven's gates.\n\n**Query Analysis:**\nThe query targets entities met at the entrance to heaven, hinting at an interest in religious symbolism and afterlife experiences across different cultures and traditions. The intent is informational with a focus on understanding spiritual and religious narratives about heaven\u2019s entry.\n\n**Graph Construction:**\n- **Core Nodes**: Entities commonly referenced in religious texts as being present at the gates of heaven (e.g., St. Peter).\n- **First-order Connections**: Related roles, symbols, or entities in Christian doctrine.\n- **Second-order Connections**: Broader concepts such as \"guardians,\" \"angels,\" and other cultural equivalents in different religions like Islam or Hinduism.\n- **Domain Contexts**: Theological studies, comparative religion, and cultural anthropology.\n\n**Expansion Path Selection:**\n1. **Synonymous Terms**: Exploring terms synonymous with \"gates of heaven\" across religious texts (e.g., Pearly Gates).\n2. **Hierarchical Terms**: Broader religious concepts involving afterlife entry.\n3. **Contextual Terms**: Different cultural depictions or interpretations beyond Christian theology, such as Islamic Jannah or Hindu Moksha.\n4. **Domain-specific Terminology**: Specific theological terms from multiple religions.\n\n**Term Extraction and Filtering:**\nFrom each path, the focus will be on selecting terms that align with diverse religious teachings about afterlife entry points and are likely to appear in relevant documents:\n- Synonymous terms (e.g., Pearly Gates)\n- Figures or entities (e.g., St. Peter, Guardian Angel)\n- Broader concepts (e.g., Guardians of Heaven, Angels at the Threshold)\n- Cultural counterparts (e.g., Islamic Jannah entrance, Hindu Moksha)\n- Religious symbols (e.g., Archangel Michael, Golden Gate)\n\n**Augmented Query Construction:**\nCombine original query with selected terms to broaden search scope and inclusivity. This would enable retrieval of documents that provide varied interpretations of the concept.",

  "thought_process": "As I begin to expand the query \"who do you meet at the gates of heaven,\" my initial impressions are that this is a question rooted in religious and spiritual beliefs, particularly focusing on the concept of an afterlife. The user's intent seems to be informational, seeking to understand who or what entities are encountered upon entering heaven, a notion that is predominantly explored within Christian theology but also touches upon other religious and cultural perspectives.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the strengths lie in the retrieval of scriptural references, allegories, and literary interpretations, mainly from a Christian viewpoint. However, the weaknesses include a lack of diversity in religious perspectives, with insufficient inclusion of non-Christian viewpoints, and some results diverging into broader theological discussions rather than directly addressing the question of who meets individuals at the gates of heaven.\n\nTransitioning to a more structured approach, I decide to apply the technique of conceptual graph traversal for query expansion. This involves constructing a conceptual graph with core nodes representing direct entities from the query, first-order connections for direct properties and relationships, second-order connections for related concepts, and domain contexts for specialized fields of relevance.\n\nStarting with the core concept of \"gates of heaven,\" I identify first-order connections such as \"St. Peter\" and \"Pearly Gates,\" which are directly associated with Christian theology. For second-order connections, I consider broader concepts like \"guardians of the afterlife\" and \"angels,\" which can be found in various religious traditions. The domain context for this query falls within religious studies, comparative theology, and cultural anthropology.\n\nAs I proceed with the expansion path selection, I identify promising directions such as synonymous terms (e.g., \"Pearly Gates\"), hierarchical terms (e.g., \"afterlife guardians\"), compositional terms (e.g., \"heavenly hosts\"), contextual terms (e.g., \"Islamic Jannah\" or \"Hindu Moksha\"), and domain-specific terminology (e.g., \"threshold guardians\" in different cultures).\n\nApplying the technique systematically, I extract high-value terms from each path, considering their relevance, distinctiveness, specificity, and searchability. For synonymous terms, \"Pearly Gates\" and \"Heaven's Gate\" are strong candidates. Hierarchical terms lead me to consider \"afterlife guardians\" and \"spiritual guides.\" Compositional terms introduce \"angels\" and \"saints\" as components of the heavenly host. Contextual terms expand the query to include \"Islamic Jannah entrance\" and \"Hindu Moksha transition,\" providing a more diverse religious perspective. Domain-specific terminology adds terms like \"threshold guardians\" and \"psychopomp,\" which are relevant across various cultures.\n\nThroughout this process, I balance the structured steps of the technique with natural thought patterns, including occasional reconsiderations and intuitive connections. For instance, while exploring hierarchical terms, I realize the importance of including \"archangels\" as potential entities met at the gates of heaven, given their role in many religious traditions as messengers and guardians.\n\nAs insights emerge from both the structured technique and my intuition, I synthesize the information to construct an augmented query. This query combines the original question with the selected expansion terms to create a broader, more inclusive search query: \"who do you meet at the gates of heaven OR Pearly Gates OR St. Peter OR Guardian Angel OR Archangel Michael OR Golden Gate OR Islamic Jannah entrance OR Hindu Moksha transition.\"\n\nThis final augmented query aims to capture not only the explicit but also the implicit aspects of the user's search intent, providing a comprehensive approach to understanding who or what entities are encountered upon entering heaven across various religious and cultural contexts.",
