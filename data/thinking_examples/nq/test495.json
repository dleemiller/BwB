For the first time since 2000, a #8 seed advanced to the Final Four as Butler, the national runner-up from the year before, won the Southeast Region. For only the third time ever, a #11 seed advanced to the Final Four as Virginia Commonwealth, one of the \"First Four\" teams, won the Southwest Region. Those three teams were joined by East Region champion Kentucky, a #4 seed.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: This table lists all the cities that have hosted or will host the Final Four, as well as the venues in which the Final Four was or will be played. For additional information about a particular year's tournament, click on the year to go directly to that year's NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament or go to the main article.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: 2012 marked the second year of a 14-year partnership between CBS Sports and Turner Broadcasting cable networks TBS, TNT and truTV to cover the entire tournament under the NCAA March Madness banner.

  "thought_process": "As I delve into the query \"where is final four being held this year,\" my initial thoughts are centered around the importance of identifying the correct location for the 2025 NCAA Men's Basketball Championship Final Four. Given the structured data provided, which includes the conclusion that the event will be held at the Alamodome in San Antonio, Texas, I consider how this information can be verified and expanded upon. The existence of multiple authoritative sources supporting this conclusion, such as NCAA.com, Wikipedia, and ESPN, lends credibility to the claim.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the top snippets provide historical context and specific details about past Final Four events, including notable upsets and the involvement of various Seeds. However, these snippets don't directly answer the user's question about the 2025 location but offer a broader understanding of the tournament's history and dynamics.\n\nTransitioning to a more structured approach, I decide to apply the Query Expansion via Community Q&A Patterns technique. This involves reframing the original query to explore how it would evolve in a community Q&A platform, examining question variations, hidden motivations, answer archetypes, community interactions, and vocabulary extraction.\n\nStarting with question reframing, I consider how the original query could be rephrased as personal experience questions (\"What's it like attending the Final Four in San Antonio?\"), advice-seeking questions (\"How should I plan my trip to the 2025 Final Four?\"), or opinion-based questions (\"What do people think about San Antonio as a host city?\"). This step helps in understanding the various angles from which users might approach the query, potentially revealing underlying motivations such as planning to attend the event, seeking travel logistics, or comparing historical host cities.\n\nIdentifying hidden motivations, I recognize that users might be seeking not just the location but also detailed venue information, historical context, or even advice on attending the event. This realization aligns with the task outcomes provided, which include augmented queries and question variations that reflect a range of user interests and needs.\n\nIn terms of answer archetypes, I aim for responses that are informative, engaging, and tailored to the user's likely motivations. This could include first-person narratives from attendees, expert opinions on travel and accommodation, or step-by-step advice on how to purchase tickets or find the best viewing spots.\n\nWhen considering community interactions, I anticipate common follow-up questions about travel plans, ticket availability, or the local experience in San Antonio. There might also be discussions comparing San Antonio to previous host cities, debates about the best ways to enjoy the event, or requests for clarifications on the event schedule and venues.\n\nFinally, extracting vocabulary from these community interactions and question variations helps in identifying terms and phrases that reflect how real people discuss the topic. This includes not just formal terms like \"Final Four\" and \"Alamodome\" but also more conversational language related to travel, event attendance, and personal experiences.\n\nThrough this process of applying the Query Expansion via Community Q&A Patterns technique and exploring related threads, I believe that terms such as \"San Antonio,\" \"Alamodome,\" \"2025,\" \"tickets,\" \"travel,\" and \"Final Four\" would be most effective for capturing the user's query. These terms balance the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, from the specific location and date to the broader experience of attending the event.\n\nBy integrating structured technique with natural cognitive patterns, including considerations of user motivations, community dynamics, and conversational language, the expanded query aims to provide a comprehensive and user-centric approach to searching for information about the 2025 NCAA Men's Basketball Championship Final Four.",
