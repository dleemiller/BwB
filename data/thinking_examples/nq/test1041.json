  "reasoning": "The primary objective is to enhance search retrieval by expanding the original query \"what is the genus of a bald eagle\" into a more comprehensive set of terms that can capture related scientific, ecological, legal, and conservation-related contexts. The analysis shows that the current results are effective at addressing taxonomic information but lack breadth in covering related domains like ecology or legal frameworks concerning the species. To remedy this, we aim to construct a conceptual graph that identifies core concepts linked with the bald eagle's genus while exploring various dimensions for query expansion. We will utilize synonymous terms, hierarchical taxonomy terms, contextual environmental and conservation references, and domain-specific terminology (such as those used in legal texts) to ensure robust retrieval across different document types.",

Bald in the English name is derived from the word piebald, and refers to the white head and tail feathers and their contrast with the darker body.[18] The scientific name is derived from Haliaeetus, New Latin for \"sea eagle\" (from the Ancient Greek haliaetos), and leucocephalus, Latinized Ancient Greek for \"white head,\" from \u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2 leukos (\"white\") and \u03ba\u03b5\u03c6\u03b1\u03bb\u03b7 kephale (\"head\").[19][20]\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: The bald eagle has sometimes been considered the largest true raptor (accipitrid) in North America. The only larger species of raptor-like bird is the California condor (Gymnogyps californianus), a New World vulture which today is not generally considered a taxonomic ally of true accipitrids.[7] However, the golden eagle, averaging 4.18\u00a0kg (9.2\u00a0lb) and 63\u00a0cm (25\u00a0in) in wing chord length in its American race (A. c. canadensis), is merely 455\u00a0g (1.003\u00a0lb) lighter in mean body mass and exceeds the bald eagle in mean wing chord length by around 3\u00a0cm (1.2\u00a0in).[5][8] Additionally, the bald eagle's close cousins, the relatively longer-winged but shorter-tailed white-tailed eagle and the overall larger Steller's sea eagle (H. pelagicus), may, rarely, wander to coastal Alaska from Asia.[5]\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: gorillas\u00a0(genus Gorilla)\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query \"what is the genus of a bald eagle,\" this makes me think of taxonomy and biological classification. Though the user might actually be trying to understand more about the bald eagle's place in the natural world, not just its genus. The genus is Haliaeetus, but what about its habitat, behavior, or conservation status? I'm seeing several possibilities here, but let me approach this using the Conceptual Graph Traversal technique, which involves constructing a graph of related concepts and then traversing it to find high-value expansion terms. This should help because it will allow us to systematically explore different dimensions of the query, from taxonomy to ecology and legal protections.\n\nFirst, I'll analyze the query to identify core concepts and entities. The main entity is the \"bald eagle,\" and the core concept is its \"genus.\" The search intent seems informational, aiming to learn about the bald eagle's classification. There's an implicit assumption that understanding the genus will provide insight into the species' characteristics or ecological role.\n\nNext, I'll build a conceptual graph. The core nodes will be \"bald eagle\" and \"genus.\" First-order connections include \"Haliaeetus\" as the genus name, and \"Aquila\" as the family. Second-order connections might involve related bird species, like the \"golden eagle\" or \"sea eagles,\" and domain contexts such as ornithology, conservation biology, or wildlife law.\n\nFor expansion paths, I'll consider synonymous terms like \"bald eagle species\" or \"Haliaeetus leucocephalus classification,\" hierarchical terms such as \"birds of prey\" or \"North American raptors,\" compositional terms like \"eagle habitat\" or \"eagle behavior,\" contextual terms such as \"endangered species list\" or \"wildlife conservation acts,\" and domain-specific terminology from ornithology or legal texts regarding wildlife protection.\n\nLet me extract and filter terms for each path. For synonymous terms, \"Haliaeetus leucocephalus\" and \"bald eagle classification\" are relevant. Hierarchical terms could include \"Aquila family\" or \"raptors.\" Compositional terms like \"habitat ecosystem\" and contextual terms such as \"legal protection status\" under the \"Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act\" are also valuable. Domain-specific terms could include \"avian taxonomy\" or \"conservation biology.\"\n\nAs I apply the Conceptual Graph Traversal technique, I notice that considering the hierarchical structure of biological classification leads me to terms like \"taxonomy\" and \"species classification,\" which are directly related to the query. This reminds me of the importance of understanding the bald eagle's place within its ecosystem, which connects to the concept of \"habitat preservation\" and \"ecosystem health.\" My instinct says we should also consider the legal and conservation aspects, given the species' history and current status.\n\nFollowing the technique pointed me toward \"Haliaeetus\" as a critical term, but my experience with similar queries suggests that incorporating terms related to the species' behavior, such as \"bird of prey\" or \"raptor,\" could enhance retrieval in ecological contexts. I'm also noticing a pattern where the legal protection status of bald eagles, particularly under acts like the \"Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act,\" could provide a unique angle for expansion.\n\nStepping back to reassess, I realize the expanded query needs to balance taxonomic precision with ecological and legal breadth. Terms like \"genus Haliaeetus leucocephalus,\" \"bald eagle classification,\" \"taxonomy,\" \"Aquila family,\" \"habitat ecosystem,\" \"legal protection status,\" and \"Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act\" emerge as key. These capture both the explicit query about genus and the implicit interests in the species' ecological and legal contexts.\n\nThrough this process of applying Conceptual Graph Traversal and exploring related threads, I believe these terms would be most effective for a BM25 index: \"genus Haliaeetus leucocephalus bald eagle classification taxonomy Aquila family habitat ecosystem legal protection status Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act.\" They capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, from the bald eagle's taxonomic classification to its ecological role and legal protections.",
