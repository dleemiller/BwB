Unfortunately, the fact that a character was historically stored in a single byte led to the two terms being used interchangeably in most documentation. This often makes the documentation confusing or misleading when multibyte encodings such as UTF-8 are used, and has led to inefficient and incorrect implementations of string manipulation functions. Modern POSIX documentation attempts to fix this, defining \u201ccharacter\u201d as a sequence of one or more bytes representing a single graphic symbol or control code, and attempts to use \u201cbyte\u201d when referring to char data.[6] However it defines Character Array as an array of elements of type char.[7]\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"when does Kubo and the Two Strings release,\" my initial impression is that the user is seeking the release date of the film *Kubo and the Two Strings*. However, the query is quite generic and doesn't specify whether the user is interested in the theatrical release, DVD release, or perhaps the release in a specific country. This makes me think of all the possible aspects related to a film's release that the user might be interested in.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the answer to the release date is directly provided in multiple search results, with the U.S. release date being August 19, 2016. However, I also see that there are international release dates mentioned, such as August 18, 2016, in Hong Kong, which suggests that the user might be interested in release dates across different regions. Furthermore, the search results mention DVD and Blu-ray release details, as well as box office figures, indicating that the user's query could be broader than just the theatrical release date.\n\nTransitioning to a structured approach, I'll use the expansion technique provided, focusing on discovering new, relevant documents across various domains by applying varied augmentation techniques such as synonym replacement, conceptual expansion, contextual expansion, and domain-specific terminology. This technique should help me identify novel and diverse terms that introduce new dimensions to the query without overlapping the original terms.\n\nFirst, I need to elucidate the goals and gaps in the original query. The primary objective seems to be finding the release date, but there are gaps in specificity regarding the type of release (theatrical, DVD, etc.) and geographical location. Ineffective terms such as \"when,\" \"does,\" and \"release\" should be avoided as they are too generic and may dilute the specificity of the search.\n\nFor breadth expansion, I consider terms that introduce new dimensions related to the film, such as \"stop-motion animation,\" \"LAIKA studio,\" \"Japanese folklore themes,\" and \"Focus Features partnership.\" These terms can help in capturing a broader context around the film's production and release.\n\nDelving deeper into one of these topics for depth expansion, let's consider \"stop-motion animation.\" This leads to related terms such as \"animation process,\" \"stop-motion techniques,\" and potentially, other films or studios known for their work in stop-motion animation. This depth chain can provide detailed insights into the filmmaking process and related projects, offering a richer understanding of *Kubo and the Two Strings* beyond its release date.\n\nApplying the expansion technique systematically, I start with the original query's core concept, *Kubo and the Two Strings*, and then expand outward. The technique reveals insights such as the importance of specifying \"U.S. theatrical release date\" to avoid confusion with international releases or other types of releases like DVD. It also points to the significance of the film's production aspects, such as its use of stop-motion animation and its partnership with Focus Features.\n\nAs I balance the structured steps with natural thought patterns, I have moments of reconsideration. For instance, initially, I thought focusing solely on the release date would suffice, but applying the expansion technique made me realize the value in exploring related concepts like the animation process and studio collaborations. This not only enriches the query but also aligns with the user's potential interests beyond the initial question.\n\nIntuitive connections complement the technique, such as recognizing that a user interested in *Kubo and the Two Strings* might also be interested in other stop-motion animation films or the work of LAIKA studio. Brief tangents, like exploring the challenges of stop-motion animation, occasionally yield unexpected insights into the filmmaking process and the dedication required to produce such films.\n\nStepping back to reassess, I realize that the expanded query needs to capture the essence of the user's potential interests while avoiding generic terms. The final augmented query should reflect a balance between the original query's intent and the new dimensions discovered through the expansion technique.\n\nThrough this process of applying the expansion technique and exploring related threads, I believe the terms that would be most effective for a search query are those that specify the type of release, geographical location, and incorporate aspects of the film's production, such as animation technique and studio partnerships. Thus, the augmented query could look something like \"Kubo and the Two Strings U.S. theatrical release date, international release countries timeline, Focus Features partnership, stop-motion animation process,\" which captures both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking.",
