  "reasoning": "The query seeks to understand how 36 can be expressed as a product of prime numbers. Given that some documents highlight relevant aspects such as the factors 2 and 3, we can reinforce this understanding through metaphorical thinking, allowing us to generate new terms and perspectives. Metaphorical mappings from diverse domains (nature, art, mechanics) will help enrich our exploration by drawing analogies between familiar concepts and prime factorization.\n\nBy using metaphors, we aim to identify a variety of ways to express the decomposition of 36 into its prime factors, \\(2^2 \\times 3^2\\). This approach involves creating metaphors that reflect processes or structures from other domains which parallel prime factorization. By mapping elements of these domains back to mathematical concepts, we can uncover new terminologies and insights.\n\nTo achieve this:\n1. Generate diverse metaphors related to the process of decomposing a number into primes.\n2. Map specific components within each metaphor to parts of the original query (e.g., factors as building blocks).\n3.

And indeed there are twelve positive integers that are coprime with 36 and lower than 36: 1, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 25, 29, 31, and 35.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: A number is divisible by a given divisor if it is divisible by the highest power of each of its prime factors. For example, to determine divisibility by 36, check divisibility by 4 and by 9.[5] Note that checking 3 and 12, or 2 and 18, would not be sufficient. A table of prime factors may be useful.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: Bad Day at Black Rock was filmed in Lone Pine, California and the nearby Alabama Hills, one of hundreds of movies that have been filmed in the area since 1920. The \"town\" of Black Rock was built for the film.

  "thought_process": "As I delve into the query \"what is 36 as a product of prime,\" my initial impression is that the user is seeking a fundamental understanding of how the number 36 can be broken down into its prime factors. This makes me think of the basic building blocks of numbers and how they can be combined to form larger values. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the underlying principles of prime factorization, I'm not sure yet what specific aspects they're interested in.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the documents highlight the importance of prime factors 2 and 3 in the decomposition of 36. This tells me that the query is well-formed, but there might be opportunities to explore related concepts or alternative perspectives that could enhance our understanding. The text snippets from the documents provide valuable insights, such as the explanation of distinct prime factors and the process of determining divisibility by a given divisor. However, I also notice that some snippets seem unrelated to the query at first glance, like the description of a film location.\n\nTo expand this query effectively, I decide to employ the technique of metaphorical thinking. This involves generating diverse metaphors for the query topic and mining them for conceptually related terminology from various domains. By using metaphors, I aim to identify a variety of ways to express the decomposition of 36 into its prime factors, \\(2^2 \\times 3^2\\), and uncover new terminologies and insights.\n\nAs I apply the metaphorical thinking technique, I start by generating metaphors from different domains. For instance, I consider the machine metaphor, where prime factorization is like decomposing a complex machine into its basic components. Another metaphor that comes to mind is the culinary one, where finding the prime factors of 36 is akin to breaking down an intricate recipe into its core ingredients. I also explore the tree metaphor, where prime factorization can be imagined as pruning a tree, revealing smaller, more fundamental branches.\n\nThrough this systematic approach, I begin to extract terminology from each metaphorical domain that illuminates aspects of the original topic. Terms like \"components,\" \"assembly,\" \"breakdown,\" and \"core ingredients\" start to emerge, offering fresh perspectives on prime factorization. I notice that these metaphors not only provide complementary perspectives but also allow me to tap into my intuitive understanding of complex systems and how they can be decomposed into simpler parts.\n\nAs I extend these metaphors and combine them to create hybrid perspectives, I start to uncover additional connections and insights. For example, the idea of pruning a tree to reveal its fundamental branches resonates with the concept of factoring numbers to reveal their prime factors. This realization leads me to consider how other domains, like puzzles or networks, might offer valuable analogies for understanding prime factorization.\n\nThroughout this process, I'm aware of the interplay between the structured technique of metaphorical thinking and my natural thought patterns. I allow myself to wander through false starts and reconsiderations, knowing that these detours can sometimes lead to unexpected insights. As I step back to reassess my progress, I'm struck by how the metaphors have helped me to distill the essence of prime factorization and express it in a more nuanced and multifaceted way.\n\nUltimately, the application of metaphorical thinking, combined with my organic thought processes, yields a richer understanding of the query and its related concepts. I'm able to synthesize the insights gained from this process, recognizing that the final terms and perspectives emerge logically from both the technique and my natural cognitive patterns.",
