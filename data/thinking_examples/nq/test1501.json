  "reasoning": "To accurately answer where \"The Curse of Oak Island\" is filmed, it's crucial to trace the show's production history and geographical focus. We need to understand the initial explorations of Oak Island, the surge in interest due to the TV show, current filming practices, and any future technological or exploration trends that may affect where and how the show is filmed. This evolution will help identify relevant filming locations like specific areas of Oak Island and potentially mainland production facilities. Finally, we need to extract precise and augmented search terms.",

  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: The Curse of Oak Island is an active reality television[1] series that first premiered in Canada on the History network on January 5, 2014. The show features what is known as the Oak Island mystery, showing efforts to search for historical artifacts and treasure.[3][4][5]\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: The Curse of Oak Island follows brothers Marty and Rick Lagina, originally from Kingsford, Michigan, through their efforts to find the speculated treasure or historical artifacts believed to be on Oak Island. The series discusses the history of the island, recent discoveries, theories, and prior attempts to investigate the site.[6] Areas of interest include the \"Money Pit\", Borehole 10-x, Smith's Cove, \"Nolan's Cross\", the \"Hatch\", the \"Watchtower\" and the \"Swamp\".\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: The majority of filming took place in Bristol, Rhode Island and Woonsocket, Rhode Island.[2] The only spoken reference to the actual location where filming took place is when the newspaper reporter Teddy states he works for the Woonsocket Call (Woonsocket's daily newspaper).\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"where is the tv show the curse of oak island filmed\", my initial impression is that the user is likely seeking information on the geographical location where the show is primarily filmed, which could include both on-location filming on Oak Island itself and any potential studio or production facilities used. The show's premise, centered around treasure hunting and historical mysteries on Oak Island, makes me think of the island as the primary location. However, I also consider that some parts of the show, especially those involving interviews, analysis, or re-enactments, might be filmed in studios or other off-island locations.\n\nAnalyzing the results from the original query, I notice that the initial snippets provide a good background on the show, its history, and the areas of interest on Oak Island such as the \"Money Pit\" and \"Smith's Cove\". These are indeed crucial components of the show, but they don't directly answer the user's question about filming locations. However, the snippet from document k=10 reveals that filming took place in Bristol, Rhode Island, and Woonsocket, Rhode Island, which directly addresses the user's query. This information indicates that while the show's subject matter is centered around Oak Island, Nova Scotia, the actual filming of the show includes locations in Rhode Island.\n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here for expanding the query to capture more relevant information. Let me approach this using the Temporal Evolution Analysis technique, which involves tracing how a topic evolves through time to discover temporally diverse terminology. This should help because it considers the historical, current, and future aspects of the show's production, which could provide a comprehensive view of its filming locations and related concepts.\n\nStarting with the historical foundation, I trace the origins of \"The Curse of Oak Island\" and note terms like \"Oak Island mystery\", \"treasure hunting\", and \"historical artifacts\". This foundational stage also includes early explorations and attempts to uncover the island's secrets. Moving through the developmental milestones, I identify key moments like the show's premiere, the introduction of new technologies for exploration, and changes in the show's format or focus over time. Terms like \"reality television series\", \"documentary production\", and specific locations on the island become relevant here.\n\nIn the current landscape phase, I assess the contemporary state of the show, including its filming practices, use of advanced technologies like LiDAR or drone footage, and the involvement of historical societies. This step reveals terms such as \"modern excavation equipment\", \"team of experts\", and specific fields of expertise like archaeology or engineering. Finally, considering emerging trends, I look at potential future developments in treasure hunting, historical mysteries, and documentary filmmaking techniques. Terms related to virtual reality experiences, global interest in similar shows, or new excavation technologies come into play here.\n\nApplying the Temporal Evolution Analysis technique step by step, I systematically consider how each phase contributes to the overall understanding of the show's filming locations and related concepts. However, I also allow for natural cognitive elements to influence my thought process. For instance, recognizing that the show's popularity could lead to spin-offs or similar productions makes me think of including terms related to those possibilities. Occasionally, I reconsider the weight given to certain terms or phases, adjusting my approach as insights emerge.\n\nThrough this process, I realize that applying the Temporal Evolution Analysis leads to the discovery of a range of terms that capture the full scope of the user's query. The systematic approach helps ensure that no crucial phase of the show's evolution is overlooked, while my intuitive connections complement the technique by suggesting additional relevant concepts and terms.\n\nThe augmented query, \"curse oak island filming location production studios show filmed behind scenes smith cove money pit documentary owns rights\", emerges from this process as a comprehensive representation of the user's information need. This query balances the structured approach of the Temporal Evolution Analysis with the natural flow of cognitive patterns, ensuring that both explicit and implicit aspects of the user's query are addressed.\n\nIn conclusion, by combining the structured Temporal Evolution Analysis technique with organic thinking, I have developed an expanded query that captures the essence of the user's question about the filming locations of \"The Curse of Oak Island\". This approach not only provides a clear method for query expansion but also demonstrates how structured techniques can be effectively complemented by natural cognitive patterns to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of a user's information needs.",
