  "reasoning": "The primary objective of the original query is to identify the product formed when krypton-85 undergoes beta decay, which involves understanding nuclear transformation. However, there are gaps in providing additional context about applications or broader implications beyond merely stating the decay product. The current search results mainly focus on scientific and technical aspects without expanding into related domains like practical uses of rubidium-85 or broader applications in technology. By identifying ineffective terms from the query that lead to non-specific results, we can redirect focus towards specific expansions that would yield richer contextual insights. Breadth expansion will introduce new dimensions such as related elements or processes, while depth expansion delves into significant aspects like practical applications of the decay product.",

  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: It has a half-life of 10.756 years and a maximum decay energy of 687 keV.[1] It decays into stable, non-radioactive rubidium-85. Its most common decay (99.57%) is by beta particle emission with maximum energy of 687 keV and an average energy of 251 keV. The second most common decay (0.43%) is by beta particle emission (maximum energy of 173 keV) followed by gamma ray emission (energy of 514 keV).[2] Other decay modes have very small probabilities and emit less energetic gammas.[1][3] There are 33 other known isotopes of krypton.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: Gamma rays are produced during gamma decay, which normally occurs after other forms of decay occur, such as alpha or beta decay. An excited nucleus can decay by the emission of an \u03b1 or \u03b2 particle. The daughter nucleus that results is usually left in an excited state. It can then decay to a lower energy state by emitting a gamma ray photon, in a process called gamma decay.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: In this case the atomic mass increases, but the element is unchanged. In other cases the product nucleus is unstable and decays, typically emitting protons, electrons (beta particle) or alpha particles. When a nucleus loses a proton the atomic number decreases by 1. For example,\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"krypton-85 decays by emission of a beta particle. the product of this decay is,\" this makes me think of nuclear transformations and the resulting elements. However, the query seems to be missing context about the applications or broader implications of this decay. The user might be trying to understand the product of the decay, but they could also be interested in related technologies or scientific principles. At first glance, the query appears straightforward, but upon closer inspection, there are nuances that could lead to a richer understanding of the topic.\n\nAnalyzing the initial results, I notice that they primarily focus on the scientific and technical aspects of krypton-85 decay, such as its half-life, decay energy, and the resulting stable rubidium-85. These results provide a solid foundation but lack depth in terms of practical applications or related domains. For instance, the text snippets from documents at k=1 and k=2 discuss the decay process and gamma rays, but they do not delve into the uses of rubidium-85 in technology or other fields.\n\nTo expand this query effectively, I will apply the expansion technique, which involves identifying ineffective terms, performing breadth expansion, and then depth expansion. The ineffective terms in this query are \"decays,\" \"emission,\" and \"particle,\" as they are broad and do not provide specific insights into the topic. \n\nFor breadth expansion, I consider terms that introduce new dimensions to the query, such as \"rubidium applications,\" \"radioactive decay usage,\" \"beta emission energy utilization,\" \"nuclear medicine applications,\" and \"isotope tracing techniques.\" These terms are designed to capture a wider range of relevant information without duplicating the original query's focus.\n\nNext, for depth expansion, I select a distant but important topic from the breadth expansion and delve deeper into related terms. Nuclear medicine stands out as a significant area, leading to terms like \"diagnostic imaging,\" \"radiopharmaceuticals,\" \"gamma cameras,\" and \"MRI contrast agents.\" This depth expansion aims to uncover more specific and application-oriented information that can enhance the understanding of krypton-85 decay and its products.\n\nAs I apply the expansion technique, I notice that the systematic steps are complemented by natural thought patterns. For example, considering the energy utilization of beta emission leads me to think about gamma cameras and their role in diagnostic imaging. This connection is not immediately apparent from the original query but emerges through the expansion process.\n\nThe insights gained from both the structured approach and natural cognitive elements are crucial. Applying the technique leads to the discovery of specific terms like \"radiopharmaceutical development\" and \"MRI imaging enhancements,\" which are directly relevant to the applications of rubidium-85. At the same time, intuitive connections, such as the link between beta emission energy and gamma camera technology, provide a more comprehensive view of the topic.\n\nThrough this process of applying the expansion technique and exploring related threads, I believe the terms that would be most effective for enhancing the query are those that capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking. These include terms from the depth expansion, such as \"nuclear medicine diagnostics,\" \"radiopharmaceutical development,\" and \"gamma camera technology,\" alongside other relevant terms that emerged during the expansion process.\n\nThe final augmented query, \"rubidium applications radiochemistry uses nuclear medicine diagnostics radiopharmaceutical development gamma camera technology mri imaging enhancements,\" reflects a balance between the structured expansion technique and natural thought patterns. It is designed to yield richer contextual insights into the product of krypton-85 decay and its broader implications, moving beyond the initial scientific and technical focus to encompass practical applications and related domains.",
