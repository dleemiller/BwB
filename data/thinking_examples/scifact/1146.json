  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: Background  Extensive debate exists in the healthcare community over whether outcomes of medical care at teaching hospitals and other healthcare units are better or worse than those at the respective nonteaching ones. Thus, our goal was to systematically evaluate the evidence pertaining to this question. Methods and Findings  We reviewed all studies that compared teaching versus nonteaching healthcare structures for mortality or any other patient outcome, regardless of health condition. Studies were retrieved from PubMed, contact with experts, and literature cross-referencing. Data were extracted on setting, patients, data sources, author affiliations, definition of compared groups, types of diagnoses considered, adjusting covariates, and estimates of effect for mortality and for each other outcome. Overall, 132 eligible studies were identified, including 93 on mortality and 61 on other eligible outcomes (22 addressed both). Synthesis of the available adjusted estimates on mortality yielded a summary relative risk of 0.96 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.93\u20131.00) for teaching versus nonteaching healthcare structures and 1.04 (95% CI, 0.99\u20131.10) for minor teaching versus nonteaching ones. There was considerable heterogeneity between studies (I2 = 72% for the main analysis). ...\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: Objectives: To study the change in outcome for patients admitted to an intensive care unit following the establishment of a team of resident medical staff and a change from an \"open\" to a \"closed\" organisational format. Design: Database review of prospectively collected data. Setting: Intensive care unit of a postgraduate teaching hospital. Subjects: 1134 admissions to the intensive care unit over a 3-year period, of whom 476 (42%) followed elective surgery. Main outcome measure: Hospital mortality corrected for illness severity by using the APACHE II scoring system. Results: Crude hospital mortality fell from 28% before the changes to 20% afterwards (P=0.01). With correction for case-mix factors, the probability of death after the changes was reduced by almost half (OR 0.51; CI 0.32, 0.82, P=0.005). Conclusion: A \"closed\" format of organisation of the delivery of care may result in improved outcomes for patients admitted to intensive care units.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: The cloning of animals from adult cells has demonstrated that the developmental state of adult cells can be reprogrammed into that of embryonic cells by uncharacterized factors within the oocyte. More recently, transcription factors have been identified that can induce pluripotency in somatic cells without the use of oocytes, generating induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. iPS cells provide a unique platform to dissect the molecular mechanisms that underlie epigenetic reprogramming. Moreover, iPS cells can teach us about principles of normal development and disease, and might ultimately facilitate the treatment of patients by custom-tailored cell therapy.\n",
  "thought_process": "As I delve into the query \"Teaching hospitals do not provide better care than non-teaching hospitals,\" my initial impression is that this statement is quite provocative and challenges a common assumption that teaching hospitals, with their involvement in medical education and research, would naturally provide superior care. This makes me think about the various factors that could influence the quality of care in hospitals, such as the expertise of the staff, the availability of resources, and the hospital's organizational structure.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the studies primarily focus on mortality rates as the key outcome measure. While mortality is a critical indicator of healthcare quality, it might not capture the full spectrum of care quality. I also observe that the studies acknowledge the limitations of observational data and the potential for confounding variables, which suggests that there's a need to look beyond mere mortality rates and to consider alternative study designs that could establish causality more effectively.\n\nTo expand this query in a structured and meaningful way, I decide to apply the technique of breadth and depth expansion, focusing on introducing new dimensions to the query while ensuring the terms are novel, diverse, and relevant. The first step is to identify ineffective terms that are too broad or non-precise, such as \"better\" and \"provide,\" which don't add much specificity to the query.\n\nNext, I engage in breadth expansion by considering terms that are increasingly distant but still relevant to the original query. This includes concepts like \"patient satisfaction,\" \"healthcare access,\" \"specialized services,\" \"randomized controlled trials,\" \"longitudinal studies,\" \"confounding variables,\" \"socioeconomic factors,\" and \"health outcomes.\" These terms help to broaden the scope of the query beyond just mortality rates, encompassing other crucial aspects of healthcare quality.\n\nFor depth expansion, I choose to dive deeper into the topic of \"patient experience,\" which seems particularly important for understanding the quality of care. This involves exploring related terms such as \"patient surveys,\" \"hospital ratings,\" \"communication with physicians,\" \"wait times,\" \"emotional support,\" \"complications after discharge,\" and \"readmission rates.\" These terms offer a more nuanced view of what contributes to the quality of care in hospitals, moving beyond the simplistic comparison of mortality rates.\n\nAs I apply this structured approach, I also allow for natural thought patterns to emerge, such as reconsidering the initial query in light of new insights or making intuitive connections between seemingly disparate concepts. For instance, the idea of \"patient experience\" naturally leads to thinking about how factors like communication with physicians, wait times, and emotional support can significantly impact a patient's perception of care quality.\n\nThe process of combining structured technique with natural cognitive patterns leads to a rich and multifaceted query expansion. I find myself moving fluidly between the systematic application of expansion techniques and the organic exploration of new ideas and connections. This interplay between structure and intuition is key to generating a query that is both comprehensive and nuanced.\n\nThrough this process, I emerge with an augmented query that captures the essence of what we're trying to explore: \"patient experience surveys hospital ratings communication physicians wait times emotional support complications readmissions.\" This query is not just an expansion of the original but a thoughtful reimagining that incorporates a deeper understanding of the factors influencing healthcare quality.\n\nThe final step is synthesizing these insights with clarity, ensuring that the augmented query is novel, diverse, and relevant, containing only high-quality search terms without duplication or ineffective words. The resulting query is designed to yield non-overlapping results from the original query, providing a fresh and targeted approach to investigating the comparison between teaching and non-teaching hospitals.\n\nIn conclusion, the thought process behind expanding the query involves a dynamic interplay between structured technique and natural intuition, leading to a comprehensive and nuanced exploration of healthcare quality. By balancing these elements, we can generate a query that not only captures the complexities of the topic but also opens up new avenues for investigation and insight.",
