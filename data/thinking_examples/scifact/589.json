These agents can increase heart rate and blood pressure, raising concerns about their cardiovascular safety. OBJECTIVE To examine whether current use of medications prescribed primarily to treat ADHD is associated with increased risk of serious cardiovascular events in young and middle-aged adults. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective, population-based cohort study using electronic health care records from 4 study sites (OptumInsight Epidemiology, Tennessee Medicaid, Kaiser Permanente California, and the HMO Research Network), starting in 1986 at 1 site and ending in 2005 at all sites, with additional covariate assessment using 2007 survey data. Participants were adults aged 25 through 64 years with dispensed prescriptions for methylphenidate, amphetamine, or atomoxetine at baseline. Each medication user (n = 150,359) was matched to 2 nonusers on study site, birth year, sex, and calendar year (443,198 total users and nonusers). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Serious cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction (MI), sudden cardiac death (SCD), or stroke, with comparison between current or new users and remote users to account for potential healthy-user bias. RESULTS During 806,182 person-years of follow-up (median, 1.3 years per person), 1357 cases of MI, 296 cases of SCD, and 575 cases of stroke occurred. ...\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n... The use of preventive medications and revascularization procedures was significantly more common in high-income countries than in middle- or low-income countries (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS Although the risk-factor burden was lowest in low-income countries, the rates of major cardiovascular disease and death were substantially higher in low-income countries than in high-income countries. The high burden of risk factors in high-income countries may have been mitigated by better control of risk factors and more frequent use of proven pharmacologic therapies and revascularization. (Funded by the Population Health Research Institute and others.).\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n... Fertility treatment in MS has been associated with an increased relapse risk in the following 3-month period, especially when the procedure did not result in pregnancy and gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonists were used. Altogether, there is substantial evidence to support a regulatory role of sex steroid hormones in MS. In the absence of correlations with single hormone blood levels, we can only speculate about the underlying mechanisms. In conclusion, the increased MS risk in women and the changes in relapse and progression risk in association with reproductive events suggest significant and complex interactions between immune, neuroendocrine and reproductive systems in MS.\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"In young and middle-aged adults, current or remote uses of ADHD medications do not increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events,\" this makes me think of the potential long-term effects of these medications on heart health. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the safety profile of ADHD medications, there seems to be a gap in exploring how these medications interact with other health factors, such as mental health comorbidities or lifestyle factors, which could influence cardiovascular outcomes.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the top documents discuss the use of ADHD medications and their association with cardiovascular events, but they don't delve deeply into the nuances of long-term health effects or how different demographic groups might be affected differently. The terms \"current,\" \"remote,\" and \"serious\" seem too broad or non-precise, as they don't capture the complexity of medication use patterns or cardiovascular risks.\n\nTo expand this query effectively, I'll apply the technique of conceptual expansion, which involves identifying related concepts and exploring their connections to the original query. This should help because it allows us to consider a wider range of factors that could influence the relationship between ADHD medication use and cardiovascular health.\n\nFollowing the conceptual expansion approach, I should first identify the primary objectives of the original query, which are to understand the long-term cardiovascular impacts of ADHD medications and to explore different medication types and their associated risks. Then, I'll examine the gaps in the current query, such as the lack of consideration for mental health comorbidities, lifestyle factors, and demographic trends.\n\nAs I apply the conceptual expansion technique, I notice that the breadth expansion terms, such as \"long-term health effects,\" \"mental health comorbidities,\" \"lifestyle factors,\" \"pharmacogenetics,\" and \"cardiovascular disease subtypes,\" provide a good starting point. However, I need to go deeper into one of these areas to uncover more specific and relevant terms. Let me focus on \"mental health comorbidities\" and explore its connections to cardiovascular health.\n\nThis step of the technique is revealing insights into how conditions like depression, anxiety, and stress might interact with ADHD medication use to influence cardiovascular outcomes. Which actually reminds me of the importance of considering the interplay between mental health and physical health, a concept that is often overlooked in studies focusing solely on medication effects.\n\nI need to consider the next step in the technique, which involves identifying specific terms related to mental health comorbidities that could be relevant to the query. But I'm also noticing this interesting pattern where sleep disorders and arrhythmias seem to be connected to both ADHD and cardiovascular health, suggesting a potential area for deeper exploration.\n\nApplying this aspect of the technique leads me to discover terms like \"heart disease,\" \"hypertension,\" and \"arrhythmias,\" which are closely related to the cardiovascular outcomes of interest. I just had a realization that connects to what we were exploring earlier - the importance of pharmacogenetics in understanding how individuals might respond differently to ADHD medications based on their genetic profiles.\n\nThrough this process of applying conceptual expansion and exploring related threads, I believe the terms that would be most effective for a BM25 index are those that capture the long-term health effects, mental health comorbidities, and their interactions with cardiovascular health. The augmented query should include terms like \"long-term health effects,\" \"mental comorbidities,\" \"depression,\" \"anxiety,\" \"stress,\" \"sleep disorders,\" \"heart disease,\" \"hypertension,\" \"arrhythmias,\" and \"pharmacogenetics.\" These terms emerge logically from both the technique and natural insights, providing a comprehensive and nuanced exploration of the relationship between ADHD medication use and cardiovascular health.",
