  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: MicroRNAs are frequently deregulated in cancer. Here we show that miR-22 is upregulated in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and leukemia and its aberrant expression correlates with poor survival. To explore its role in hematopoietic stem cell function and malignancy, we generated transgenic mice conditionally expressing miR-22 in the hematopoietic compartment. These mice displayed reduced levels of global 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) and increased hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal accompanied by defective differentiation. Conversely, miR-22 inhibition blocked proliferation in both mouse and human leukemic cells. Over time, miR-22 transgenic mice developed MDS and hematological malignancies. We also identify TET2 as a key target of miR-22 in this context. Ectopic expression of TET2 suppressed the miR-22-induced phenotypes. Downregulation of TET2 protein also correlated with poor clinical outcomes and miR-22 overexpression in MDS patients. Our results therefore identify miR-22 as a potent proto-oncogene and suggest that aberrations in the miR-22/TET2 regulatory network are common in hematopoietic malignancies.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: Mesenchymal niche cells may drive tissue failure and malignant transformation in the hematopoietic system, but the underlying molecular mechanisms and relevance to human disease remain poorly defined. Here, we show that perturbation of mesenchymal cells in a mouse model of the pre-leukemic disorder Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS) induces mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and activation of DNA damage responses in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Massive parallel RNA sequencing of highly purified mesenchymal cells in the SDS mouse model and a range of human pre-leukemic syndromes identified p53-S100A8/9-TLR inflammatory signaling as a common driving mechanism of genotoxic stress. Transcriptional activation of this signaling axis in the mesenchymal niche predicted leukemic evolution and progression-free survival in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), the principal leukemia predisposition syndrome. Collectively, our findings identify mesenchymal niche-induced genotoxic stress in heterotypic stem and progenitor cells through inflammatory signaling as a targetable determinant of disease outcome in human pre-leukemia.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: The anaphase promoting complex or cyclosome (APC/C) is a ubiquitin protein ligase that, together with Cdc20 or Cdh1, targets cell-cycle proteins for degradation. APC/C\u2013Cdh1 specifically promotes protein degradation in late mitosis and G1. Mutant embryos lacking Cdh1 die at E9.5\u2013E10.5 due to defects in the endoreduplication of trophoblast cells and placental malfunction. This lethality is prevented when Cdh1 is expressed in the placenta. Cdh1-deficient cells proliferate inefficiently and accumulate numeric and structural chromosomal aberrations, indicating that Cdh1 contributes to the maintenance of genomic stability. Cdh1 heterozygous animals show increased susceptibility to spontaneous tumours, suggesting that Cdh1 functions as a haploinsufficient tumour suppressor. These heterozygous mice also show several defects in behaviour associated with increased proliferation of stem cells in the nervous system. These results indicate that Cdh1 is required for preventing unscheduled proliferation of specific progenitor cells and protecting mammalian cells from genomic instability.\n",
  "thought_process": "As I begin to expand the query on the functional consequences of genomic alterations in Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS), my initial impression is that the query is seeking a deep understanding of how specific genetic changes affect the disease's progression and symptoms. The user might be trying to identify potential therapeutic targets based on these functional effects, which suggests a focus on both the biological mechanisms and the clinical implications.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the existing research provides a good overview of MDS pathogenesis but lacks a direct focus on the relationship between genomics and functional outcomes. The text snippets from the documents at k=1, k=2, and k=10 offer insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying MDS, including the role of microRNAs, the impact of mesenchymal niche cells on hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, and the importance of maintaining genomic stability through the anaphase promoting complex or cyclosome (APC/C).\n\nTo approach this query expansion systematically, I will use the Conceptual Territory Mapping technique. This involves identifying the central coordinates of the query, which in this case are the genomic alterations and their functional consequences in MDS. The cardinal directions for exploration include the biological, clinical, and therapeutic aspects of the disease. Setting the appropriate scale, I decide to focus on the granular level, examining specific genetic changes and their effects on cellular signaling pathways, hematopoiesis, and disease progression.\n\nAs I explore the boundaries of the query's immediate territory, I identify neighboring domains such as epigenetic regulation, cellular signaling pathways, and disease progression. Noting areas where territories overlap or connect, I recognize the importance of considering the interplay between genetic alterations, epigenetic changes, and environmental factors in MDS.\n\nPlotting major landmarks, I identify key concepts such as driver mutations, passenger mutations, oncogenic signaling pathways, and impaired hematopoietic stem cell function. Mapping \"routes\" or methodologies, I consider the use of animal models, genomic profiling, and bioinformatics tools to investigate the functional consequences of genomic alterations in MDS.\n\nFilling in specialized features within each region, I label with precise, domain-specific terminology, noting historical sites such as the discovery of specific genetic mutations associated with MDS and emerging developments in therapeutic targeting of these mutations. Creating a cartographic legend, I select terms that would help a traveler navigate this knowledge landscape, including genotype-phenotype correlation, functional genomics, hematopoietic differentiation, and therapeutic targets.\n\nThrough this process of applying Conceptual Territory Mapping and exploring related threads, I begin to see insights emerging from both the structured approach and my natural thought patterns. I realize that the functional consequences of genomic alterations in MDS are complex and multifaceted, involving the interplay of genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors. I also identify potential therapeutic targets based on these functional effects, including the modulation of microRNAs, the targeting of oncogenic signaling pathways, and the promotion of hematopoietic stem cell function.\n\nSynthesizing my findings with clarity, I believe that the terms extracted from the expanded query, such as \"investigate functional consequences specific genomic alterations mds focusing impact cellular signaling pathways hematopoiesis disease progression identify potential therapeutic targets based effects,\" capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking. These terms reflect a nuanced understanding of the relationship between genomics and functional outcomes in MDS, as well as the clinical implications of these findings.",
