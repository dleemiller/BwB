This study is registered, number ISRCTN21221452. FINDINGS 459 patients were randomly assigned (115 to each of groups A-C, 114 to group D). Factorial comparison of addition of oxaliplatin versus no addition suggested some improvement in PFS, but the finding was not significant (median 5\u00b78 months [IQR 3\u00b73-7\u00b75] vs 4\u00b75 months [2\u00b78-6\u00b74]; hazard ratio 0\u00b784, 95% CI 0\u00b769-1\u00b701, p=0\u00b707). Replacement of fluorouracil with capecitabine did not improve global QoL: 69 of 124 (56%) patients receiving fluorouracil reported improvement in global QoL compared with 69 of 123 (56%) receiving capecitabine. The risk of having any grade 3 or worse toxic effect was not significantly increased with oxaliplatin (83/219 [38%] vs 70/221 [32%]; p=0\u00b717), but was higher with capecitabine than with fluorouracil (88/222 [40%] vs 65/218 [30%]; p=0\u00b703). In multivariable analysis, fewer baseline symptoms (odds ratio 1\u00b732, 95% CI 1\u00b714-1\u00b752), less widespread disease (1\u00b751, 1\u00b705-2\u00b719), and use of oxaliplatin (0\u00b757, 0\u00b739-0\u00b782) were predictive of better OTU. INTERPRETATION FOCUS2 shows that with an appropriate design, including reduced starting doses of chemotherapy, frail and elderly patients can participate in a randomised controlled trial. ...\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n... RESULTS Bmal1 overexpression inhibited colorectal cancer cell proliferation and increased colorectal cancer sensitivity to oxaliplatin in three colorectal cancer cell lines and HCT116 cells model in vivo. Furthermore, the overall survival of patients with colorectal cancer with high Bmal1 levels in their primary tumors was significantly longer than that of patients with low Bmal1 levels (27 vs. 19 months; P = 0.043). The progression-free survival of patients with high Bmal1 expression was also significantly longer than that of patients with low Bmal1 expression (11 vs. 5 months; P = 0.015). Mechanistically, the effect of Bmal1 was associated with its ability to regulate G2-M arrest by activating the ATM pathway. CONCLUSION Bmal1 shows the potential as a novel prognostic biomarker and may represent a new therapeutic target in colorectal cancer.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n... MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Social role disability (Sheehan disability scale), global quality of life rating, and World Health Organization disability assessment schedule (WHODAS-2) scales to measure disabilities in activities of daily living (mobility, self care, household maintenance). RESULTS Of 214 patients enrolled (106 intervention and 108 usual care), disability and quality of life measures were obtained for 97 intervention patients at six months (92%) and 92 at 12 months (87%), and for 96 usual care patients at six months (89%) and 92 at 12 months (85%). Improvements from baseline on the Sheehan disability scale (-0.9, 95% confidence interval -1.5 to -0.2; P = 0.006) and global quality of life rating (0.7, 0.2 to 1.2; P = 0.005) were significantly greater at six and 12 months in patients in the intervention group. There was a trend toward greater improvement in disabilities in activities of daily living (-1.5, -3.3 to 0.4; P = 0.10). CONCLUSIONS Integrated care that covers chronic physical disease and comorbid depression can reduce social role disability and enhance global quality of life.

  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"Metastatic colorectal cancer treated with a single agent fluoropyrimidines resulted in reduced efficacy and lower quality of life when compared with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy in elderly patients,\" this makes me think of the complexities involved in treating metastatic colorectal cancer, especially in elderly patients where comorbidities and frailty can significantly impact treatment outcomes. The user might actually be trying to understand the efficacy and safety profiles of different chemotherapy regimens in this specific population, considering factors such as age-related frailty, comorbidities, and quality of life.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, it's clear that the comparison between fluoropyrimidines and oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy is crucial, but the query could benefit from more specific terms related to the treatment specifics, patient characteristics, and outcomes beyond just efficacy. For instance, expanding beyond \"fluoropyrimidines\" to include specific drugs like \"capecitabine\" could enhance the retrieval of relevant documents. Similarly, refining \"elderly\" with more precise age ranges or considering comorbidities relevant to colorectal cancer treatment could provide more targeted results.\n\nTo approach this systematically, I'll use the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal technique. This involves constructing a conceptual graph with core nodes from the query, identifying first and second-order connections, and considering domain contexts. The core concepts here include \"metastatic colorectal cancer,\" \"fluoropyrimidines,\" \"oxaliplatin,\" and \"elderly patients.\" First-order connections could involve specific drugs within the fluoropyrimidine class, like \"capecitabine,\" and aspects of oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy. Second-order connections might include related concepts such as \"age-related frailty,\" \"comorbidities,\" and outcomes like \"progression-free survival\" and \"quality of life.\"\n\nFollowing the technique, I should first identify promising directions for query expansion. These could include synonymous terms (e.g., \"advanced colorectal cancer\" for \"metastatic colorectal cancer\"), hierarchical terms (e.g., \"adenocarcinoma\" as a subtype of colorectal cancer), compositional terms (e.g., \"5-fluorouracil\" as a component of fluoropyrimidine therapy), contextual terms (e.g., \"palliative care\" for elderly patients), and domain-specific terminology (e.g., \"neoadjuvant chemotherapy\" in the context of surgical treatment for colorectal cancer).\n\nAs I apply this technique, I notice that terms like \"capecitabine\" and \"oxaliplatin\" are directly relevant, but I also need to consider how \"age-related frailty\" and \"comorbidities\" impact treatment choices and outcomes. This reminds me of the importance of geriatric assessments in oncology, which could lead to exploring terms related to comprehensive geriatric assessments and their role in personalized cancer treatment.\n\nThe process of expanding the query using conceptual graph traversal is revealing insights into how different factors interplay in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer in elderly patients. For example, the consideration of \"progression-free survival\" and \"overall survival\" as key outcomes highlights the importance of not just treating the cancer, but also maintaining the patient's quality of life and managing symptoms effectively.\n\nThrough this systematic approach, combined with my intuition and experience in understanding complex medical queries, I believe the terms that would be most effective for expanding the query are those that capture the nuances of treating metastatic colorectal cancer in elderly patients, including specific treatment agents, patient characteristics, and relevant outcomes. The augmented query could include terms such as \"metastatic colorectal cancer,\" \"capecitabine,\" \"oxaliplatin,\" \"elderly patients,\" \"age-related frailty,\" \"comorbidities,\" \"progression-free survival,\" and \"quality of life.\" These terms balance the need for specificity in medical terminology with the broader contextual factors that influence treatment decisions and outcomes.\n\nBy synthesizing the insights from both the structured technique and my natural thought process, I'm confident that the expanded query will enhance the retrieval of relevant documents, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer in elderly patients.",
