While it provides specific details about the compound (rapamycin) and the biological molecule (triacylglycerols), it lacks context regarding the experimental setup, dosage, or timeframe of the effect. To improve retrieval, we need to expand the query with terms related to:\n\n* **Fruit fly models:** Specific strains or genetic backgrounds commonly used in rapamycin studies.\n* **Experimental methods:** Techniques for measuring triacylglycerol levels (e.g., lipid extraction, spectrophotometry).\n* **Metabolic pathways:**  Processes involved in triacylglycerol synthesis and breakdown that might be influenced by rapamycin.",

  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n... Compared with the placebo, 28 day supplementation significantly increased the concentration of serum beta-carotene 528% (p<0.0001), lycopene 80.2% (p<0.0005), and alpha tocopherol 39.5% (p<0.0001). Serum folate increased 174.3% (p<0.0001) and correlated with a decrease in plasma homocysteine of -19.9% (p<0.03). Compared with baseline, measures of oxidative stress decreased with serum lipid peroxides declining -10.5% (p<0.02) and urine 8OHdG decreasing -21.1% (p<0.02). Evaluation of data from smokers only (n=17) after 28 days of active supplementation showed comparable changes. CONCLUSION In the absence of dietary modification, supplementation with the fruit and vegetable juice concentrate capsules proved to be a highly bioavailable source of phytonutrients. Important antioxidants were elevated to desirable levels associated with decreased risk of disease while markers of oxidative stress were reduced, and folate status improved with a concomitant decrease in homocysteine, and these benefits occurred to a similar extent in smokers when compared to non-smokers.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: The target of rapamycin (TOR) pathway is a major nutrient-sensing pathway that, when genetically downregulated, increases life span in evolutionarily diverse organisms including mammals. The central component of this pathway, TOR kinase, is the target of the inhibitory drug rapamycin, a highly specific and well-described drug approved for human use. We show here that feeding rapamycin to adult Drosophila produces the life span extension seen in some TOR mutants. Increase in life span by rapamycin was associated with increased resistance to both starvation and paraquat. Analysis of the underlying mechanisms revealed that rapamycin increased longevity specifically through the TORC1 branch of the TOR pathway, through alterations to both autophagy and translation. Rapamycin could increase life span of weak insulin/Igf signaling (IIS) pathway mutants and of flies with life span maximized by dietary restriction, indicating additional mechanisms.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is an atypical protein kinase that controls growth and metabolism in response to nutrients, growth factors and cellular energy levels, and it is frequently dysregulated in cancer and metabolic disorders. Rapamycin is an allosteric inhibitor of mTOR, and was approved as an immuno-suppressant in 1999. In recent years, interest has focused on its potential as an anticancer drug. However, the performance of rapamycin and its analogues (rapalogues) has been undistinguished despite isolated successes in subsets of cancer, suggesting that the full therapeutic potential of targeting mTOR has yet to be exploited. A new generation of ATP-competitive inhibitors that directly target the mTOR catalytic site display potent and comprehensive mTOR inhibition and are in early clinical trials.\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"Rapamycin decreases the concentration of triacylglycerols in fruit flies,\" this makes me think of the complex interactions between rapamycin, a compound known for its immunosuppressive and antiproliferative properties, and triacylglycerols, a key component of lipid metabolism in organisms. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the broader implications of rapamycin on lipid metabolism in fruit flies, or perhaps how this interaction could inform human health and disease models, the query lacks specificity regarding the experimental context, such as the dosage of rapamycin, the duration of exposure, and the specific strain of fruit flies used.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the top documents discuss the effects of rapamycin on longevity, oxidative stress, and nutrient sensing in Drosophila melanogaster, as well as its role in mammalian systems, particularly regarding the TOR pathway. These results highlight the strengths of the search terms in retrieving documents related to rapamycin's effects on biological systems but also reveal weaknesses in capturing the specific aspect of triacylglycerol metabolism in fruit flies.\n\nTo expand this query effectively, I'll approach it using the Conceptual Graph Traversal technique, which involves constructing a conceptual graph with core nodes (rapamycin, triacylglycerols, fruit flies), first-order connections (effects on lipid metabolism, TOR pathway), second-order connections (experimental methods, genetic backgrounds), and domain contexts (entomology, pharmacology, biochemistry). This should help because it systematically organizes related concepts and identifies gaps in the original query.\n\nFollowing the Conceptual Graph Traversal approach, I first identify core concepts: rapamycin, triacylglycerols, and fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster). The search intent seems informational, aiming to understand the relationship between rapamycin and triacylglycerol levels in fruit flies. Implicit assumptions include the relevance of the TOR pathway and the potential for rapamycin to influence lipid metabolism.\n\nNext, I construct the conceptual graph. Core nodes are rapamycin, triacylglycerols, and Drosophila melanogaster. First-order connections include the TOR pathway, lipid metabolism, and experimental methods for measuring triacylglycerol levels. Second-order connections might involve specific genetic backgrounds of fruit flies, other compounds that influence the TOR pathway, and diseases or conditions related to dysregulated lipid metabolism.\n\nFor expansion path selection, I consider synonymous terms (e.g., \"sirolimus\" for rapamycin), hierarchical terms (e.g., \"lipid metabolism\" is a broader concept than \"triacylglycerol synthesis\"), compositional terms (e.g., \"TORC1\" as a component of the TOR pathway), contextual terms (e.g., \"dietary restriction\" as a context where rapamycin's effects might be relevant), and domain-specific terminology (e.g., \"autophagy\" as a process influenced by the TOR pathway).\n\nApplying these expansion paths, I extract high-value terms such as \"Drosophila melanogaster,\" \"lipid metabolism,\" \"TOR pathway,\" \"autophagy,\" and \"dietary restriction.\" Filtering these terms for relevance, distinctiveness, specificity, and searchability, I prioritize terms closely related to the original query's intent and likely to appear in relevant documents.\n\nThrough this process of applying Conceptual Graph Traversal and exploring related threads, I believe the most effective expansion terms for improving document retrieval about the effects of rapamycin on triacylglycerol levels in fruit flies would include \"Drosophila melanogaster,\" \"TOR pathway,\" \"lipid metabolism,\" and \"autophagy.\" These terms capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, enhancing the query to better reflect the complexities of rapamycin's influence on lipid metabolism in fruit flies.\n\nThe final augmented query, \"rapamycin triacylglycerols Drosophila melanogaster lipid metabolism TOR pathway,\" synthesizes the original query with the identified expansion terms, providing a more comprehensive and specific search query that should yield more relevant results regarding the effects of rapamycin on triacylglycerol levels in fruit flies, including experimental methods, genetic factors, and the underlying molecular mechanisms.",
