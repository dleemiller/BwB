METHODS In the context of the GReek AntiPlatelet REgistry (GRAPE) we assessed the prevalence, predictive factors and short-term outcome of in-hospital P2Y12 inhibitor switching in 1794 ACS patients undergoing PCI. RESULTS Switching occurred in 636 (35.5%) patients of which in the form of clopidogrel to a novel agent, novel agent to clopidogrel and between prasugrel and ticagrelor in 574 (90.4%), 34 (5.3%) and 27 (4.3%) patients, respectively. Presentation to non PCI-capable hospital, bivalirudin use, age \u226575 years (inverse predictor), and regional trends emerged as predictive factors of switching to a novel agent. At combined in-hospital and one-month follow-up, propensity matched pairs analysis showed no differences in major adverse cardiovascular (MACE) or bleeding events between switching from clopidogrel to a novel agent vs novel agent constant administration. More Bleeding Academic Research Consortium type 1, type 2 and any type events and fewer MACE were seen when switching from clopidogrel to a novel agent vs only clopidogrel administration (23.7%, 3.8%, 30.6%, 1.2% vs 8.9%, 1.2%, 12.0%, 3.8% with P < .001, P = .03, P < .001 and P = .03 respectively). ...\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: BACKGROUND Although unstable coronary artery disease is the most common reason for admission to a coronary care unit, the long-term prognosis of patients with this diagnosis is unknown. This is particularly true for patients with diabetes mellitus, who are known to have a high morbidity and mortality after an acute myocardial infarction. METHODS AND RESULTS Prospectively collected data from 6 different countries in the Organization to Assess Strategies for Ischemic Syndromes (OASIS) registry were analyzed to determine the 2-year prognosis of diabetic and nondiabetic patients who were hospitalized with unstable angina or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction. Overall, 1718 of 8013 registry patients (21%) had diabetes. Diabetic patients had a higher rate of coronary bypass surgery than nondiabetic patients (23% versus 20%, P:<0.001) but had similar rates of catheterization and angioplasty. Diabetes independently predicted mortality (relative risk [RR], 1.57; 95% CI, 1.38 to 1.81; P:<0.001), as well as cardiovascular death, new myocardial infarction, stroke, and new congestive heart failure. Moreover, compared with their nondiabetic counterparts, women had a significantly higher risk than men (RR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.60 to 2.44; and RR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.56, respectively). ...\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n... RESULTS During follow-up, 1.2 percent of the 173 patients with maximal blood troponin T levels of less than 0.06 microg per liter died of cardiac causes, as compared with 8.7 percent of the 367 patients with levels of 0.06 to 0.59 microg per liter and 15.4 percent of the 377 patients with levels of at least 0.60 microg per liter (P=0.007 and P=0.001, respectively). The rates of death from cardiac causes were 5.7 percent among the 314 patients with blood C-reactive protein levels of less than 2 mg per liter, 7.8 percent among the 294 with levels of 2 to 10 mg per liter, and 16.5 percent among the 309 with levels of more than 10 mg per liter (P=0.29 and P=0.001, respectively). The rates of death from cardiac causes were 5.4 percent among the 314 patients with blood fibrinogen levels of less than 3.4 g per liter, 12.0 percent among the 300 with levels of 3.4 to 3.9 g per liter, and 12.9 percent among the 303 with levels of at least 4.0 g per liter (P=0.004 and P=0.69, respectively). In a multivariate analysis, levels of troponin T and C-reactive protein were independent predictors of the risk of death from cardiac causes. CONCLUSIONS In unstable coronary artery disease, elevated levels of troponin T and C-reactive protein are strongly related to the long-term risk of death from cardiac causes. These markers are independent risk factors, and their effects are additive with respect to each other and other clinical indicators of risk.\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the query about diabetic patients with acute coronary syndrome and their increased risk for bleeding events, my initial impression is that this is a complex medical issue requiring a deep understanding of both diabetes management and cardiology. The user is likely seeking information on how to mitigate this risk, which involves understanding the physiological mechanisms by which diabetes increases bleeding risk, comparing the safety and efficacy of different treatment approaches, and developing evidence-based guidelines for managing this risk.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the top documents discuss the use of P2Y12 inhibitors in patients with acute coronary syndrome, the long-term prognosis of diabetic patients with unstable coronary artery disease, and the role of biomarkers like troponin T and C-reactive protein in predicting cardiac risk. These results provide valuable insights into the current state of research and clinical practice in this area but also highlight the need for a more comprehensive approach to understanding the complex interplay between diabetes, acute coronary syndrome, and bleeding risk.\n\nTo expand this query effectively, I will apply the journalistic investigation technique. This involves assessing the query to identify what the user is truly seeking, considering real-world contexts where this query is relevant, investigating authoritative sources of information, creating diverse headlines to address the query from multiple angles, and extracting specific terms that represent precise concepts related to the query.\n\nStarting with query assessment, it's clear that the user needs practical advice on managing bleeding risk in diabetic patients with acute coronary syndrome, as well as factual information on the physiological mechanisms involved and conceptual understanding of the latest research and clinical guidelines. There are assumptions about the effectiveness of current treatment approaches and knowledge gaps regarding the optimal balance between preventing thrombosis and managing bleeding risk.\n\nConsidering real-world contexts, this query is relevant in professional settings such as cardiology and endocrinology, in educational settings for medical students and residents, and in personal situations for patients and their families. Identifying diverse real-world scenarios helps to ensure that the query expansion covers a broad range of needs and perspectives.\n\nInvestigating resource information, notable experts in cardiology and diabetes research, established methodologies like the use of P2Y12 inhibitors, and essential terminology such as \"bleeding risk,\" \"anticoagulation,\" and \"antiplatelet therapy\" are crucial. Organizations like the American Heart Association and the American Diabetes Association are also key resources.\n\nCreating headlines to introduce articles addressing the query from multiple angles helps to uncover a wide range of relevant terms and concepts. For example, \"Diabetes and Heart Disease: Understanding the Link Between Acute Coronary Syndrome and Bleeding Risk\" or \"Managing Bleeding Risk in Diabetic Patients: A Comparison of Anticoagulation Therapies.\" These headlines suggest terms like \"cardiovascular complications,\" \"vascular integrity,\" and \"platelet function,\" which are essential for a comprehensive query expansion.\n\nExtracting terms from these headlines and from the initial results, such as \"diabetes mellitus,\" \"acute coronary syndrome,\" \"P2Y12 inhibitors,\" \"troponin T,\" and \"C-reactive protein,\" provides a solid foundation for the expanded query. These terms represent precise concepts related to the query and include terminology that experts in the field would use.\n\nThrough this process of applying the journalistic investigation technique and exploring related threads, I believe the expanded query should include terms that capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking. This includes not just the medical terms and concepts but also the practical implications for patient management and the latest research findings.\n\nBy synthesizing the insights from both the structured technique and natural thought patterns, the final expanded query emerges logically from both the technique and natural insights, ensuring that it is comprehensive, relevant, and effective for retrieving high-quality information on this complex medical topic.",
