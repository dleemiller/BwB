  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: Cystic fibrosis is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (encoded by Cftr) that impair its role as an apical chloride channel that supports bicarbonate transport. Individuals with cystic fibrosis show retained, thickened mucus that plugs airways and obstructs luminal organs as well as numerous other abnormalities that include inflammation of affected organs, alterations in lipid metabolism and insulin resistance. Here we show that colonic epithelial cells and whole lung tissue from Cftr-deficient mice show a defect in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma, encoded by Pparg) function that contributes to a pathological program of gene expression. Lipidomic analysis of colonic epithelial cells suggests that this defect results in part from reduced amounts of the endogenous PPAR-gamma ligand 15-keto-prostaglandin E(2) (15-keto-PGE(2)). Treatment of Cftr-deficient mice with the synthetic PPAR-gamma ligand rosiglitazone partially normalizes the altered gene expression pattern associated with Cftr deficiency and reduces disease severity. Rosiglitazone has no effect on chloride secretion in the colon, but it increases expression of the genes encoding carbonic anhydrases 4 and 2 (Car4 and Car2), increases bicarbonate secretion and reduces mucus retention. These studies reveal a reversible defect in PPAR-gamma signaling in Cftr-deficient cells that can be pharmacologically corrected to ameliorate the severity of the cystic fibrosis phenotype in mice.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n... On the other hand, serum FGF21 has been implicated as a potential biomarker for the early detection of these cardiometabolic disorders. This review summarizes recent developments in the understanding of FGF21, from physiological and clinical perspectives.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n... Like Duffy antigen for chemokine receptor (DARC), D6 and CCX-CKR, CCRL2 does not signal, but it constitutively recycles, potentially reducing local concentration of CCL5 and CCL19 and subsequent immune responses. Surprisingly, chemerin, a ligand for CMKLR1, is a ligand for CCRL2. CCRL2 binds chemerin and increases local chemerin concentration to efficiently present it to CMKLR1 on nearby cells, providing a link between CCRL2 and CMKLR1. Although these findings suggest an anti-inflammatory role, a recent study using CCRL2-deficient mice indicates a proinflammatory role; thus, CCRL2 may also be multifunctional. Further studies using CMKLR1- or CCRL2-deficient mice are needed to further define the role of these receptors in immune responses and other cellular processes.\n",
  "thought_process": "As I begin to expand the query \"PPAR-RXRs are inhibited by PPAR ligands,\" my initial impressions are that this is a highly specialized topic within the realm of molecular biology and pharmacology. The user seems to be looking for detailed information on how PPAR ligands affect the interaction between PPARs and RXRs, which are crucial components in the regulation of gene expression. My first association is with the concept of nuclear receptors and their role in transcriptional regulation. However, I realize that to fully address this query, I need to delve deeper into the mechanisms of inhibition, the specific effects of different PPAR ligands, and potentially how these interactions are modulated by hormonal signals or influenced by toxicological factors.\n\nAnalyzing the initial results provided, I notice that while they touch upon aspects of PPAR function and related diseases, such as cystic fibrosis, they do not directly address the inhibitory effects of PPAR ligands on PPAR-RXR heterodimerization. This suggests a gap in the current information that needs to be filled through a more targeted and expanded search query.\n\nTo transition into a structured approach, I decide to apply the \"Query Expansion via Multi-Disciplinary Expert Panel\" technique. This involves imagining a panel of experts from diverse fields such as pharmacology, molecular biology, endocrinology, biochemistry, and toxicology. Each expert would bring their unique perspective and knowledge to the analysis of the query.\n\nStarting with the pharmacologist, I consider how different PPAR ligands might interact with PPARs and RXRs, potentially inhibiting their heterodimerization and affecting transcriptional activity. The molecular biologist would likely focus on the specific amino acid residues involved in the receptor interaction and how ligand binding could induce conformational changes that disrupt heterodimerization. The endocrinologist might explore how hormonal pathways, such as those involving thyroid hormone receptors, could influence PPAR-RXR activity. Meanwhile, the biochemist could shed light on the enzyme-mediated metabolism of PPAR ligands and how their breakdown products might exhibit different biological activities. Lastly, the toxicologist would be crucial in assessing the potential unintended effects of PPAR ligands on other receptors or signaling pathways.\n\nAs I systematically apply this technique, I find myself occasionally reconsidering the initial query in light of new insights. For instance, recognizing the importance of conformational changes in receptor interaction leads me to wonder if there are specific ligands known to induce such changes without directly blocking the RXR binding site. This line of thinking also intuitively connects to the concept of structure-activity relationships, highlighting the need to explore databases that catalog how different chemical structures of ligands influence their biological activity.\n\nThe application of the technique also leads to several false starts or tangents. At one point, I find myself deeply exploring the role of PPARs in lipid metabolism, only to realize that while relevant, this does not directly address the query's focus on PPAR-RXR heterodimerization. However, this detour does yield an unexpected insight into how alterations in lipid metabolism could indirectly influence PPAR activity and thus impact the query's central question.\n\nThroughout this process, I am balancing the structured steps of the technique with natural thought patterns and intuitive connections. The technique provides a systematic framework for analyzing the query, but it is the interjection of organic thinking that allows for creative leaps and the synthesis of insights from different disciplines.\n\nUltimately, the synthesis of these insights leads to the formulation of an expanded query that captures the complexity and multidisciplinary nature of the original question. The expanded query, \"Influence of PPAR ligands on PPAR-RXR heterodimerization and transcriptional activity; exploring mechanisms of inhibition, hormonal modulation, and toxicological implications,\" reflects a deeper understanding of the biological processes involved and the necessity of considering multiple factors when investigating the effects of PPAR ligands.\n\nThis thought process demonstrates how the application of a structured technique, combined with natural cognitive elements and interdisciplinary insights, can lead to a more comprehensive and effective approach to query expansion. By embracing both the systematic and intuitive aspects of thinking, we can develop search queries that more accurately reflect the complexity of the questions being asked and are thus more likely to yield relevant and useful results.",
