  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: Allergic asthma is a T helper type 2 (T(H)2)-dominated disease of the lung. In people with asthma, a fraction of CD4(+) T cells express the CX3CL1 receptor, CX3CR1, and CX3CL1 expression is increased in airway smooth muscle, lung endothelium and epithelium upon allergen challenge. Here we found that untreated CX3CR1-deficient mice or wild-type (WT) mice treated with CX3CR1-blocking reagents show reduced lung disease upon allergen sensitization and challenge. Transfer of WT CD4(+) T cells into CX3CR1-deficient mice restored the cardinal features of asthma, and CX3CR1-blocking reagents prevented airway inflammation in CX3CR1-deficient recipients injected with WT T(H)2 cells. We found that CX3CR1 signaling promoted T(H)2 survival in the inflamed lungs, and injection of B cell leukemia/lymphoma-2 protein (BCl-2)-transduced CX3CR1-deficient T(H)2 cells into CX3CR1-deficient mice restored asthma. CX3CR1-induced survival was also observed for T(H)1 cells upon airway inflammation but not under homeostatic conditions or upon peripheral inflammation. Therefore, CX3CR1 and CX3CL1 may represent attractive therapeutic targets in asthma.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: The molecular basis for the distinctive cytokine expression of CD4+ T helper 1 (Th1) and T helper 2 (Th2) subsets remains elusive. Here, we report that the proto-oncogene c-maf, a basic region/leucine zipper transcription factor, controls tissue-specific expression of IL-4. c-Maf is expressed in Th2 but not Th1 clones and is induced during normal precursor cell differentiation along a Th2 but not Th1 lineage. c-Maf binds to a c-Maf response element (MARE) in the proximal IL-4 promoter adjacent to a site footprinted by extracts from Th2 but not Th1 clones. Ectopic expression of c-Maf transactivates the IL-4 promoter in Th1 cells, B cells, and nonlymphoid cells, a function that maps to the MARE and Th2-specific footprint. Furthermore, c-Maf acts in synergy with the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-ATp) to initiate endogeneous IL-4 production by B cells. Manipulation of c-Maf may alter Th subset ratios in human disease.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: Type 2 immune responses are defined by the cytokines interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-5, IL-9 and IL-13, which can either be host protective or have pathogenic activity. Type 2 immunity promotes antihelminth immunity, suppresses type 1-driven autoimmune disease, neutralizes toxins, maintains metabolic homeostasis, and regulates wound repair and tissue regeneration pathways following infection or injury. Nevertheless, when type 2 responses are dysregulated, they can become important drivers of disease. Type 2 immunity induces a complex inflammatory response characterized by eosinophils, mast cells, basophils, type 2 innate lymphoid cells, IL-4-and/or IL-13-conditioned macrophages and T helper 2 (TH2) cells, which are crucial to the pathogenesis of many allergic and fibrotic disorders. As chronic type 2 immune responses promote disease, the mechanisms that regulate their maintenance are thought to function as crucial disease modifiers. This Review discusses the many endogenous negative regulatory mechanisms that antagonize type 2 immunity and highlights how therapies that target some of these pathways are being developed to treat type 2-mediated disease.\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"CX3CR1 on the Th2 cells promotes T cell survival,\" this makes me think of the intricate relationships between chemokine receptors, T helper cells, and the immune response, particularly in the context of allergic asthma. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the specific mechanisms by which CX3CR1 influences Th2 cell survival, the initial query seems to lack the specificity needed to target the most relevant information directly. \n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the existing literature points towards CX3CR1's role in asthma, its interaction with T helper cells, and the broader context of allergic inflammation. However, there's a clear need to delve deeper into the specific pathways and mechanisms involved, such as cytokine signaling, chemokine receptors, and cell survival pathways. The initial results provide a foundation but lack the depth required to fully grasp CX3CR1's impact on Th2 cell survival.\n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here, but to systematically expand this query, I'll approach it using a technique that involves both breadth and depth expansion. This should help because it allows us to introduce new dimensions to the query while avoiding generic or overly broad terms. For instance, starting with the concept of T helper cells and expanding into areas like allergic inflammation, cytokine signaling, and immune regulation can offer a more nuanced understanding.\n\nLet's begin with the ineffective terms: CX3CR1, \"on,\" and \"cells.\" These are either too specific or too broad and don't add much value to the query when used alone. Moving to breadth expansion, terms like \"T helper cells,\" \"allergic inflammation,\" \"cytokine signaling,\" \"chemokine receptors,\" \"immune regulation,\" \"apoptosis,\" and \"cell survival pathways\" offer a wider scope but still relate directly to the original query's intent.\n\nNow, focusing on depth expansion, if we choose \"cytokine signaling\" as our key area to delve deeper into, we can explore related terms like the \"IL-4 pathway,\" \"STAT6 activation,\" \"transcriptional regulation,\" \"Bcl-2 family,\" and \"anti-apoptotic proteins.\" This step of the technique is revealing insights into how CX3CR1 might influence Th2 cell survival through these specific pathways, which is a crucial aspect of understanding its role in allergic asthma.\n\nFollowing this approach, I notice that applying the depth expansion technique leads me to terms like \"IL-4 pathway\" and \"Bcl-2 family,\" which are directly related to the survival and function of Th2 cells. This realization connects to what we were exploring earlier regarding the need to understand the specific mechanisms of CX3CR1's action on Th2 cells. It seems that the IL-4 pathway, with its involvement in Th2 cell differentiation and function, and the Bcl-2 family, with its role in apoptosis regulation, could be pivotal in elucidating how CX3CR1 promotes T cell survival.\n\nI just had a realization that connects to what we were exploring earlier: the importance of considering not just the direct effects of CX3CR1 on Th2 cells but also the broader immune context, including other cell types and signaling pathways. This includes looking into how type 2 immune responses, characterized by the presence of IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, and IL-13, contribute to the pathogenesis of allergic diseases and how CX3CR1 fits into this landscape.\n\nThrough this process of applying the expansion technique and exploring related threads, I believe the terms that would be most effective for a targeted search query are those that capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking. This includes terms from our depth expansion, such as \"IL-4 pathway,\" \"STAT6 activation,\" \"Bcl-2 family,\" and \"anti-apoptotic proteins,\" which provide a detailed insight into the mechanisms involved. \n\nThus, the expanded query, \"T helper cells, allergic inflammation, IL-4 pathway, STAT6 activation, Bcl-2 family, anti-apoptotic proteins,\" offers a comprehensive approach to understanding CX3CR1's role in promoting Th2 cell survival, especially in the context of allergic asthma. It balances specificity with diversity, ensuring that the search results will provide a rich and nuanced understanding of the topic at hand.",
