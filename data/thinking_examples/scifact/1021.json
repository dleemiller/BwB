  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: Although susceptibility of neurons in the brain to microbial infection is a major determinant of clinical outcome, little is known about the molecular factors governing this vulnerability. Here we show that two types of neurons from distinct brain regions showed differential permissivity to replication of several positive-stranded RNA viruses. Granule cell neurons of the cerebellum and cortical neurons from the cerebral cortex have unique innate immune programs that confer differential susceptibility to viral infection ex vivo and in vivo. By transducing cortical neurons with genes that were expressed more highly in granule cell neurons, we identified three interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs; Ifi27, Irg1 and Rsad2 (also known as Viperin)) that mediated the antiviral effects against different neurotropic viruses. Moreover, we found that the epigenetic state and microRNA (miRNA)-mediated regulation of ISGs correlates with enhanced antiviral response in granule cell neurons. Thus, neurons from evolutionarily distinct brain regions have unique innate immune signatures, which probably contribute to their relative permissiveness to infection.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: West Nile virus (WNV) is the most common arthropod-borne flavivirus in the United States; however, the vector ligand(s) that participate in infection are not known. We now show that an Aedes aegypti C-type lectin, mosGCTL-1, is induced by WNV, interacts with WNV in a calcium-dependent manner, and facilitates infection in vivo and in vitro. A mosquito homolog of human CD45 in A. aegypti, designated mosPTP-1, recruits mosGCTL-1 to enable viral attachment to cells and to enhance viral entry. In vivo experiments show that mosGCTL-1 and mosPTP-1 function as part of the same pathway and are critical for WNV infection of mosquitoes. A similar phenomenon was also observed in Culex quinquefasciatus, a natural vector of WNV, further demonstrating that these genes participate in WNV infection. During the mosquito blood-feeding process, WNV infection was blocked in vivo with mosGCTL-1 antibodies. A molecular understanding of flaviviral-arthropod interactions may lead to strategies to control viral dissemination in nature.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n... The chemokines CXCL10/interferon-gamma-inducible protein of 10 kDa, CCL3/macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha, or CCL5/RANTES (regulated on activation normal T-cell expressed and secreted) did not enhance HIV-infected leukocyte transmigration or BBB permeability. The increased capacity of HIV-infected leukocytes to transmigrate in response to CCL2 correlated with their increased expression of CCR2, the chemokine receptor for CCL2. These data suggest that CCL2, but not other chemokines, plays a key role in infiltration of HIV-infected leukocytes into the CNS and the subsequent pathology characteristic of NeuroAIDS.\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"Rapid up-regulation and higher basal expression of interferon-induced genes reduce survival of granule cell neurons that are infected by West Nile virus,\" this makes me think of the complex interplay between the immune system and viral infections, particularly how interferon-induced genes (ISGs) play a crucial role in antiviral response. The user might actually be trying to understand the specific mechanisms by which ISGs affect the survival of granule cell neurons during a West Nile virus infection. However, the terms \"rapid,\" \"higher basal,\" and \"reduce survival\" seem too broad or non-precise, which might not yield the most relevant results.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the documents retrieved provide a general understanding of ISG function in antiviral response but lack a targeted focus on the precise neuronal context of granule cells and West Nile virus. This indicates a need to refine the query to capture the specific objectives of identifying crucial ISGs for West Nile virus resistance in granule cells, investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying ISG-mediated neuroprotection, and determining the impact of altered ISG expression on granule cell survival.\n\nTo approach this systematically, I'll use the expansion technique that involves a combination of synonym replacement, conceptual expansion, contextual expansion, and domain-specific terminology. The first step is to identify ineffective terms and avoid them in the expanded query. Terms like \"rapid,\" \"higher basal,\" and \"reduce survival\" are not only broad but also do not contribute significantly to the specificity of the query.\n\nNext, I'll perform a breadth expansion by introducing terms that are increasingly distant concepts to the original query but still relevant. This includes terms like \"neuroinflammation,\" \"neuronal apoptosis,\" \"viral pathogenesis,\" \"immune response in CNS,\" and \"granule cell function.\" These terms help in broadening the scope of the query to potentially capture more relevant information.\n\nFollowing the breadth expansion, I'll apply a depth expansion by selecting one of the distant but important topics and going deeper into related terms. For instance, starting with \"neuroinflammation,\" I can delve deeper into concepts like \"microenvironment,\" \"glia activation,\" \"cytokine signaling,\" \"autophagy,\" and \"apoptosis pathways.\" This step is crucial for uncovering specific mechanisms and factors involved in the interaction between ISGs, West Nile virus, and granule cell neurons.\n\nAs I apply these steps, I also consider the natural thought patterns and intuitive connections that might complement the structured technique. For example, recognizing the importance of the microenvironment in neuronal infections might lead me to consider how different cell types within the brain, such as glial cells, interact with neurons during an infection. Similarly, understanding the role of cytokine signaling in neuroinflammation could intuitively suggest looking into specific cytokines that are known to play roles in antiviral responses within the CNS.\n\nThrough this process, insights emerge from both the structured approach and natural intuition. Applying specific aspects of the technique leads to the discovery of terms like \"interferon-induced genes,\" \"West Nile virus,\" \"granule cells,\" \"neuroinflammation,\" \"cytokine signaling,\" and \"autophagy\" as crucial for the expanded query. These terms not only capture the explicit aspects of the user's query but also implicit aspects related to the molecular mechanisms and neuroprotective effects relevant to the survival of granule cell neurons during West Nile virus infection.\n\nSynthesizing this information with clarity, I conclude that the augmented query should include terms that reflect the depth and breadth of the concepts involved, ensuring they are diverse, unique, and relevant to the original query without overlapping with the original terms. The final terms for the augmented query are \"interferon induced genes west nile virus granule cells neuroinflammation cytokine signaling autophagy.\" These terms are selected based on their precision, relevance, and ability to capture the complex interactions between ISGs, West Nile virus, and the survival of granule cell neurons, thereby enhancing the search for targeted and meaningful results.",
