  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: Granulomas are the pathological hallmark of tuberculosis (TB). However, their function and mechanisms of formation remain poorly understood. To understand the role of granulomas in TB, we analyzed the proteomes of granulomas from subjects with tuberculosis in an unbiased manner. Using laser-capture microdissection, mass spectrometry and confocal microscopy, we generated detailed molecular maps of human granulomas. We found that the centers of granulomas have a pro-inflammatory environment that is characterized by the presence of antimicrobial peptides, reactive oxygen species and pro-inflammatory eicosanoids. Conversely, the tissue surrounding the caseum has a comparatively anti-inflammatory signature. These findings are consistent across a set of six human subjects and in rabbits. Although the balance between systemic pro- and anti-inflammatory signals is crucial to TB disease outcome, here we find that these signals are physically segregated within each granuloma. From the protein and lipid snapshots of human and rabbit lesions analyzed here, we hypothesize that the pathologic response to TB is shaped by the precise anatomical localization of these inflammatory pathways during the development of the granuloma.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: Membrane cholesterol modulates a variety of cell signaling pathways and functions. While cholesterol depletion by high-density lipoproteins (HDLs) has potent anti-inflammatory effects in various cell types, its effects on inflammatory responses in macrophages remain elusive. Here we show overt pro-inflammatory effects of HDL-mediated passive cholesterol depletion and lipid raft disruption in murine and human primary macrophages in vitro. These pro-inflammatory effects were confirmed in vivo in peritoneal macrophages from apoA-I transgenic mice, which have elevated HDL levels. In line with these findings, the innate immune responses required for clearance of P. aeruginosa bacterial infection in lung were compromised in mice with low HDL levels. Expression analysis, ChIP-PCR, and combinatorial pharmacological and genetic intervention studies unveiled that both native and reconstituted HDL enhance Toll-like-receptor-induced signaling by activating a PKC-NF-\u03baB/STAT1-IRF1 axis, leading to increased inflammatory cytokine expression. HDL's pro-inflammatory activity supports proper functioning of macrophage immune responses.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: Early views of autoimmune disease cast IFN\u03b3 as a prototypic pro-inflammatory factor. It is now clear that IFN\u03b3 is capable of both pro- and anti-inflammatory activities with the functional outcome dependent on the physiological and pathological setting examined. Here, the major immune modulatory activities of IFN\u03b3 are reviewed and current evidence for the impact of IFN\u03b3 on pathology and regulation of several autoimmune diseases and disease models is summarized.\n",
  "thought_process": "As I begin to analyze the original query, \"The center of the granuloma in an immune cell induces a pro-inflammatory immune response,\" I find myself pondering the intricacies of immune responses and the role of granulomas within them. The query suggests a focus on understanding the specific mechanisms by which the center of an immune cell granuloma triggers a pro-inflammatory response. Immediately, terms like \"macrophages,\" \"T cells,\" and \"cytokines\" come to mind as potential key players in this process.\n\nDelving into the existing reasoning provided, it's clear that while there's an understanding of pro-inflammatory aspects within granulomas, there's a gap in direct evidence linking the granuloma center's components to the induction of a pro-inflammatory response. This tells me that our query expansion needs to carefully consider both the cellular components within the granuloma (like macrophages and T cells) and the molecular mediators of inflammation (such as TNF-alpha and IL-1beta).\n\nThe structured data provided, including the query goals, augmented query, node classes, and query nodes, offers a comprehensive framework for understanding the query's intent and the entities involved. The node classes\u2014Granuloma, Immune Cell, Cytokine, Macrophage, T cell, Inflammation, Protein, and Signal Transduction\u2014highlight the complexity and the multifaceted nature of the query. Meanwhile, the nearest neighbors, including terms like \"macrophages,\" \"TNF-alpha,\" \"IL-1beta,\" and \"T cell activation,\" indicate potential directions for expansion.\n\nGiven the expansion technique of Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal, I see the process unfolding as follows: First, analyzing the query to identify core concepts and entities, which in this case include granulomas, immune cells, and pro-inflammatory responses. The search intent is informational, aiming to understand mechanisms and components involved in the induction of a pro-inflammatory response by the granuloma center.\n\nNext, constructing a conceptual graph involves identifying core nodes (granuloma, immune cell, pro-inflammatory response), first-order connections (components of granuloma, types of immune cells), second-order connections (related concepts like inflammation pathways, immune modulation), and domain contexts (immunology, pathology). \n\nFor expansion path selection, considering synonymous terms (e.g., \"inflammatory mediators\" for \"pro-inflammatory response\"), hierarchical terms (e.g., \"cellular components\" for \"granuloma\"), compositional terms (e.g., \"cytokines\" as parts of the immune response), and contextual terms (e.g., \"tissue environment\" for \"granuloma formation\") seems promising. Domain-specific terminology, such as \"immunopathology\" or \"cellular immunology,\" could also provide valuable expansion paths.\n\nExtracting and filtering terms based on relevance, distinctiveness, specificity, and searchability will be crucial. Terms like \"macrophage polarization,\" \"T cell differentiation,\" \"cytokine signaling,\" and \"inflammation mediators\" could be high-value additions, given their relevance to the query's core concepts and their specificity in describing mechanisms within granulomas.\n\nAs I apply the conceptual graph traversal technique, I'm also drawing on natural cognitive patterns\u2014making connections between concepts, considering the context of granuloma formation and immune response, and reflecting on how these elements interact to induce a pro-inflammatory environment. The process isn't linear; it involves iterating between different levels of abstraction, from specific molecular interactions to the broader context of immune pathology.\n\nInsights begin to emerge as I see how the expansion terms could enrich the original query. For example, incorporating terms related to specific cytokines (like TNF-alpha and IL-1beta) and their signaling pathways could provide a clearer understanding of how the granuloma center induces a pro-inflammatory response. Similarly, terms related to the cellular components of granulomas (such as macrophage and T cell subsets) could offer insights into the cellular mechanisms at play.\n\nThrough this process of applying Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal and exploring related threads, I believe the expanded query could effectively capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking. The final set of expansion terms should logically emerge from both the technique and natural insights, aiming to improve document retrieval by incorporating a balanced set of terms that reflect the complexity of granuloma-induced pro-inflammatory immune responses.\n\nThe key will be to ensure that the expanded terms maintain the original search intent while providing valuable alternative pathways for retrieval. This involves a careful synthesis of the insights gained, filtering out terms that might not contribute significantly to the query's focus, and weighting the remaining terms appropriately to construct an augmented query that is both informative and precise.\n\nIn synthesizing the findings with clarity, the final expanded query should reflect a thoughtful integration of the original query, the insights from the conceptual graph traversal,",
