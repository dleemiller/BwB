  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: The T-cell receptor (TCR) consists of a TCR\u03b1\u03b2 heterodimer, a TCR\u03b6 homodimer, and CD3\u03b3\u03b5 and CD3\u03b4\u03b5 heterodimers. The precise mechanism of T-cell triggering following TCR ligand engagement remains elusive. Previous studies reported that the cytoplasmic tail of CD3\u03b5 binds to the plasma membrane through a basic residue-rich stretch (BRS) and proposed that dissociation from the membrane is required for phosphorylation thereof. In this report we show that BRS motifs within the cytoplasmic tail of TCR\u03b6 mediate association with the plasma membrane and that TCR engagement results in TCR\u03b6 dissociation from the membrane. This dissociation requires phosphorylation of the TCR\u03b6 immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs by lymphocyte cell-specificprotein tyrosine kinase (Lck) but not \u03b6-chain-associated protein kinase 70 binding. Mutations of the TCR\u03b6 BRS motifs that disrupt this membrane association attenuate proximal and distal responses induced by TCR engagement. These mutations appear to alter the localization of TCR\u03b6 with respect to Lck as well as the mobility of the TCR complex. This study reveals that tyrosine phosphorylation of the TCR\u03b6 cytoplasmic domain regulates its association with the plasma membrane and highlights the functional importance of TCR\u03b6 BRS motifs.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: The CD3\u03b5 and \u03b6 cytoplasmic domains of the T cell receptor bind to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane (PM), and a previous nuclear magnetic resonance structure showed that both tyrosines of the CD3\u03b5 immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif partition into the bilayer. Electrostatic interactions between acidic phospholipids and clusters of basic CD3\u03b5 residues were previously shown to be essential for CD3\u03b5 and \u03b6 membrane binding. Phosphatidylserine (PS) is the most abundant negatively charged lipid on the inner leaflet of the PM and makes a major contribution to membrane binding by the CD3\u03b5 cytoplasmic domain. Here, we show that TCR triggering by peptide--MHC complexes induces dissociation of the CD3\u03b5 cytoplasmic domain from the plasma membrane. Release of the CD3\u03b5 cytoplasmic domain from the membrane is accompanied by a substantial focal reduction in negative charge and available PS in TCR microclusters. These changes in the lipid composition of TCR microclusters even occur when TCR signaling is blocked with a Src kinase inhibitor. Local changes in the lipid composition of TCR microclusters thus render the CD3\u03b5 cytoplasmic domain accessible during early stages of T cell activation.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: Tcell antigen receptor (TCR) ligation initiates tyrosine kinase activation, signaling complex assembly, and immune synapse formation. Here, we studied the kinetics and mechanics of signaling complex formation in live Jurkat leukemic T cells using signaling proteins fluorescently tagged with variants of enhanced GFP (EGFP). Within seconds of contacting coverslips coated with stimulatory antibodies, T cells developed small, dynamically regulated clusters which were enriched in the TCR, phosphotyrosine, ZAP-70, LAT, Grb2, Gads, and SLP-76, excluded the lipid raft marker enhanced yellow fluorescent protein\u2013GPI, and were competent to induce calcium elevations. LAT, Grb2, and Gads were transiently associated with the TCR. Although ZAP-70\u2013containing clusters persisted for more than 20 min, photobleaching studies revealed that ZAP-70 continuously dissociated from and returned to these complexes. Strikingly, SLP-76 translocated to a perinuclear structure after clustering with the TCR. Our results emphasize the dynamically changing composition of signaling complexes and indicate that these complexes can form within seconds of TCR engagement, in the absence of either lipid raft aggregation or the formation of a central TCR-rich cluster.\n",
  "thought_process": "As I delve into the original query, \"ITAM phosphorylation prevents the transfer of the T cell receptor (TCR) signal from the ectodomain to the cytoplasmic tail of the T cell receptor (TCR),\" I'm immediately struck by the specificity and complexity of the topic. This makes me think of the intricate mechanisms involved in TCR signaling and how ITAM phosphorylation fits into this process. The user might be trying to understand the precise role of ITAM phosphorylation in this context, possibly looking for insights into how it affects the overall immune response or the implications for immunotherapy.\n\nAnalyzing the initial results, particularly the text snippets from documents at positions k=1, k=2, and k=10, reveals a wealth of information about the TCR structure, the involvement of tyrosine kinases like Lck, and the dynamic changes in signaling complexes upon TCR engagement. Strengths of these results include their focus on the molecular mechanisms of TCR signaling and ITAM phosphorylation, offering detailed insights into the processes at play. However, a weakness might be the lack of explicit connections to the broader context of immune cell signaling and the potential for therapeutic applications.\n\nTransitioning to a more structured approach, I'll employ the Conceptual Graph Traversal technique for query expansion. This technique involves constructing a conceptual graph that represents the relationships between entities, concepts, and their attributes, and then traversing this graph to identify relevant expansion terms. The justification for using this technique lies in its ability to systematically uncover semantic connections that might not be immediately apparent, thus enhancing the query's effectiveness in retrieving relevant documents.\n\nApplying the Conceptual Graph Traversal technique, I start by identifying core concepts and entities from the original query, such as ITAM, TCR, ectodomain, cytoplasmic tail, and phosphorylation. The search intent is informational, aiming to understand the role of ITAM phosphorylation in TCR signaling. Implicit assumptions include the importance of tyrosine kinases and the structural components of the TCR in this process.\n\nConstructing the conceptual graph, core nodes include ITAM, TCR, and phosphorylation. First-order connections involve the relationships between these entities, such as ITAM phosphorylation affecting TCR signaling. Second-order connections might include related concepts like tyrosine kinases (e.g., Lck), co-receptors (e.g., CD4, CD8), and the immunological synapse. Domain contexts encompass immunology, cell biology, and signal transduction.\n\nFor expansion path selection, promising directions include synonymous terms (e.g., \"ITAM phosphorylation\" and \"tyrosine-based activation motif phosphorylation\"), hierarchical terms (broader concepts like \"immune cell signaling\" or narrower concepts such as \"TCR\u03b6 chain phosphorylation\"), compositional terms (parts of the TCR complex), contextual terms (settings like \"immunological synapse\"), and domain-specific terminology (field-specific variants like \"lymphocyte cell-specific protein tyrosine kinase\").\n\nExtracting and filtering terms, high-value expansion terms could include \"tyrosine kinase,\" \"Src family kinases,\" \"ZAP-70,\" \"TCR complex,\" \"co-receptors,\" \"immunological synapse,\" and \"signal transduction.\" These terms are relevant, distinctive, specific, and searchable, making them suitable for enhancing the query.\n\nAs I balance the structured approach with natural thought patterns, I notice that considering the dynamic nature of signaling complexes and the role of lipid rafts in TCR signaling could provide additional insights. This reminds me of the importance of the immunological synapse in facilitating interactions between T cells and antigen-presenting cells, which could be another pathway to explore.\n\nThrough this process, insights emerge from both the structured technique and intuitive connections. Applying the Conceptual Graph Traversal approach leads to the discovery of terms like \"tyrosine phosphorylation\" and \"immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs,\" which are directly related to ITAM phosphorylation and TCR signaling. Intuitively, recognizing the significance of the TCR's structural components and the involvement of co-receptors in signaling strengthens the query's focus on the molecular mechanisms underlying ITAM phosphorylation's effect on signal transfer.\n\nSynthesizing these findings, I believe the expanded query should incorporate terms that reflect the core concepts of ITAM phosphorylation, TCR signaling, and the structural and functional aspects of the TCR complex. This includes focusing on the role of tyrosine kinases, the involvement of co-receptors, and the impact on signal transduction pathways. The final expanded query, \"Role of ITAM phosphorylation in preventing signal transfer from the ectodomain to the cytoplasmic tail of the T cell receptor (TCR) and its impact on TCR subunit association with the plasma membrane, including the involvement of tyrosine kinases and co-re",
