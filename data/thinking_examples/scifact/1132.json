  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n... Nef did not increase the number of cell surface lipid rafts or immunological synapses. Recently, studies have shown a specific interaction of Nef with an active subpopulation of p21-activated kinase-2 found only in the lipid rafts. Thus, the corecruitment of Nef and key cellular partners (e.g., activated p21-activated kinase-2) into the immunological synapse may underlie the increased frequency of cells expressing transcriptionally active forms of NF-kappaB and NFAT and the resultant changes in T cell activation.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: How membrane receptors initiate signal transduction upon ligand binding is a matter of intense scrutiny. The T cell receptor complex (TCR-CD3) is composed of TCR alpha/beta ligand binding subunits bound to the CD3 subunits responsible for signal transduction. Although it has long been speculated that TCR-CD3 may undergo a conformational change, confirmation is still lacking. We present strong evidence that ligand engagement of TCR-CD3 induces a conformational change that exposes a proline-rich sequence in CD3 epsilon and results in recruitment of the adaptor protein Nck. This occurs earlier than and independently of tyrosine kinase activation. Finally, by interfering with Nck-CD3 epsilon association in vivo, we demonstrate that TCR-CD3 recruitment of Nck is critical for maturation of the immune synapse and for T cell activation.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: Immunization results in the differentiation of CD8+ T cells, such that they acquire effector abilities and convert into a memory pool. Priming of T cells takes place via an immunological synapse formed with an antigen-presenting cell (APC). By disrupting synaptic stability at different times, we found that the differentiation of CD8+ T cells required cell interactions beyond those made with APCs. We identified a critical differentiation period that required interactions between primed T cells. We found that T cell\u2013T cell synapses had a major role in the generation of protective CD8+ T cell memory. T cell\u2013T cell synapses allowed T cells to polarize critical secretion of interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) toward each other. Collective activation and homotypic clustering drove cytokine sharing and acted as regulatory stimuli for T cell differentiation.\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query about TCR/CD3 microdomains and their role in inducing the immunologic synapse to activate T cells, this makes me think of the complex interactions between T cells and antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Though the user might actually be trying to understand the specific mechanisms by which these microdomains facilitate T cell activation, I'm not sure yet how deep they want to dive into the signaling pathways and molecular interactions involved.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the top documents discuss the importance of lipid rafts, immunological synapses, and signal transduction pathways in T cell activation. The strengths of these search terms lie in their ability to capture the core concepts of T cell biology, but their weaknesses might be in overlooking other crucial aspects, such as the role of co-stimulatory molecules or the kinetic engagement model of TCR signaling.\n\nTo expand this query systematically, I'll use the Conceptual Territory Mapping technique. This approach involves identifying the central coordinates of the query, exploring its boundaries, plotting key landmarks, and filling in detailed features. By doing so, I aim to create a comprehensive map of the conceptual territory surrounding TCR/CD3 microdomains and their role in T cell activation.\n\nStarting with the central coordinates, I've identified TCR/CD3 microdomains, immunological synapse formation, and T cell activation as the core components. The boundary areas include signal transduction pathways, lipid rafts, MHC-peptide complex recognition, co-stimulatory molecules, and T cell differentiation. Key landmarks in this territory include the TCR/CD3 complex, Lck kinase, PI3K and MAPK pathways, NFAT transcription factor, and cytoskeletal rearrangement.\n\nAs I delve deeper into the detail mapping phase, I notice the importance of lipid bilayer clustering, synaptic polarization, signal amplification, and co-localization of signaling proteins. The kinetic engagement model and TCR affinity tuning also emerge as critical features within this conceptual territory.\n\nNow, let me apply the systematic steps of Conceptual Territory Mapping while allowing for natural cognitive elements to influence my thought process. Following the technique, I should first explore the central coordinates and then move outward to boundary areas. Wait, that's not quite right for this query; let me adjust my approach to focus on the key landmarks and how they interconnect.\n\nThis step of the technique is revealing the intricate relationships between TCR/CD3 microdomains, immunological synapse formation, and signal transduction pathways, which actually reminds me of the related concept of synaptic plasticity in neuronal signaling. I need to consider the next step in the technique, which involves detail mapping, but I'm also noticing this interesting pattern where the kinetic engagement model of TCR signaling might be analogous to other receptor-ligand interactions in immunology.\n\nApplying the specific aspect of Conceptual Territory Mapping that involves identifying navigation terms leads me to discover terms like \"immunological synapse,\" \"T cell receptor (TCR),\" \"CD3 complex,\" \"signal transduction,\" and \"activation threshold.\" These terms emerge logically from both the technique and my natural insights into the query's conceptual territory.\n\nThrough this process of applying Conceptual Territory Mapping and exploring related threads, I believe the expanded query should include terms that capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of T cell activation via TCR/CD3 microdomains. The final expanded query, \"tcr cd3 microdomains signal transduction pathways immunological synapse formation cell activation,\" reflects a balance between the structured technique and my intuitive understanding of the query's underlying concepts.",
