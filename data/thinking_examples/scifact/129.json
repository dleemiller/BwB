He even administered a supplementary questionnaire to assess whether authors choosing the OA option in PNAS chose to do so for only their most important research (they didn't). As Ian Rowlands from the Centre for Publishing at University College London\u2014and one of the reviewers who agreed to be identified in this article\u2014said at the start of his review:          \u201cMany (most) of the papers and presentations I have read/seen on this topic have completely failed to address the kinds of confounding issues that are so convincingly tackled here. For that reason alone, this paper deserves to be published and alerted to the widest possible audience. \u201d          In addition to providing evidence for the immediate advantage of open access, Eysenbach's analysis also highlights several potential challenges to its long-term future. Although a limited dataset, the citation history of the first and last authors differed between those who chose the open-access option and those who did not. ...\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n... Groups 1 and 3 were asked to sign their reports, while groups 2 and 4 were asked to return their reports unsigned. The fifth group was sent the paper in the usual manner of the journal, with authors' identities revealed and a request to comment anonymously. Group 5 differed from group 4 only in that its members were unaware that they were taking part in a study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE The number of weaknesses in the paper that were commented on by the reviewers. RESULTS Reports were received from 221 reviewers (53%). The mean number of weaknesses commented on was 2 (1.7, 2.1, 1.8, and 1.9 for groups 1, 2, 3, and 4 and 5 combined, respectively). There were no statistically significant differences between groups in their performance. Reviewers who were blinded to authors' dentities were less likely to recommend rejection than those who were aware of the authors' identities (odds ratio, 0.5; 95% confidence interval, 0.3-1.0). CONCLUSIONS Neither blinding reviewers to the authors and origin of the paper nor requiring them to sign their reports had any effect on rate of detection of errors. Such measures are unlikely to improve the quality of peer review reports.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: Notch signals are necessary for the functional outcomes of T cell receptor \u03b2-selection, including differentiation, proliferation and rescue from apoptosis. The mechanism underlying this requirement for T cell development is unknown. Here we show that Notch receptor and Delta-like 1 ligand interactions promoted the survival of CD4\u2212CD8\u2212 pre\u2013T cells through the maintenance of cell size, glucose uptake and metabolism. Furthermore, the trophic effects of Notch signaling were mediated by the pathway of phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase and the kinase Akt, such that expression of active Atk overcame the requirement for Notch in \u03b2-selection. Collectively, our results demonstrate involvement of Notch receptor\u2013ligand interactions in the regulation of cellular metabolism, thus enabling the autonomous signaling capacity of the pre\u2013T cell receptor complex.*Note: In the version of this article initially published online, in the fourth sentence of the abstract, the term \"Atk\" was a misspelling; this should be \"Akt. \" In the fourth sentence of the second paragraph of the introduction, the name of the second kinase mentioned, \"PI(3)K-dependent kinase 1,\" was incorrect; this should read \"phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1. \" These errors have been corrected for the HTML and print versions of the article.\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"Articles published in open access format are less likely to be cited than traditional journals,\" this makes me think of the potential barriers to visibility or recognition faced by open access publications. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the underlying factors influencing scholarly impact, I'm not sure yet what specific aspects they're most interested in.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the terms \"published\" and \"articles\" might be too broad and ineffective for yielding precise insights. The text snippets from the initial results provide some clues, such as the discussion on open access, peer review, and citation practices. However, to dive deeper, I need a structured approach.\n\nLet me approach this using the given expansion technique, which involves being specific and diverse, applying varied augmentation techniques like synonym replacement, conceptual expansion, and domain-specific terminology. This should help because it will allow me to systematically explore related concepts and identify new, relevant terms.\n\nFollowing the technique, I first elucidate the primary objectives of the query, which seem to be understanding citation disparities and identifying factors affecting scholarly impact. Next, I identify ineffective terms like \"published\" and \"articles\" that should be avoided. Then, I move on to breadth expansion, considering terms like \"impact factor,\" \"peer review,\" \"visibility,\" and \"research funding.\" \n\nOne of these terms, \"visibility,\" catches my attention as a crucial factor that could influence citation rates. Delving deeper into this concept, I explore related terms such as \"discoverability,\" \"search engine optimization,\" \"metadata standards,\" and \"online platforms.\" These terms seem to capture the essence of how open access articles can be made more visible and, consequently, more likely to be cited.\n\nAs I apply the technique, I also allow for natural thought patterns to emerge. I reconsider the importance of \"peer review\" in the context of open access publications and how it might affect their credibility and citation rates. Intuitive connections lead me to think about \"citation practices\" and how they might vary across different fields and journals. Brief tangents, such as considering the role of \"digital repositories\" and \"scholarly communication,\" sometimes yield unexpected insights into the dissemination of research findings.\n\nStepping back to reassess, I realize that the terms emerging from this process\u2014such as \"impact factor,\" \"peer review,\" \"discoverability,\" \"search engine optimization,\" \"metadata standards,\" \"online platforms,\" and \"citation practices\"\u2014capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking. These terms are diverse, unique, and targeted, avoiding logical operators and ineffective words, making them suitable for a BM25 index.\n\nThrough this process of applying the expansion technique and exploring related threads, I believe these terms would be most effective for understanding the disparities in citation rates between open access and traditional journals. They open up new dimensions for inquiry, focusing on the intricacies of scholarly communication, the role of technology in research dissemination, and the metrics used to evaluate research impact.",
