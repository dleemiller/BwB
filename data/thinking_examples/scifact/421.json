  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: Stiffness is a biophysical property of the extracellular matrix that modulates cellular functions, including proliferation, invasion, and differentiation, and it also may affect therapeutic responses. Therapeutic durability in cancer treatments remains a problem for both chemotherapies and pathway-targeted drugs, but the reasons for this are not well understood. Tumor progression is accompanied by changes in the biophysical properties of the tissue, and we asked whether matrix rigidity modulated the sensitive versus resistant states in HER2-amplified breast cancer cell responses to the HER2-targeted kinase inhibitor lapatinib. The antiproliferative effect of lapatinib was inversely proportional to the elastic modulus of the adhesive substrata. Down-regulation of the mechanosensitive transcription coactivators YAP and TAZ, either by siRNA or with the small-molecule YAP/TEAD inhibitor verteporfin, eliminated modulus-dependent lapatinib resistance. Reduction of YAP in vivo in mice also slowed the growth of implanted HER2-amplified tumors, showing a trend of increasing sensitivity to lapatinib as YAP decreased. Thus we address the role of stiffness in resistance to and efficacy of a HER2 pathway-targeted therapeutic via the mechanotransduction arm of the Hippo pathway.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: T cell activation is predicated on the interaction between the T cell receptor and peptide-major histocompatibility (pMHC) ligands. The factors that determine the stimulatory potency of a pMHC molecule remain unclear. We describe results showing that a peptide exhibiting many hallmarks of a weak agonist stimulates T cells to proliferate more than the wild-type agonist ligand. An in silico approach suggested that the inability to form the central supramolecular activation cluster (cSMAC) could underlie the increased proliferation. This conclusion was supported by experiments that showed that enhancing cSMAC formation reduced stimulatory capacity of the weak peptide. Our studies highlight the fact that a complex interplay of factors determines the quality of a T cell antigen.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: Statins are potent inhibitors of cholesterol biosynthesis. In clinical trials, statins are beneficial in the primary and secondary prevention of coronary heart disease. However, the overall benefits observed with statins appear to be greater than what might be expected from changes in lipid levels alone, suggesting effects beyond cholesterol lowering. Indeed, recent studies indicate that some of the cholesterol-independent or \"pleiotropic\" effects of statins involve improving endothelial function, enhancing the stability of atherosclerotic plaques, decreasing oxidative stress and inflammation, and inhibiting the thrombogenic response. Furthermore, statins have beneficial extrahepatic effects on the immune system, CNS, and bone. Many of these pleiotropic effects are mediated by inhibition of isoprenoids, which serve as lipid attachments for intracellular signaling molecules. In particular, inhibition of small GTP-binding proteins, Rho, Ras, and Rac, whose proper membrane localization and function are dependent on isoprenylation, may play an important role in mediating the pleiotropic effects of statins.\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"Flexible molecules experience greater steric hindrance in the tumor microenvironment than rigid molecules,\" this makes me think of how the shape and flexibility of molecules can affect their interaction with the complex environment of a tumor. Though the user might actually be trying to understand how this impacts drug delivery and efficacy, I'm not sure yet what specific aspects they're most interested in. The mention of steric hindrance and the comparison between flexible and rigid molecules in the context of a tumor microenvironment suggests a very specific biochemical or pharmacological question.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I see that they touch upon relevant areas like drug resistance and cellular behavior within tumors, but they lack a direct focus on the impact of molecular rigidity/flexibility on steric effects in this context. This tells me that while we have some relevant information, we need to delve deeper into the specifics of how molecular structure affects its interaction with the tumor environment.\n\nTo approach this systematically, I'll use the Conceptual Territory Mapping technique. This involves identifying the central point of the query, exploring its boundaries, mapping key landmarks, detailing specific features, and finally, creating a cartographic legend of the most important terms.\n\nThe central point of our query seems to be the concept of steric hindrance as it relates to flexible vs. rigid molecules in a tumor microenvironment. The cardinal directions from here could include exploring the interplay between molecular structure (flexibility), drug delivery and efficacy (therapeutic applications), cellular responses within the tumor microenvironment, and the physical properties of the tumor matrix.\n\nAs I explore the boundaries of this query, I notice that we're touching on areas like drug delivery systems, cancer cell signaling, tumor immunology, biomaterial properties, and pharmacokinetics. These are all relevant because they can influence or be influenced by the steric hindrance experienced by flexible molecules in a tumor.\n\nIdentifying key landmarks, I see concepts like diffusion barriers, cell membrane receptors, extracellular matrix, angiogenesis, and nanoparticle drug delivery as crucial. These are the \"cities\" on our map that we need to understand and connect.\n\nNow, detailing specific features within each region, we have aspects like size exclusion effects, conformational flexibility, molecular docking, target accessibility, and the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. These are the \"streets\" and \"buildings\" that give our map its granularity.\n\nFinally, creating a cartographic legend of the most important terms, I select terms that would help a traveler navigate this knowledge landscape. These include steric hindrance, tumor microenvironment, flexible molecules, rigid molecules, drug delivery, cell membrane, extracellular matrix, and nanoparticles.\n\nThrough this process of applying Conceptual Territory Mapping and exploring related threads, I believe the terms that would be most effective for query expansion are those that capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking. Thus, terms like \"impact of molecular flexibility on drug delivery and efficacy in the tumor microenvironment\" and \"steric hindrance of flexible vs. rigid molecules by tumor extracellular matrix\" emerge as central to our query expansion.\n\nThe final expanded query, \"impact molecular flexibility drug delivery efficacy tumor microenvironment steric hindrance flexible vs rigid molecules tumor extracellular matrix,\" reflects a synthesis of both the structured approach of Conceptual Territory Mapping and the intuitive connections made during the exploration of the query's conceptual territory.",
