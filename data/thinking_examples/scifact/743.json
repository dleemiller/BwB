  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: CONTEXT Increasing evidence supports the hypothesis of a causal association between certain bacterial infections and increased risk of developing acute myocardial infarction. If such a causal association exists, subjects who used antibiotics active against the bacteria, regardless of indication, might be at lower risk of developing acute myocardial infarction than nonusers. OBJECTIVE To determine whether previous use of antibiotics decreases the risk of developing a first-time acute myocardial infarction. DESIGN Population-based case-control analysis. SETTING The United Kingdom-based General Practice Research Database comprising 350 general practices. PATIENTS A total of 3315 case patients aged 75 years or younger with a diagnosis of first-time acute myocardial infarction between 1992 and 1997 and 13139 controls without myocardial infarction matched to cases for age, sex, general practice attended, and calendar time. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Use of antibiotics among those who did or did not have a first-time acute myocardial infarction. RESULTS Cases were significantly less likely to have used tetracycline antibiotics (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.55-0.90) or quinolones (adjusted OR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.21-0.95). ...\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: OBJECTIVE To quantify the effects of quantity and frequency of alcohol consumption on risk of acute myocardial infarction and coronary death. DESIGN Case-control study. SETTING Lower Hunter region of New South Wales, Australia, 1983-94. SUBJECTS Men and women aged 35-69 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Acute myocardial infarction or coronary death. RESULTS Alcohol consumption patterns were compared between 11,511 cases of acute myocardial infarction or coronary death and 6077 controls randomly selected from the same study population. After adjusting for the effects of age, smoking, and medical history, men and women who consumed one or two drinks of alcohol on five or six days a week had a reduction in risk of a major coronary event compared with men and women who were non-drinkers (odds ratios: men 0.31 (95% confidence interval 0.22 to 0.45); women 0.33 (0.18 to 0.59)). A similar reduction in risk was found after excluding non-drinkers who were formerly moderate to heavy drinkers. An acute protective effect of alcohol consumption was also found for regular drinkers who consumed one or two drinks in the 24 hours preceding the onset of symptoms (odds ratios: men 0.74 (0.51 to 1.09); women 0.43 (0.20 to 0.95)). CONCLUSIONS Frequency and quantity of alcohol consumption are important in assessing the risk of a major coronary event. Risk is lowest among men who report one to four drinks daily on five or six days a week and among women who report one or two drinks daily on five or six days a week.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n... RESULTS The ECV by both techniques correlated with histological CVF (n = 18, r\u00b2 = 0.69, p < 0.01 vs. r\u00b2 = 0.71, p < 0.01, p = 0.42 for comparison). Across health and disease, there was strong correlation between the techniques (r\u00b2 = 0.97). However, in diseases of high ECV (amyloid, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy late gadolinium enhancement, and infarction), Bland-Altman analysis indicates the bolus only technique has a consistent and increasing offset, giving a higher value for ECVs above 0.4 (mean difference \u00b1 limit of agreement for ECV <0.4 = -0.004 \u00b1 0.037 vs. ECV >0.4 = 0.040 \u00b1 0.075, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Bolus only, T1 mapping-derived ECV measurement is sufficient for ECV measurement across a range of cardiac diseases, and this approach is histologically validated in AS. However, when ECV is >0.4, the bolus only technique consistently measures ECV higher compared with infusion.\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"Macrolides protect against myocardial infarction,\" this makes me think of the potential mechanisms by which macrolides, a class of antibiotics, could have a protective effect against heart attacks. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the relationship between these antibiotics and cardiovascular health, I'm not sure yet how deep they want to dive into the specifics of the protective effects or if they're interested in the broader context of cardiovascular disease prevention.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the terms used are quite specific and might not capture the full scope of relevant research. For instance, the text snippets from documents at k=1 and k=2 discuss the relationship between antibiotic use and myocardial infarction risk, as well as the effects of alcohol consumption on coronary event risk. These results suggest that the query could benefit from broader exploration of cardiovascular health, potential mechanisms, and alternative treatments.\n\nTo expand this query effectively, I'll apply the expansion technique, which involves a systematic approach to identifying new, relevant terms. This technique includes steps such as synonym replacement, conceptual expansion, contextual expansion, and domain-specific terminology. By applying this technique, I aim to discover new dimensions to the query that introduce novelty and diversity without overlapping with the original terms.\n\nStarting with the task of goal elucidation and gaps, I identify that the primary objective is to understand how macrolides protect against myocardial infarction. A significant gap in the original query is its narrow focus, which might overlook important aspects of cardiovascular disease and the mechanisms through which macrolides exert their protective effects.\n\nMoving to ineffective term identification, I notice that the term \"macrolides\" is quite broad and could be refined to include specific types of macrolides or their mechanisms of action. However, the provided list of ineffective terms only mentions \"macrolides\" without suggesting alternatives, so I will consider this in the context of expanding the query.\n\nFor breadth expansion, the provided terms such as \"Cardiovascular Disease,\" \"Heart Health,\" \"Anti-inflammatory Drugs,\" \"Atherosclerosis,\" and \"Coronary Artery Disease\" offer a good starting point. These terms introduce new dimensions related to the overall context of cardiovascular health and potential pathways through which macrolides could exert protective effects.\n\nIn depth expansion, focusing on \"Atherosclerosis\" as a key topic, I can delve deeper into related terms such as \"Inflammation,\" \"Oxidative Stress,\" \"Endothelial Function,\" and \"Smooth Muscle Cell Proliferation.\" These terms are crucial in understanding the mechanistic aspects of how macrolides might influence cardiovascular health, particularly in preventing or mitigating the progression of atherosclerosis.\n\nAs I apply the expansion technique systematically, I also allow for natural cognitive patterns to emerge. For instance, considering the role of inflammation in atherosclerosis reminds me of the anti-inflammatory properties of certain macrolides, which could be a key mechanism in their protective effect against myocardial infarction. Furthermore, exploring endothelial function leads me to think about the importance of vascular health in preventing coronary events, which might not have been immediately apparent from the original query.\n\nThrough this process, insights emerge from both the structured approach and natural intuition. Applying specific aspects of the technique, such as conceptual expansion, leads to the discovery of terms like \"oxidative stress\" and \"angiogenesis,\" which are relevant to understanding the protective effects of macrolides. Additionally, my instinct suggests that considering the broader context of cardiovascular disease, including factors like diet, exercise, and stress management, could provide a more comprehensive understanding of how macrolides fit into overall heart health strategies.\n\nSynthesizing these findings with clarity, I believe the terms that would be most effective for expanding the query are those that capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking. The augmented query should reflect a balance between the original focus on macrolides and myocardial infarction, and the broader, more mechanistic insights into cardiovascular health and disease prevention. Therefore, terms such as \"cardiovascular disease,\" \"heart health,\" \"anti-inflammatory drugs,\" \"atherosclerosis,\" \"oxidative stress,\" and \"endothelial function\" are not only relevant but also targeted and precise, offering a novel and diverse set of search terms that enhance the original query without overlapping with it.",
