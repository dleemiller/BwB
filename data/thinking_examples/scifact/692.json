METHODS A meta-analysis was performed of postoperative blood loss in randomized clinical trials of hydroxyethyl starch versus albumin for fluid management in adult cardiopulmonary bypass surgery. Impacts of hydroxyethyl starch molecular weight and molar substitution were assessed. Randomized trials directly comparing different hydroxyethyl starch solutions were also included. RESULTS Eighteen trials with 970 total patients were included. Compared with albumin, hydroxyethyl starch increased postoperative blood loss by 33.3% of a pooled SD (95% confidence interval, 18.2%-48.3%; P < .001). Risk of reoperation for bleeding was more than doubled by hydroxyethyl starch (relative risk, 2.24; 95% confidence interval, 1.14-4.40; P = .020). Hydroxyethyl starch increased transfusion of red blood cells by 28.4% of a pooled SD (95% confidence interval, 12.2%-44.6%; P < .001), of fresh-frozen plasma by 30.6% (95% confidence interval, 8.0%-53.1%; P = .008), and of platelets by 29.8% (95% confidence interval, 3.4%-56.2%; P = .027). None of these effects differed significantly between hydroxyethyl starch 450/0.7 and 200/0.5. Insufficient data were available for hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 versus albumin; however, no significant differences were detected in head-to-head comparisons of hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 with 200/0.5. Albumin improved hemodynamics. ...\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n... Compared with the control period, the adjusted odds of death following leukoreduction were reduced (odds ratio [OR], 0.87; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75-0.99), but serious nosocomial infections did not decrease (adjusted OR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.87-1.09). The frequency of posttransfusion fevers decreased significantly following leukoreduction (adjusted OR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.79-0.94), as did antibiotic use (adjusted OR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.82-0.99). CONCLUSION A national universal leukoreduction program is potentially associated with decreased mortality as well as decreased fever episodes and antibiotic use after red blood cell transfusion in high-risk patients.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: Circadian (\u223c24 hour) clocks are fundamentally important for coordinated physiology in organisms as diverse as cyanobacteria and humans. All current models of the molecular circadian clockwork in eukaryotic cells are based on transcription-translation feedback loops. Non-transcriptional mechanisms in the clockwork have been difficult to study in mammalian systems. We circumvented these problems by developing novel assays using human red blood cells, which have no nucleus (or DNA) and therefore cannot perform transcription. Our results show that transcription is not required for circadian oscillations in humans, and that non-transcriptional events seem to be sufficient to sustain cellular circadian rhythms. Using red blood cells, we found that peroxiredoxins, highly conserved antioxidant proteins, undergo \u223c24-hour redox cycles, which persist for many days under constant conditions (that is, in the absence of external cues). Moreover, these rhythms are entrainable (that is, tunable by environmental stimuli) and temperature-compensated, both key features of circadian rhythms. We anticipate that our findings will facilitate more sophisticated cellular clock models, highlighting the interdependency of transcriptional and non-transcriptional oscillations in potentially all eukaryotic cells.\n",
  "thought_process": "As I begin to approach this query expansion task, my initial impression is that the original query, \"Leuko-increased blood increases infectious complications in red blood cell transfusion,\" is quite specific and targets a nuanced aspect of transfusion medicine. The focus on leucocytes (white blood cells) and their role in increasing the risk of infections during red blood cell transfusions suggests that the user is looking for detailed, possibly research-oriented information.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that while the top documents provide valuable insights into blood transfusions and related complications, they don't directly address the leucocyte-infection nexus as specified in the query. For instance, the first document discusses the effects of hydroxyethyl starch on bleeding after cardiopulmonary bypass, which, while relevant to transfusion medicine, doesn't directly explore the role of leucocytes in infectious complications. The second document, however, touches on leukoreduction and its impact on mortality and infections, showing a closer alignment with the query's intent.\n\nTo systematically expand this query, I'll apply the Conceptual Graph Traversal technique. This involves constructing a conceptual graph around the core concepts identified in the original query: leucocytes, infectious complications, and red blood cell transfusions. The first step is to identify the core nodes and their direct relationships, which include the biological role of leucocytes, the process of red blood cell transfusion, and the potential for infectious complications.\n\nNext, I'll consider first-order and second-order connections. First-order connections involve direct properties and attributes, such as the types of leucocytes (e.g., neutrophils, lymphocytes), the mechanisms of transfusion (e.g., allogenic, autologous), and common infectious complications (e.g., bacterial, viral). Second-order connections might include related concepts like immune system response, blood banking practices, and patient risk factors.\n\nFor expansion path selection, I'll focus on synonymous terms (e.g., \"white blood cells\" for leucocytes), hierarchical terms (e.g., \"hematopoietic cells\" as a broader concept), compositional terms (e.g., \"blood components\" as parts of transfused blood), contextual terms (e.g., \"transfusion medicine,\" \"hospital setting\"), and domain-specific terminology (e.g., \"leukoreduction,\" \"transfusion-related infections\").\n\nAs I extract and filter terms, I'm looking for relevance, distinctiveness, specificity, and searchability. Terms like \"leukocyte,\" \"infection risk,\" \"transfusion complications,\" and \"immune response\" emerge as strong candidates because they directly relate to the query, offer a precise focus, and are likely to appear in relevant documents.\n\nHowever, I also find myself considering tangential concepts that might initially seem off-topic but could offer valuable insights. For example, the circadian rhythm study using red blood cells, while not directly about leucocytes or infectious complications, reminds me of the importance of considering the broader physiological context in which transfusions occur. This might lead to exploring terms related to patient health status, timing of transfusions, or even the impact of blood storage conditions on leucocyte viability and function.\n\nThrough this systematic approach combined with intuitive leaps and connections, I've identified a set of terms that not only expand the query but also enrich its context. The final expanded query, \"leucocytes white blood cells infection risk complications immune response red cell transfusion,\" incorporates these insights to better capture the nuanced relationship between leucocytes, transfusions, and infectious risks.\n\nIn synthesizing this thought process, I realize that the effective expansion of a query requires a balance between structured techniques, like Conceptual Graph Traversal, and the natural, sometimes meandering paths of human thought. By embracing both, we can develop queries that are not only more comprehensive but also more likely to uncover relevant information hidden within the complexities of language and knowledge.",
