In 2010, there were an estimated 1.1 million incident cases of tuberculosis among the 34 million people living with HIV worldwide. Antiretroviral therapy has substantial potential to prevent HIV-associated tuberculosis. We conducted a systematic review of studies that analysed the impact of antiretroviral therapy on the incidence of tuberculosis in adults with HIV infection. METHODS AND FINDINGS PubMed, Embase, African Index Medicus, LILACS, and clinical trial registries were systematically searched. Randomised controlled trials, prospective cohort studies, and retrospective cohort studies were included if they compared tuberculosis incidence by antiretroviral therapy status in HIV-infected adults for a median of over 6 mo in developing countries. For the meta-analyses there were four categories based on CD4 counts at antiretroviral therapy initiation: (1) less than 200 cells/\u00b5l, (2) 200 to 350 cells/\u00b5l, (3) greater than 350 cells/\u00b5l, and (4) any CD4 count. Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria. ...\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n... RESULTS At baseline, the median CD4+ T-cell count was 150 per cubic millimeter, and the median viral load was 161,000 copies per milliliter, with no significant differences between the two groups. The incidence rate of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or death was 6.9 cases per 100 person-years in the earlier-ART group (18 cases) as compared with 7.8 per 100 person-years in the later-ART group (19 cases) (incidence-rate ratio, 0.89; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.44 to 1.79; P=0.73). However, among patients with CD4+ T-cell counts of less than 50 per cubic millimeter, the incidence rates of AIDS or death were 8.5 and 26.3 cases per 100 person-years, respectively (incidence-rate ratio, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.07 to 1.13; P=0.06). The incidence rates of the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) were 20.1 and 7.7 cases per 100 person-years, respectively (incidence-rate ratio, 2.62; 95% CI, 1.48 to 4.82; P<0.001). Adverse events requiring a switching of antiretroviral drugs occurred in 10 patients in the earlier-ART group and 1 patient in the later-ART group (P=0.006). ...\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n...

  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"Antiretroviral therapy reduces rates of tuberculosis across a broad range of CD4 strata,\" this makes me think of the complex relationship between HIV, antiretroviral therapy (ART), and tuberculosis (TB). The user might actually be trying to understand how ART impacts TB rates in different patient populations, particularly those with varying CD4 counts. It seems like a very specific inquiry, but there's potential for broadening the scope to include long-term effects, drug resistance, and co-morbidities.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that terms like \"broad\" and \"rates\" are quite generic and might not contribute much to the specificity of the search. The text snippets from the initial results provide valuable insights into the relationship between ART, CD4 counts, and TB incidence. For instance, the systematic review mentioned in the first snippet highlights the potential of ART in preventing HIV-associated TB, especially in adults with HIV infection. This suggests that our query expansion should consider the efficacy of ART across different CD4 strata and possibly delve into the specifics of HIV-associated TB.\n\nTo approach this systematically, I'll use the expansion technique provided, focusing on discovering new, relevant documents across various domains without overlapping the original terms. This involves being specific and diverse, applying techniques like synonym replacement, conceptual expansion, contextual expansion, and domain-specific terminology.\n\nStarting with goal elucidation and gaps, the primary objective is to understand the impact of ART on TB rates across different CD4 levels. A gap in the current query is its focus on a broad range of CD4 strata without specifying the exact mechanisms or outcomes of interest.\n\nFor ineffective term identification, \"broad\" and \"rates\" stand out as terms that could be more precise. In the context of this query, using more specific terms related to CD4 counts, TB incidence, and ART outcomes could enhance the search.\n\nBreadth expansion leads to candidate terms such as \"TB treatment,\" \"HIV-associated TB,\" \"immunodeficiency,\" \"infection control,\" and \"public health interventions.\" These terms introduce new dimensions to the query, moving beyond the original focus on ART and TB rates.\n\nChoosing \"infection control\" as a distant but important topic for depth expansion, we can delve deeper into related terms such as \"drug-resistant TB,\" \"multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB),\" and \"extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB).\" This depth expansion provides a nuanced understanding of the challenges in TB treatment and control, especially in the context of HIV infection.\n\nApplying the expansion technique and considering the insights from the initial results, the augmented query should include terms that are specific, diverse, and relevant to the original query without duplicating original terms. The terms \"antiretroviral therapy,\" \"tuberculosis,\" \"CD4,\" \"HIV,\" \"MDR-TB,\" and \"XDR-TB\" emerge as key components of the augmented query, capturing both the explicit and implicit aspects of the user's inquiry.\n\nThrough this process of applying the expansion technique and exploring related threads, I believe the final augmented query effectively balances structured approach and natural cognitive patterns. It not only enhances the original query by introducing new dimensions and specificity but also ensures that the search terms are high-quality, unique, and relevant to the context of ART, TB, and HIV.\n\nThe thought process involved a systematic approach to query expansion, starting with understanding the query's objectives and gaps, identifying ineffective terms, and then applying breadth and depth expansion techniques. This process was complemented by natural cognitive elements such as reconsiderations, intuitive connections, and brief tangents that sometimes yielded unexpected insights. The final augmented query synthesizes these elements to provide a clear and effective search strategy.",
