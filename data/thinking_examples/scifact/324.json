  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: The PI3K-Akt-mTORC1 axis contributes to the activation, survival, and proliferation of CD4(+) T cells upon stimulation through TCR and CD28. Here, we demonstrate that the suppression of this axis by deletion of p85\u03b1 or PI3K/mTORC1 inhibitors as well as T cell-specific deletion of raptor, an essential component of mTORC1, impairs Th17 differentiation in vitro and in vivo in a S6K1/2-dependent fashion. Inhibition of PI3K-Akt-mTORC1-S6K1 axis impairs the downregulation of Gfi1, a negative regulator of Th17 differentiation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that S6K2, a nuclear counterpart of S6K1, is induced by the PI3K-Akt-mTORC1 axis, binds ROR\u03b3, and carries ROR\u03b3 to the nucleus. These results point toward a pivotal role of PI3K-Akt-mTORC1-S6K1/2 axis in Th17 differentiation.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n... The results showed that the levels of miR-21 target genes of PTEN, RECK and PDCD4 were up-regulated at protein levels. Therefore, we concluded that the exosomal miR-21 levels could be demonstrated as a promising indicator for glioma diagnosis and prognosis, particularly with values to predict tumor recurrence or metastasis.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: Myelin-directed autoimmunity is considered to play a key role in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS). Increased production of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines is a common finding in MS. Interleukin-17 (IL-17) is a recently described cytokine produced in humans almost exclusively by activated memory T cells, which can induce the production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines from parenchymal cells and macrophages. In situ hybridisation with synthetic oligonucleotide probes was adopted to detect and enumerate IL-17 mRNA expressing mononuclear cells (MNC) in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patients with MS and control individuals. Numbers of IL-17 mRNA expressing blood MNC were higher in patients with MS and acute aseptic meningoencephalitis (AM) compared to healthy individuals. Higher numbers of IL-17 mRNA expressing blood MNC were detected in MS patients examined during clinical exacerbation compared to remission. Patients with MS had higher numbers of IL-17 mRNA expressing MNC in CSF compared to blood. This increase in numbers of IL-17 mRNA expressing MNC in CSF was not observed in patients with AM. Our results thus demonstrate increased numbers of IL-17 mRNA expressing MNC in MS with higher numbers in CSF than blood, and with the highest numbers in blood during clinical exacerbations.\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"Deleting Raptor reduces G-CSF levels,\" this makes me think of the complex interplay between cellular mechanisms and immunological responses. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the therapeutic implications of this relationship, the query itself hints at a deeper exploration of how Raptor influences G-CSF production. Hmm, not sure yet how these components interact, but it seems like delving into the mTOR signaling pathway could provide some insights.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the top documents discuss the role of the PI3K-Akt-mTORC1 axis in T cell differentiation and the impact of inhibiting this pathway on Th17 differentiation. This suggests that Raptor, as a component of mTORC1, might play a crucial role in regulating immune responses, potentially affecting G-CSF levels indirectly. However, the connection between Raptor deletion and G-CSF production isn't explicitly addressed in these initial results. \n\nTo approach this query expansion systematically, I'll apply the \"Query Expansion Through Journalistic Investigation\" technique. This involves treating the query like a story that needs to be fleshed out with real-world contexts, expert insights, and critical terms. \n\nFirst, I assess the query to understand what the user is truly seeking. Beneath the surface, the user wants to know how Raptor deletion affects G-CSF levels, which implies an interest in the underlying biological mechanisms and possibly the therapeutic implications of manipulating Raptor for immune modulation.\n\nNext, I identify diverse real-world scenarios where this query is relevant. This could include professional contexts like immunology research, educational settings where students learn about cellular signaling pathways, personal situations involving immune disorders, and specialized communities of immunologists or researchers studying cytokine regulation.\n\nFor resource investigation, I look for authoritative sources on Raptor, G-CSF, and the mTOR signaling pathway. Notable experts in immunology, established methodologies for studying cellular signaling, and essential terminology like \"Th17 differentiation\" and \"cytokine regulation\" are all crucial. Organizations like the National Institutes of Health (NIH) or the Immunology Society could provide valuable resources and expert opinions.\n\nCreating headlines for articles that could address the query from multiple angles helps to extract specific terms related to the query. Headlines like \"Raptor's Role in Immune Response: A Deep Dive into mTOR Signaling\" or \"Therapeutic Targeting of Raptor for G-CSF Modulation: Promises and Challenges\" suggest terms like \"mTOR signaling pathway,\" \"immune cell function,\" and \"therapeutic applications\" are relevant.\n\nNow, applying the steps of the journalistic investigation technique, I start to see a pattern. The initial query lacked direct evidence on Raptor's impact on G-CSF levels, but by exploring real-world contexts and expert resources, terms like \"mTOR signaling pathway\" and \"immune cell function\" emerge as critical. This systematic approach, combined with my intuitive understanding of biological systems, suggests that the expanded query should indeed include these terms to capture the complexity of the user's information need.\n\nAs I reflect on the process, it becomes clear that balancing structured technique with natural cognitive patterns is essential. The technique provides a systematic way to uncover relevant terms and contexts, while my natural thought process allows for making connections between seemingly disparate pieces of information, like the role of Raptor in Th17 differentiation and its potential impact on G-CSF production.\n\nThrough this process of applying the journalistic investigation technique and exploring related threads, I believe the terms \"Raptor,\" \"G-CSF,\" \"mTOR signaling pathway,\" and \"immune cell function\" are most relevant for expanding the original query. These terms capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, from the biological mechanisms underlying Raptor's influence on G-CSF levels to the potential therapeutic implications of this relationship.",
