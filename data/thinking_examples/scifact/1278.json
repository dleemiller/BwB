  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n... These data provide a comprehensive preclinical characterization of nivolumab, for which antitumor activity and safety have been demonstrated in human clinical trials in various solid tumors.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n... Subgroup analyses based on each characteristic (study population, previous tuberculosis treated, human immunodeficiency virus prevalence, and length of treatment) did not show any significant difference between groups. Additionally, among 1519 patients who developed ADEs with available data of impact on MDR-TB therapy, 70.4% required change of MDR-TB treatment. Adverse events were common among MDR-TB cases, occurring in more than half of the cases, with over two-thirds requiring change of anti-MDR-TB treatment. MDR-TB patients should be monitored closely and managed aggressively for side effects during therapy, especially for ototoxicity and psychiatric disorders.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: Immune tolerance and activation depend on precise control over the number and function of immunosuppressive Foxp3(+) regulatory T (T reg) cells, and the importance of IL-2 in maintaining tolerance and preventing autoimmunity is clear. However, the homeostatic requirement for IL-2 among specific populations of peripheral T reg cells remains poorly understood. We show that IL-2 selectively maintains a population of quiescent CD44(lo)CD62L(hi) T reg cells that gain access to paracrine IL-2 produced in the T cell zones of secondary lymphoid tissues due to their expression of the chemokine receptor CCR7. In contrast, CD44(hi)CD62L(lo)CCR7(lo) T reg cells that populate nonlymphoid tissues do not access IL-2-prevalent regions in vivo and are insensitive to IL-2 blockade; instead, their maintenance depends on continued signaling through the co-stimulatory receptor ICOS (inducible co-stimulator). Thus, we define a fundamental homeostatic subdivision in T reg cell populations based on their localization and provide an integrated framework for understanding how T reg cell abundance and function are controlled by unique signals in different tissue environments.\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"The treatment of cancer patients with co-IR blockade does not cause any adverse autoimmune events,\" this makes me think of the complexities of immunotherapy and its potential side effects. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the safety profile of a specific cancer treatment, the query seems to be focused on the absence of autoimmune events, which could be a critical concern for patients undergoing such treatments. \n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the top documents discuss various aspects of immunotherapy, including its application in cancer treatment, potential side effects, and the importance of managing these side effects, especially in patients with compromised immune systems. The strengths of the search terms lie in their specificity to cancer treatment and immunotherapy, while the weaknesses might include the broadness of the term \"autoimmune events,\" which could encompass a wide range of conditions.\n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here, but let me approach this using the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal technique, which involves constructing a conceptual graph based on the core concepts and entities in the original query and then traversing this graph to find high-value expansion terms. This should help because it allows for a systematic exploration of related concepts and terms that could enhance the query's precision and recall.\n\nFollowing the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal approach, I should first identify the core concepts and entities in the query, which are \"cancer treatment,\" \"co-IR blockade,\" and \"autoimmune events.\" The search intent appears to be informational, seeking to understand the relationship between a specific medical intervention and its potential side effects. There's an implicit assumption that co-IR blockade is a form of immunotherapy, which might not be immediately clear to all users.\n\nAs I construct the conceptual graph, I include core nodes for \"cancer treatment,\" \"immunotherapy,\" and \"autoimmune events.\" First-order connections involve the relationship between these treatments and their effects on the immune system, as well as the specific context of cancer. Second-order connections might include related concepts like \"immunosuppression,\" \"immune checkpoint inhibitors,\" and \"regulatory T cells.\" Domain contexts include oncology and immunology.\n\nFor expansion path selection, I identify several promising directions: synonymous terms (e.g., \"immunotherapy\" could also be referred to as \"biologic therapy\"), hierarchical terms (broader concepts like \"cancer management\" or narrower concepts like \"PD-1/PD-L1 blockade\"), compositional terms (components of the immune system affected by co-IR blockade), contextual terms (settings where this treatment is applied, such as \"clinical trials\"), and domain-specific terminology (technical terms used in oncology and immunology).\n\nAs I extract and filter terms, I look for relevance, distinctiveness, specificity, and searchability. Terms like \"nivolumab,\" \"PD-1/PD-L1 blockade,\" \"CTLA-4 blockade,\" and \"immune tolerance\" emerge as high-value terms because they are closely related to the original query, provide specific insights into the mechanisms and effects of co-IR blockade, and are likely to appear in relevant documents.\n\nApplying the specific aspect of the technique involving the analysis of second-order connections leads me to discover terms like \"regulatory T cells\" and \"immune homeostasis,\" which are crucial for understanding how co-IR blockade might influence autoimmune events. This realization connects to what we were exploring earlier regarding the importance of managing side effects in immunotherapy, suggesting that terms related to \"immunosuppressive therapy\" and \"autoimmune disease management\" could also be relevant.\n\nThrough this process of applying Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal and exploring related threads, I believe the terms that would be most effective for expanding the query are those that capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking. These include \"cancer immunotherapy,\" \"immune checkpoint inhibitors,\" \"autoimmune disease,\" \"regulatory T cells,\" \"immunosuppressive therapy,\" and \"clinical trials.\" These terms maintain the original search intent while providing valuable alternative pathways for retrieval, enhancing the query's ability to find relevant documents discussing the safety profile of co-IR blockade in cancer treatment concerning autoimmune events.",
