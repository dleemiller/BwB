Therefore, a potential use for 3DFC is the repair of myocardial tissue damaged by infarction.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: The budding yeast kinetochore is ~68 nm in length with a diameter slightly larger than a 25 nm microtubule. The kinetochores from the 16 chromosomes are organized in a stereotypic cluster encircling central spindle microtubules. Quantitative analysis of the inner kinetochore cluster (Cse4, COMA) reveals structural features not apparent in singly attached kinetochores. The cluster of Cse4-containing kinetochores is physically larger perpendicular to the spindle axis relative to the cluster of Ndc80 molecules. If there was a single Cse4 (molecule or nucleosome) at the kinetochore attached to each microtubule plus end, the cluster of Cse4 would appear geometrically identical to Ndc80. Thus, the structure of the inner kinetochore at the surface of the chromosomes remains unsolved. We have used point fluorescence microscopy and statistical probability maps to deduce the two-dimensional mean position of representative components of the yeast kinetochore relative to the mitotic spindle in metaphase. Comparison of the experimental images to three-dimensional architectures from convolution of mathematical models reveals a pool of Cse4 radially displaced from Cse4 at the kinetochore and kinetochore microtubule plus ends. ...\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: OBJECTIVES The objective of this article is to update previous evidence-based recommendations for evaluation and management of individuals with solid pulmonary nodules and to generate new recommendations for those with nonsolid nodules. METHODS We updated prior literature reviews, synthesized evidence, and formulated recommendations by using the methods described in the \"Methodology for Development of Guidelines for Lung Cancer\" in the American College of Chest Physicians Lung Cancer Guidelines, 3rd ed. RESULTS We formulated recommendations for evaluating solid pulmonary nodules that measure > 8 mm in diameter, solid nodules that measure \u2264 8 mm in diameter, and subsolid nodules. The recommendations stress the value of assessing the probability of malignancy, the utility of imaging tests, the need to weigh the benefits and harms of different management strategies (nonsurgical biopsy, surgical resection, and surveillance with chest CT imaging), and the importance of eliciting patient preferences. CONCLUSIONS Individuals with pulmonary nodules should be evaluated and managed by estimating the probability of malignancy, performing imaging tests to better characterize the lesions, evaluating the risks associated with various management alternatives, and eliciting their preferences for management.\n",
  "thought_process": "As I begin to analyze the original query, \"Arterioles have a larger lumen diameter than venules,\" I'm struck by the specificity of the comparison between these two types of blood vessels. The user is clearly looking for information on the anatomical differences between arterioles and venules, with a focus on the size of their lumens. My initial impression is that this query might be related to cardiovascular health or physiology, but I'm not entirely sure yet.\n\nUpon examining the existing reasoning and task outcomes, I notice that the query goals include comparing arterioles and venules, focusing on lumen diameter, and exploring blood vessels. The ineffective term \"larger\" is noted, which suggests that the user may be seeking more precise information on the size differences between these vessels.\n\nThe breadth expansion introduces terms like capillaries, vasodilation, and vasoconstriction, which seem relevant to the broader context of blood vessels and circulation. However, I also notice that the depth chain delves deeper into specific aspects of microcirculation, endothelial cells, and vascular permeability. This tells me that the user may be interested in the finer details of how blood vessels function and interact with their surroundings.\n\nAs I transition to a more structured approach, I decide to apply the expansion technique to discover new, relevant documents across various domains. My goal is to create an augmented query that is novel, diverse, and free from overlapping original terms.\n\nI start by identifying the primary objectives and gaps in the original query, which leads me to focus on targeted expansions that introduce new dimensions to the query. I apply synonym replacement, conceptual expansion, and contextual expansion to generate a list of candidate terms. From the breadth expansion, I select capillaries as a distant but important topic and delve deeper into related terms like endothelial cells, pericytes, and basement membrane.\n\nAs I apply the technique systematically, I also allow for natural thought patterns to emerge. I consider the relationships between the terms, making connections between capillaries and vascular permeability, and noticing how these concepts relate to the original query. I also take brief tangents, exploring the role of interstitial fluid and tissue perfusion in the context of microcirculation.\n\nThrough this process, insights begin to emerge from both the structured technique and my intuition. I realize that applying the depth expansion to capillaries leads me to discover relevant terms like endothelial cells and pericytes, which are crucial for understanding the differences between arterioles and venules. My instinct also suggests that including terms like vascular permeability and interstitial fluid will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the circulatory system.\n\nAs I synthesize the results, I believe that the augmented query should include terms from the depth expansion, such as capillaries, endothelial cells, pericytes, basement membrane, vascular permeability, interstitial fluid, and tissue perfusion. I also include the original query terms, comparing arterioles and venules, and focusing on lumen diameter. The final augmented query is: capillaries endothelial cells pericytes basement membrane vascular permeability interstitial fluid tissue perfusion compare arterioles venules lumen diameter.\n\nThis process has allowed me to generate a realistic thought process that captures how a search expert expands a query, balancing structured technique with natural cognitive patterns. By combining systematic application of the expansion technique with intuitive connections and insights, I have created an augmented query that is novel, diverse, and relevant to the original query.",
