  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n... Women born to older mothers and twins were also at some increased risk, but the results were heterogeneous across studies and publication years. Birth order, prematurity, and maternal smoking were unrelated to breast cancer risk. CONCLUSION Our findings provide some support for the hypothesis that in utero exposures reflective of higher endogenous hormone levels could affect risk for development of breast cancer in adulthood.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: OBJECTIVE To assess the effect of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) levels on pregnancy outcomes and birth variables. DESIGN Systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES Medline (1966 to August 2012), PubMed (2008 to August 2012), Embase (1980 to August 2012), CINAHL (1981 to August 2012), the Cochrane database of systematic reviews, and the Cochrane database of registered clinical trials. STUDY SELECTION Studies reporting on the association between serum 25-OHD levels during pregnancy and the outcomes of interest (pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, bacterial vaginosis, caesarean section, small for gestational age infants, birth weight, birth length, and head circumference). DATA EXTRACTION Two authors independently extracted data from original research articles, including key indicators of study quality. We pooled the most adjusted odds ratios and weighted mean differences. Associations were tested in subgroups representing different patient characteristics and study quality. RESULTS 3357 studies were identified and reviewed for eligibility. 31 eligible studies were included in the final analysis. ...\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n... MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Incidence of invasive breast cancer. RESULTS Of 314,019 women in the cohort, 2216 (0.7%) developed breast cancer during the follow-up through 2001, of whom 2100 (95%) were diagnosed before age 50 years. Compared with women who had placentas weighing less than 500 g in 2 consecutive pregnancies, the risk of breast cancer was increased among women whose placentas weighed between 500 and 699 g in their first pregnancy and at least 700 g in their second pregnancy (or vice versa) (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.82; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07-3.08), and the corresponding risk was doubled among women whose placentas weighed at least 700 g in both pregnancies (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.05; 95% CI, 1.15-3.64). A high birth weight (> or =4000 g) in 2 successive births was associated with an increased risk of breast cancer before but not after adjusting for placental weight and other covariates (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.76-1.59). CONCLUSIONS Placental weight is positively associated with maternal risk of breast cancer. These results further support the hypothesis that pregnancy hormones are important modifiers of subsequent maternal breast cancer risk.\n",
  "thought_process": "As I begin to expand the query \"Vitamin D deficiency is unrelated to birth weight,\" my initial impression is that this statement seems counterintuitive. I think of vitamin D as an essential nutrient, especially during pregnancy, and its deficiency potentially impacting various aspects of fetal development, including birth weight. However, the user's query explicitly states they are looking for information on the lack of a relationship between vitamin D deficiency and birth weight. This makes me consider the possibility that the user is looking for evidence to support a specific hypothesis or is seeking to understand the nuances of current research on this topic.\n\nAnalyzing the results from the original query, I notice that the top documents discuss various factors influencing birth weight and pregnancy outcomes but do not directly address the relationship between vitamin D deficiency and birth weight. This indicates a gap in the information provided by the initial search, suggesting that the query needs to be expanded to capture more relevant results. The text snippets from the initial results, such as discussions on placental weight and its association with maternal risk of breast cancer, hint at the complexity of factors influencing pregnancy outcomes but do not directly address vitamin D's role.\n\nTo systematically approach this query expansion, I decide to use the \"Query Expansion via User Intent and Journey Mapping\" technique. This involves creating user personas with different expertise levels and goals, analyzing their search vocabulary, mapping their information journey, and identifying contextual scenarios where this information is needed.\n\nI start by creating four distinct user personas: a novice parent, a pregnant woman, a nutritionist, and a medical researcher. Each persona has different goals, motivations, and prior knowledge about vitamin D and its effects on pregnancy. For example, a novice parent might start with a simple query like \"Does vitamin D affect baby's birth weight?\" while a medical researcher might use more specific terms like \"vitamin D supplementation and birth weight outcomes.\"\n\nNext, I analyze the search vocabulary for each persona, considering their initial search terms, follow-up searches, and how their vocabulary might change as they gain more knowledge on the topic. This step reveals a range of terms from basic to advanced, including \"vitamin D and low birth weight,\" \"impact of maternal vitamin D levels on infant birth size,\" and \"biochemical pathways of vitamin D influencing fetal growth.\"\n\nMapping the information journey for these personas involves identifying their entry-point questions, intermediate learning milestones, and advanced concept explorations. This journey mapping shows that users progress from general questions about vitamin D's importance during pregnancy to more specific inquiries about its impact on birth weight and fetal development.\n\nConsidering contextual scenarios where this information is crucial, such as planning a pregnancy, pregnancy health consultations, addressing nutritional concerns, or conducting academic research, helps to further refine the search terms. These scenarios highlight the need for information on vitamin D deficiency, birth weight, pregnancy, infant health, fetal growth, prenatal care, nutritional intervention, clinical trials, and the mechanisms of action of vitamin D.\n\nThrough this structured approach, balanced with natural thought patterns and considerations of user intent, I arrive at an expanded query that reflects the diverse needs and search behaviors of different users. The final augmented query includes terms like \"relationship between vitamin D deficiency and birth weight,\" \"impact of maternal vitamin D levels on infant birth size,\" and \"vitamin D supplementation and birth weight outcomes.\" These terms are designed to capture the essence of what users are seeking, whether they are looking for basic information or advanced research findings.\n\nBy synthesizing the insights from both the structured technique and natural cognitive patterns, I believe the expanded query effectively addresses the user's original question while accommodating the varied information needs of different personas throughout their journey from awareness to expertise.",
