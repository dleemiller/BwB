Systolic blood pressure was 7.44 mmHg (95% CI 5.39-9.49, p = 1.1 x 10(-12)) greater among *1*1 than among *2*2 homozygotes, and 4.24 mmHg (95% CI 2.18-6.31, p = 0.00005) greater among heterozygotes than among *2*2 homozygotes. CONCLUSIONS These findings support the hypothesis that alcohol intake has a marked effect on blood pressure and the risk of hypertension.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: OBJECTIVE To quantify the effects of quantity and frequency of alcohol consumption on risk of acute myocardial infarction and coronary death. DESIGN Case-control study. SETTING Lower Hunter region of New South Wales, Australia, 1983-94. SUBJECTS Men and women aged 35-69 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Acute myocardial infarction or coronary death. RESULTS Alcohol consumption patterns were compared between 11,511 cases of acute myocardial infarction or coronary death and 6077 controls randomly selected from the same study population. After adjusting for the effects of age, smoking, and medical history, men and women who consumed one or two drinks of alcohol on five or six days a week had a reduction in risk of a major coronary event compared with men and women who were non-drinkers (odds ratios: men 0.31 (95% confidence interval 0.22 to 0.45); women 0.33 (0.18 to 0.59)). A similar reduction in risk was found after excluding non-drinkers who were formerly moderate to heavy drinkers. An acute protective effect of alcohol consumption was also found for regular drinkers who consumed one or two drinks in the 24 hours preceding the onset of symptoms (odds ratios: men 0.74 (0.51 to 1.09); women 0.43 (0.20 to 0.95)). CONCLUSIONS Frequency and quantity of alcohol consumption are important in assessing the risk of a major coronary event. Risk is lowest among men who report one to four drinks daily on five or six days a week and among women who report one or two drinks daily on five or six days a week.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: PURPOSE Mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes confer greater risk of developing breast cancer. We determined whether tumor pathologic features and clinical features differ in patients with and without BRCA mutations. PATIENTS AND METHODS Tumor pathologic features and clinical characteristics were examined in 491 women with breast cancer who underwent genetic testing for BRCA mutations between 1997 and 2006. A retrospective review of medical records was conducted to determine clinical characteristics including ethnicity, age and clinical stage at diagnosis, age at parity, number of full-term pregnancies, use of oral contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy, and BRCA mutation status. Tumor pathology was reviewed to determine histologic type, tumor grade, and estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER-2/neu status. RESULTS Of the 491 patients with identified breast cancers, 391 patients were BRCA negative, and 86 patients were BRCA positive. Triple-negative breast cancer (ie, those with negative estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER-2/neu status) was diagnosed in 57.1% of the BRCA1-positive patients, 23.3% of the BRCA2-positive patients, and 13.8% of the BRCA-negative patients. BRCA1 mutation carriers had higher nuclear grade tumors than the other two groups (P < .001). ...\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"Carriers of the alcohol aldehyde dehydrogenase deficiency mutation drink less than non-carriers,\" this makes me think of the potential physiological and genetic factors that influence alcohol consumption habits. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the relationship between this specific mutation and drinking behavior, it seems there's a lack of specificity regarding the type of alcohol, the quantity consumed, or demographic factors such as age or ethnicity.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the terms \"drink\" and \"less\" are quite broad and might not effectively capture the nuances of the relationship between alcohol consumption and the ALDH2*1 gene variant. The initial results provide some insights into how alcohol intake can affect blood pressure and the risk of hypertension, as well as the effects of quantity and frequency of alcohol consumption on the risk of acute myocardial infarction and coronary death. However, these snippets don't directly address the genetic aspect of alcohol metabolism and its impact on consumption patterns.\n\nTo approach this query expansion, I'll use a structured technique that involves several steps: goal elucidation, ineffective term identification, breadth expansion, and depth expansion. This technique should help me systematically discover new, relevant terms that can enhance the original query without overlapping with its original terms.\n\nStarting with goal elucidation, the primary objective seems to be understanding how carriers of the alcohol aldehyde dehydrogenase deficiency mutation differ in their alcohol consumption habits compared to non-carriers. There's a gap in understanding the specific genetic, physiological, and possibly environmental factors that contribute to these differences.\n\nIdentifying ineffective terms, \"drink\" and \"less\" stand out as being too broad and non-precise. These terms should be avoided in the expanded query to ensure specificity and relevance.\n\nFor breadth expansion, I consider terms that introduce new dimensions to the query, such as \"ethanol metabolism,\" \"genetics of alcoholism,\" \"alcohol sensitivity,\" \"Asian flush,\" and \"biochemical pathways.\" These terms start to paint a picture of the complex interactions between genetics, alcohol metabolism, and individual responses to alcohol consumption.\n\nDelving deeper into one of these areas, let's consider \"ethanol metabolism\" as a key concept. This leads to a depth expansion where we explore terms like \"gene variants,\" \"ALDH2 gene,\" \"acetaldehyde toxicity,\" \"oxidative stress,\" and \"complications of alcohol metabolism.\" These terms provide a more nuanced understanding of how the ALDH2*1 gene variant affects alcohol metabolism and potentially influences drinking behavior.\n\nAs I apply this structured approach, I also allow for natural thought patterns to emerge. For instance, considering the biochemical pathways involved in ethanol metabolism reminds me of the importance of understanding the enzymatic processes that convert alcohol into acetaldehyde and then into acetate. This process, and how it's impacted by the ALDH2 deficiency, could offer insights into why carriers of this mutation might drink less.\n\nOccasionally, I reconsider my approach, wondering if there are other critical factors, such as dietary influences or lifestyle choices, that could interact with the genetic predisposition to affect alcohol consumption. However, the primary focus remains on the genetic and physiological aspects as they directly relate to the original query.\n\nThrough this process of applying the expansion technique and exploring related threads, I believe the terms that would be most effective for enhancing the query are those that capture both the genetic and physiological dimensions of alcohol metabolism and its relationship to the ALDH2 gene variant. Terms like \"genetic predisposition,\" \"acetaldehyde,\" \"oxidative stress,\" \"ethanol metabolism,\" \"ALDH2 gene variant,\" \"Asian flush,\" \"complications,\" and \"alcohol sensitivity\" seem to encompass the necessary breadth and depth to provide a comprehensive understanding of the original query's objectives.",
