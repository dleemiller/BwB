  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: How individual cells respond to mechanical forces is of considerable interest to biologists as force affects many aspects of cell behaviour. The application of force on integrins triggers cytoskeletal rearrangements and growth of the associated adhesion complex, resulting in increased cellular stiffness, also known as reinforcement. Although RhoA has been shown to play a role during reinforcement, the molecular mechanisms that regulate its activity are unknown. By combining biochemical and biophysical approaches, we identified two guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), LARG and GEF-H1, as key molecules that regulate the cellular adaptation to force. We show that stimulation of integrins with tensional force triggers activation of these two GEFs and their recruitment to adhesion complexes. Surprisingly, activation of LARG and GEF-H1 involves distinct signalling pathways. Our results reveal that LARG is activated by the Src family tyrosine kinase Fyn, whereas GEF-H1 catalytic activity is enhanced by ERK downstream of a signalling cascade that includes FAK and Ras.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: Certain bacterial adhesins appear to promote a pathogen's extracellular lifestyle rather than its entry into host cells. However, little is known about the stimuli elicited upon such pathogen host-cell interactions. Here, we report that type IV pili (Tfp)-producing Neisseria gonorrhoeae (P(+)GC) induces an immediate recruitment of caveolin-1 (Cav1) in the host cell, which subsequently prevents bacterial internalization by triggering cytoskeletal rearrangements via downstream phosphotyrosine signaling. A broad and unbiased analysis of potential interaction partners for tyrosine-phosphorylated Cav1 revealed a direct interaction with the Rho-family guanine nucleotide exchange factor Vav2. Both Vav2 and its substrate, the small GTPase RhoA, were found to play a direct role in the Cav1-mediated prevention of bacterial uptake. Our findings, which have been extended to enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, highlight how Tfp-producing bacteria avoid host cell uptake. Further, our data establish a mechanistic link between Cav1 phosphorylation and pathogen-induced cytoskeleton reorganization and advance our understanding of caveolin function.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: Steroid receptor RNA activator (SRA), the only known RNA coactivator, augments transactivation by nuclear receptors (NRs). We identified SLIRP (SRA stem-loop interacting RNA binding protein) binding to a functional substructure of SRA, STR7. SLIRP is expressed in normal and tumor tissues, contains an RNA recognition motif (RRM), represses NR transactivation in a SRA- and RRM-dependent manner, augments the effect of Tamoxifen, and modulates association of SRC-1 with SRA. SHARP, a RRM-containing corepressor, also binds STR7, augmenting repression with SLIRP. SLIRP colocalizes with SKIP (Chr14q24.3), another NR coregulator, and reduces SKIP-potentiated NR signaling. SLIRP is recruited to endogenous promoters (pS2 and metallothionein), the latter in a SRA-dependent manner, while NCoR promoter recruitment is dependent on SLIRP. The majority of the endogenous SLIRP resides in the mitochondria. Our data demonstrate that SLIRP modulates NR transactivation, suggest it may regulate mitochondrial function, and provide mechanistic insight into interactions between SRA, SLIRP, SRC-1, and NCoR.\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"Leukemia associated Rho guanine nucleotide-exchange factor represses RhoA in response to SRC activation,\" this makes me think of the complex interactions between various proteins and signaling pathways in the context of leukemia. The user might actually be trying to understand how a specific Rho GEF is involved in leukemia progression, particularly in relation to SRC activation and its downstream effects. However, the initial results seem to touch on broader topics related to Rho GTPases, force sensing, and cytoskeletal dynamics, which, while relevant, don't fully capture the specific focus on leukemia-associated proteins and signaling pathways.\n\nAnalyzing the results, I notice that they lack depth in discussing leukemia-specific Rho guanine nucleotide-exchange factors and the mechanisms by which SRC activation regulates this GEF. The task outcomes highlight the need to identify leukemia-specific Rho GEFs, investigate the mechanisms of SRC activation, and explore the connection between this GEF and leukemia progression. The ineffective terms listed, such as \"Rho GTPases,\" \"force sensing,\" and \"cytoskeletal dynamics,\" suggest that we need to move beyond these general concepts to more specific and diverse terms related to leukemia and cancer signaling pathways.\n\nTransitioning to a structured approach, I decide to apply the expansion technique outlined, which involves being specific and diverse, applying varied augmentation techniques, and focusing on targeted expansions that introduce new dimensions to the query. This technique should help because it guides us to systematically explore the query's objectives and gaps, identify ineffective terms, expand the breadth of related concepts, and then delve deeper into specific areas of interest.\n\nFollowing the expansion technique, I first elucidate the query's goals and gaps, recognizing the need for more specific information on leukemia-associated Rho GEFs and their regulation by SRC activation. I identify broad terms that should be avoided, such as those related to general Rho GTPase functions. Next, I engage in breadth expansion by considering terms related to leukemia-associated proteins, cancer signaling pathways, oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. This step is crucial for casting a wider net and capturing relevant concepts that might not be immediately apparent from the original query.\n\nFor depth expansion, I choose to focus on the RAS-MAPK pathway, given its importance in cancer development and progression. I apply synonym replacement, conceptual expansion, and contextual expansion to explore this pathway further, considering terms like \"SRC family kinases,\" \"phosphorylation,\" \"downstream targets,\" and \"NF-\u03baB signaling.\" This systematic approach allows me to uncover more nuanced relationships between these concepts and the original query.\n\nAs I apply the technique, I also allow for natural thought patterns to emerge, including occasional false starts or reconsiderations. For instance, I initially consider exploring the role of Rho GEFs in cytoskeletal dynamics but then realize that this might not be directly relevant to the leukemia context. I also make intuitive connections, such as recognizing that the RAS-MAPK pathway's involvement in cell proliferation and survival could be critical in understanding how leukemia-associated Rho GEFs contribute to cancer progression.\n\nThrough this process, insights begin to emerge from both the structured approach and my natural thought patterns. Applying the expansion technique leads me to discover specific terms related to the RAS-MAPK pathway and its role in cancer, which complements my intuitive sense that these pathways are crucial in leukemia. I realize that the augmented query should include terms that reflect both the explicit and implicit aspects of the user's query, capturing the complexity of leukemia-associated Rho GEFs and their regulation by SRC activation.\n\nSynthesizing my findings, I believe that the terms \"leukemia associated rho gef,\" \"src phosphorylation,\" \"ras mapk,\" and \"nf \u03bab\" would be most effective for a BM25 index. These terms capture the specific focus on leukemia-associated proteins, the regulatory role of SRC activation, and the involvement of key signaling pathways like RAS-MAPK and NF-\u03baB. This approach ensures that the final terms emerge logically from both the technique and my natural insights, providing a comprehensive and targeted query expansion.",
