  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: Background The catalytically active 66-kDa subunit of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (RT) consists of DNA polymerase, connection, and ribonuclease H (RNase H) domains. Almost all known RT inhibitor resistance mutations identified to date map to the polymerase domain of the enzyme. However, the connection and RNase H domains are not routinely analysed in clinical samples and none of the genotyping assays available for patient management sequence the entire RT coding region. The British Columbia Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS (the Centre) genotypes clinical isolates up to codon 400 in RT, and our retrospective statistical analyses of the Centre\u2019s database have identified an N348I mutation in the RT connection domain in treatment-experienced individuals. ...\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: Adult T-cell leukaemia lymphoma (ATLL) is an aggressive disease caused by the human T-lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV-I) with a short survival. Responses to interferon alpha (IFN-alpha) and zidovudine (AZT) have been documented but not with long-term follow-up. We treated 15 ATLL patients with IFN and AZT. Eleven patients had acute ATLL, two had lymphoma and two smouldering ATLL, with progression. The main features were: organomegaly (14), skin lesions (10), high white blood cell (WBC) count (11) and hypercalcaemia (9). Eleven patients had previously received chemotherapy and one had received an autograft. At the time of the study, seven patients had progressive disease and eight were in partial or complete clinical remission. Responses (PR) lasting 2+ to 44+ months were seen in 67%; 26% did not respond (NR) and one patient was not evaluable. Hypercalcaemia predicted a poor outcome but differences were not significant. Eight of the 15 patients have died 3-41 months from diagnosis. Median survival for the 15 patients was 18 months. Survival of the NR ranged from 4 to 20 months; six PR patients are alive 8-82 months from diagnosis. The differences in survival between NR (median: 6 months) and PR (55% of patients alive at 4 years) were statistically significant (P = 0.002). In conclusion, IFN and AZT improves the outcome of ATLL patients and helps maintain responses.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: Activating mutations in genes encoding G protein \u03b1 (G\u03b1) subunits occur in 4-5% of all human cancers, but oncogenic alterations in G\u03b2 subunits have not been defined. Here we demonstrate that recurrent mutations in the G\u03b2 proteins GNB1 and GNB2 confer cytokine-independent growth and activate canonical G protein signaling. Multiple mutations in GNB1 affect the protein interface that binds G\u03b1 subunits as well as downstream effectors and disrupt G\u03b1 interactions with the G\u03b2\u03b3 dimer. Different mutations in G\u03b2 proteins clustered partly on the basis of lineage; for example, all 11 GNB1 K57 mutations were in myeloid neoplasms, and seven of eight GNB1 I80 mutations were in B cell neoplasms. Expression of patient-derived GNB1 variants in Cdkn2a-deficient mouse bone marrow followed by transplantation resulted in either myeloid or B cell malignancies. In vivo treatment with the dual PI3K-mTOR inhibitor BEZ235 suppressed GNB1-induced signaling and markedly increased survival. In several human tumors, mutations in the gene encoding GNB1 co-occurred with oncogenic kinase alterations, including the BCR-ABL fusion protein, the V617F substitution in JAK2 and the V600K substitution in BRAF. Coexpression of patient-derived GNB1 variants with these mutant kinases resulted in inhibitor resistance in each context. Thus, GNB1 and GNB2 alterations confer transformed and resistance phenotypes across a range of human tumors and may be targetable with inhibitors of G protein signaling.\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query about N348I mutations causing resistance to zidovudine (AZT), this makes me think of the complex mechanisms behind drug resistance in HIV treatment. The user might actually be trying to understand the molecular basis of this resistance, which could involve various factors including the specific effects of the N348I mutation on the HIV reverse transcriptase enzyme.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, it's clear that the initial search terms might be too broad or not precise enough, as they don't yield a deep understanding of the molecular mechanisms or the specific implications of the N348I mutation. The existing reasoning provides a good starting point, focusing on the relationship between the mutation and resistance to AZT, but we need to expand this query to capture more relevant information.\n\nTo approach this systematically, I'll use the expansion technique provided, which involves identifying ineffective terms, performing breadth expansion, and then applying depth expansion to uncover more targeted and relevant search terms. This technique should help in discovering new dimensions to the query that are novel and free from overlapping the original terms.\n\nStarting with goal elucidation and gaps, the primary objective is to understand the molecular basis of AZT resistance and the specific effects of the N348I mutation. A gap in the current query is its lack of specificity regarding the molecular mechanisms and potential therapeutic interventions.\n\nThe ineffective terms identified include \"N348I mutations\" and \"zidovudine (AZT)\" because, while they are central to the query, they are too broad and don't allow for a nuanced exploration of the topic.\n\nFor breadth expansion, terms like \"viral resistance mechanisms,\" \"HIV reverse transcriptase,\" \"antiretroviral drug efficacy,\" \"drug target interactions,\" \"pharmacogenomics,\" \"mutation analysis,\" and \"clinical trials\" can introduce new dimensions to the query. These terms capture a wider range of concepts related to drug resistance and HIV treatment, potentially leading to more comprehensive search results.\n\nSelecting one of these topics for depth expansion, let's focus on \"HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitors\" as it directly relates to the mechanism of action of zidovudine (AZT) and the impact of the N348I mutation. Depth expansion involves delving deeper into this topic to find more specific and relevant terms. This could include \"nucleoside analogs,\" \"proviral DNA replication,\" \"genetic diversity of HIV,\" and \"treatment strategies for resistant HIV.\" These terms not only offer a deeper understanding of the mechanisms involved but also touch upon the therapeutic and clinical aspects of managing drug resistance.\n\nThroughout this process, it's essential to balance the structured approach with natural thought patterns, allowing for reconsiderations, intuitive leaps, and connections that might not be immediately apparent through the technique alone. For instance, recognizing the importance of \"nucleoside analogs\" in the context of HIV treatment might lead to an exploration of similar compounds or strategies that could be effective against resistant strains.\n\nAs we apply the technique and explore related threads, insights begin to emerge. The application of the expansion technique leads to the discovery of terms like \"HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitors\" and \"nucleoside analogs,\" which are directly relevant to understanding the resistance mechanisms and potential therapeutic interventions. Additionally, considering the genetic diversity of HIV and the impact of mutations on treatment outcomes provides a more comprehensive view of the challenges and opportunities in this area.\n\nSynthesizing these insights, the terms that would be most effective for a BM25 index, considering both the explicit and implicit aspects of the user's query, are indeed \"HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitors,\" \"nucleoside analogs,\" \"proviral DNA replication,\" and \"genetic diversity.\" These terms capture the essence of the molecular mechanisms, therapeutic targets, and clinical considerations relevant to the N348I mutation and AZT resistance.\n\nThrough this process of applying the expansion technique and exploring related threads, I believe the final augmented query effectively balances structured approach and natural intuition, leading to a set of terms that are both targeted and relevant to the original query. The resulting terms should yield a more comprehensive set of search results, providing deeper insights into the molecular basis of AZT resistance, the specific effects of the N348I mutation, and potential therapeutic interventions.",
