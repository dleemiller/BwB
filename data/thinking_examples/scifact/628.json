In the new host, the outcome may vary from inapparent infection to highly pathogenic, the former being reported for African monkeys, whereas the latter being observed in macaques and humans. The high diversity of SIVs was generated by a high mutation rate due to a low fidelity of the reverse-transcriptase and active viral and host cell turnover, host-dependent evolution and recombination. Cross-species transmission is not rare, however preferential host switching may drive the majority of cross-species transmissions. Numerous SIVs tested so far are able to grow in vitro on human PBMC, therefore it has been postulated that SIV represents a threat for infection of humans in Central Africa and that AIDS is a zoonosis. However, although the simian origin of the two HIV types is broadly acknowledged, there are no data that AIDS is acquired like a zoonosis. SIV may undergo adaptation in the new human host in order to emerge in the general population. The study of SIV in their natural hosts should provide important clues to the real threat to human populations and also elucidate the mechanisms associated with a long-term persistent viral infection without clinical consequences for the host.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n... Vaginal HPV infection was also more common in HIV-positive than in HIV-negative women (50.8% vs. 22.6%, p < 0.0001) as was infection with high-risk oncogenic HPV types (48.4% vs. 17.3%, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS Classical STIs were infrequent in this clinic-based population of African-Caribbean women in Toronto. However, HSV-2 prevalence was higher than that reported in previous studies in the general Canadian population and was strongly associated with HIV infection, as was infection with hepatitis B and HPV.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: Monogenic deficiency diseases provide unique opportunities to define the contributions of individual molecules to human physiology and to identify pathologies arising from their dysfunction. Here we describe a deficiency disease in two human siblings that presented with severe bleeding, frequent infections and osteopetrosis at an early age. These symptoms are consistent with but more severe than those reported for people with leukocyte adhesion deficiency III (LAD-III). Mechanistically, these symptoms arose from an inability to activate the integrins expressed on hematopoietic cells, including platelets and leukocytes. Immortalized lymphocyte cell lines isolated from the two individuals showed integrin activation defects. Several proteins previously implicated in integrin activation, including Ras-associated protein-1 (RAP1) and calcium and diacylglycerol-regulated guanine nucleotide exchange factor-1 (CALDAG-GEF1), were present and functional in these cell lines. The genetic basis for this disease was traced to a point mutation in the coding region of the KINDLIN3 (official gene symbol FERMT3) gene. When wild-type KINDLIN-3 was expressed in the immortalized lymphocytes, their integrins became responsive to activation signals.These results identify a genetic disease that severely compromises the health of the affected individuals and establish an essential role of KINDLIN-3 in integrin activation in humans. Furthermore, allogeneic bone marrow transplantation was shown to alleviate the symptoms of the disease.\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"Infection of human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 is most frequent in individuals of African origin,\" this makes me think of how certain viruses tend to have higher prevalence rates in specific populations due to various factors such as genetics, lifestyle, or environmental conditions. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the epidemiology of HTLV-1 specifically in African populations, the initial results seem to touch on related but distinct topics, such as SIV transmission and the prevalence of other infections like HPV and HIV in similar demographics. Hmm, not sure yet how to bridge the gap between these results and the specific query about HTLV-1.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that while they provide valuable context on retroviral transmission and the prevalence of other infections in African or African-origin populations, they lack specific data on HTLV-1 infection rates. This suggests that the search terms might not be precise enough to capture the desired information, indicating a need for query expansion.\n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here, but let me approach this using the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal technique, which involves constructing a conceptual graph around the core concepts and entities in the query and then traversing this graph to find semantically relevant terms for expansion. This should help because it systematically identifies related concepts and terms that might not be immediately apparent but are crucial for a comprehensive search.\n\nFollowing the Query Expansion technique, I first identify the core concepts: HTLV-1, infection, African origin, and epidemiology. The search intent is informational, aiming to understand the prevalence and distribution of HTLV-1 in African populations. There's an implicit assumption that geographical and ethnic factors play a role in the virus's spread.\n\nConstructing the conceptual graph, I start with core nodes like \"HTLV-1\" and \"African origin.\" First-order connections include terms like \"infection rates,\" \"epidemiology,\" and \"population studies.\" Second-order connections might involve related viruses, transmission methods, and societal or environmental factors influencing the virus's spread in African communities.\n\nFor expansion path selection, I consider synonymous terms (e.g., \"HTLV-1 prevalence\" instead of \"infection rates\"), hierarchical terms (broader terms like \"retroviral infections\" or narrower terms like \"HTLV-1 subtypes\"), compositional terms (components of the virus or attributes of the infection), contextual terms (settings where the infection is common, like \"rural Africa\"), and domain-specific terminology (terms used in virology or epidemiology, such as \"seroprevalence\" or \"endemic areas\").\n\nApplying the technique's steps, I extract high-value terms like \"HTLV-1 epidemiology,\" \"African HTLV-1 prevalence,\" \"risk factors for HTLV-1 infection,\" and \"geographical distribution of HTLV-1.\" These terms seem relevant, distinctive, specific, and searchable, making them suitable for expanding the query.\n\nI just had a realization that connects to what we were exploring earlier - the importance of understanding not just the prevalence but also the risk factors and geographical distribution of HTLV-1 in African populations. This could significantly impact public health strategies and interventions.\n\nThrough this process of applying the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal technique and exploring related threads, I believe the terms \"HTLV-1 prevalence in Africa,\" \"HTLV-1 epidemiology,\" \"African origin,\" and \"risk factors for HTLV-1 infection\" would be most effective for a comprehensive search. They capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, balancing structured technique with natural cognitive patterns to enhance the query's precision and recall.",
