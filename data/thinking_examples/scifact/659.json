  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: Over the past two decades there have been significant achievements in the control of a handful of important human tropical infections [1]. These achievements include the substantive reductions in the prevalence and incidence of the so-called neglected diseases such as lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, guinea worm, leprosy, and trachoma (Box 1) [2]. Each of these neglected diseases is a poverty-promoting and often stigmatizing condition occurring primarily in rural areas of low-income countries (Box 2) [3]. They are ancient afflictions, described in the Bible and other ancient texts, which have burdened humanity for millennia [3]. But now, as a result of aggressive regional vertical interventions, there is a possibility that some neglected tropical infections could be eventually controlled to the point of elimination in some areas of endemicity [2\u20138]. In the case of guinea worm infection, disease eradication might also soon be possible [9]. Box 2. Common Features of the Neglected Tropical Diseases          Ancient afflictions that have burdened humanity for centuries      Poverty-promoting conditions      Associated with stigma      Rural areas of low-income countries and fragile states      No commercial markets for products that target these diseases      Interventions, when applied, have a history of success\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: Immune cells continuously recirculate through lymph vessels en route from peripheral tissues to the blood. Leuyte trafficking into and within lymph vessels is mediated by an interply with lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs). However, lymphatic vessels are much more than mere conduits for fluid and immune cell transport. Data accumulating during past several years indicate that LECs support T cell survival, induce tolerance to self-antigens, inhibit exaggerated T cell proliferation during immune response and maintain T cell memory. Reciprocally, leukocytes impact LEC biology: lymphatic vessel permeability depends on DCs while lymphocytes regulate LEC proliferation during inflammation. Altogether, these novel results provide important insights on intimate connections between LECs and leukocytes that contribute to the understanding of immune responses.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n... Lastly, in vitro studies demonstrated a similar pattern of serial gene expression among LKB1, LGR5 and PRKAA1 after irradiation. Our results suggest that LKB1 and LGR5 expression may be implicated in resistance to CRT, therefore contributing to tumor relapse in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer treated with preoperative CRT.\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"Ivermectin is used to treat lymphatic filariasis,\" my initial impression is that this query is quite specific, focusing on the application of Ivermectin for a particular disease. The user is likely seeking detailed information on how Ivermectin works against lymphatic filariasis, its efficacy, and possibly its side effects. However, the existing results seem to be too broad, discussing general aspects of the lymphatic system without delving into the specifics of Ivermectin's use for this condition. This makes me think that we need to refine the query to capture more targeted information.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, it becomes apparent that terms like \"lymphatic system\" are too broad and do not effectively capture the specific use of Ivermectin for lymphatic filariasis. We need to identify terms that are more precise and directly related to the treatment of lymphatic filariasis with Ivermectin. The task outcomes provide a good starting point, highlighting the need to explore mechanisms of action, clinical trials, efficacy, and safety considerations.\n\nTo approach this systematically, I will apply the expansion technique, which involves being specific and diverse, and utilizing various augmentation techniques such as synonym replacement, conceptual expansion, and domain-specific terminology. The goal is to discover new, relevant documents that do not overlap with the original terms.\n\nStarting with goal elucidation and gaps, the primary objective is to understand how Ivermectin treats lymphatic filariasis, which involves exploring its mechanisms of action, efficacy in clinical trials, and safety profile. The main gap in the current query is its inability to fetch specific information related to these aspects.\n\nMoving on to ineffective term identification, terms like \"lymphatic system\" are too broad and should be avoided. Instead, we should focus on terms directly related to Ivermectin and lymphatic filariasis.\n\nFor breadth expansion, we can consider terms like \"antiparasitic drugs,\" \"neglected tropical diseases,\" \"parasite control,\" \"drug efficacy,\" and \"clinical trials.\" These terms introduce new dimensions to the query, making it more diverse and specific.\n\nDepth expansion involves choosing a distant but important topic and delving deeper into related terms. Let's choose \"onchocerciasis\" (river blindness), another disease treated by Ivermectin, and expand from there. Terms like \"microfilariae,\" \"macrofilariae,\" \"immunomodulation,\" and \"anti-inflammatory effects\" become relevant, providing a deeper understanding of how Ivermectin works against parasites.\n\nAs I apply the expansion technique, I notice that terms like \"antiparasitic drugs,\" \"onchocerciasis,\" \"microfilariae,\" \"macrofilariae,\" \"immunomodulation,\" \"clinical trials,\" and \"efficacy\" are emerging as key components of the augmented query. These terms are specific, diverse, and directly relevant to the treatment of lymphatic filariasis with Ivermectin. The augmented query starts to take shape, focusing on the mechanisms of action, clinical efficacy, and safety considerations of Ivermectin for lymphatic filariasis.\n\nHowever, I also consider the potential for false starts or reconsiderations. For instance, initially, I might have considered including terms related to the general lymphatic system, but upon further reflection, these are deemed too broad and not specific enough for our query. This process of reconsideration is crucial, as it ensures that our final query is as targeted and effective as possible.\n\nAdditionally, intuitive connections and tangents play a role in this process. For example, recognizing the connection between onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis, both being diseases targeted by Ivermectin, helps in identifying relevant terms for the query. This intuitive leap complements the systematic approach, enriching the query with terms that might not have been considered through the structured technique alone.\n\nStepping back to reassess, it's clear that the combination of systematic expansion and natural cognitive patterns has led to a robust and targeted augmented query. This query balances specificity with diversity, ensuring that the search results will be relevant and non-overlapping with the original query.\n\nThrough this process of applying the expansion technique and exploring related threads, I believe the terms \"antiparasitic drugs,\" \"onchocerciasis,\" \"microfilariae,\" \"macrofilariae,\" \"immunomodulation,\" \"clinical trials,\" \"efficacy,\" and \"river blindness\" would be most effective for a BM25 index. They capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, providing a comprehensive view of Ivermectin's use in treating lymphatic filariasis.",
