  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: Inflammation induced by recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns markedly affects subsequent adaptive responses. We asked whether the adaptive immune system can also affect the character and magnitude of innate inflammatory responses. We found that the response of memory, but not naive, CD4+ T cells enhances production of multiple innate inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (IICs) in the lung and that, during influenza infection, this leads to early control of virus. Memory CD4+ T cell\u2013induced IICs and viral control require cognate antigen recognition and are optimal when memory cells are either T helper type 1 (TH1) or TH17 polarized but are independent of interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) production and do not require activation of conserved pathogen recognition pathways. This represents a previously undescribed mechanism by which memory CD4+ T cells induce an early innate response that enhances immune protection against pathogens.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: Herpesviruses encode membrane-associated G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in their viral genomes that are structurally similar to chemokine receptors. These GPCRs hijack GPCR-mediated cellular signalling networks of the host for survival, replication and pathogenesis. In particular the herpesvirus-encoded chemokine receptors ORF74, BILF1 and US28, which are present at inflammatory sites and tumour cells, provide important virus-specific targets for directed therapies. Given the high druggability of GPCRs in general, these viral GPCRs can be considered promising antiviral drug targets.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n... Because inflammation plays an important role in the onset and progression of a wide range of diseases, this model may have broad implications for understanding the role of stress in health.\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"Enhanced early production of inflammatory chemokines improves viral control in the lung,\" this makes me think of the intricate mechanisms by which the body fights off viral infections, particularly in the lungs. The user seems to be focusing on a very specific aspect of immune response\u2014how the early production of inflammatory chemokines can enhance viral control. However, the existing results seem to lack a direct exploration of this precise mechanism, often delving into broader aspects of immune responses or connections to cancer, which, while related, do not directly address the query's focus.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that there's a significant gap in understanding the specific role of enhanced early chemokine production in viral control within the lungs. The terms that have been used so far, such as \"broad\" and \"immune responses,\" are too general and do not effectively capture the nuanced mechanism the user is interested in. This indicates a need to identify more specific and targeted terms that can help uncover the desired information.\n\nTo approach this systematically, I'll use the expansion technique provided, which involves being specific and diverse, applying varied augmentation techniques such as synonym replacement, conceptual expansion, contextual expansion, and incorporating domain-specific terminology. \n\nStarting with goal elucidation and gaps, the primary objectives are to identify mechanisms for enhanced early chemokine production, explore the role of chemokines in early viral lung infection, and understand the impact of chemokines on viral clearance in the lungs. The gaps in current knowledge include a lack of direct exploration of these mechanisms and an overemphasis on broader immune responses.\n\nFor ineffective term identification, terms like \"broad\" and \"immune responses\" are too general and should be avoided as they do not contribute to a precise understanding of the query's focus.\n\nIn breadth expansion, candidate terms that introduce new dimensions to the query are considered. These include chemokine receptors, cytokine storm, innate immunity, antiviral response, lung epithelial cells, pathogen sensing, and inflammation regulation. These terms start to build a more comprehensive picture of the factors at play in early viral lung infection and the role of chemokines.\n\nFor depth expansion, focusing on one of these distant but important topics\u2014such as chemokine receptors\u2014and then going deeper into related terms such as TLR signaling, pattern recognition receptors, signaling pathways, NF-\u03baB activation, and IFN production, can provide a richer understanding of the mechanisms involved. \n\nApplying the technique systematically, I consider how each step reveals new insights. For instance, examining chemokine receptors leads to an understanding of their role in viral infection, which then connects to TLR signaling and the broader context of innate immunity. This process of systematically applying the technique while allowing for natural cognitive elements like reconsiderations and intuitive connections is crucial. It's akin to following a map but also being open to discovering new paths that might lead to unexpected but valuable insights.\n\nAs I synthesize the information, it becomes clear that the augmented query should include terms from the depth expansion, such as chemokine receptors, TLR signaling, pattern recognition receptors, NF-\u03baB activation, and IFN production, as these terms directly address the mechanisms of enhanced early chemokine production and its impact on viral control in the lungs. Ensuring these terms are unique, diverse, and devoid of logical operators or ineffective words is key to creating a high-quality search query.\n\nThrough this process of applying the expansion technique and exploring related threads, I believe the terms identified for the augmented query effectively capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking. These terms are not just a collection of related words but are informed by a systematic approach that balances structure with natural cognitive patterns, leading to a more nuanced and targeted search query.",
