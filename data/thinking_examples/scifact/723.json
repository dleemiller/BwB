  "reasoning": "The query focuses on understanding the role of Ly49Q in neutrophil migration through its regulation of membrane raft functions. While existing results provide a good foundation, they lack specific examples and deeper insights into the signaling pathways involved. To improve the search, we need to: 1) clarify the goals of the research, 2) identify terms that might be too broad, 3) explore related concepts beyond membrane rafts, 4) delve deeper into one specific aspect of membrane raft regulation, and finally, 5) construct an augmented query incorporating these refinements.",

  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: Neutrophils rapidly undergo polarization and directional movement to infiltrate the sites of infection and inflammation. Here, we show that an inhibitory MHC I receptor, Ly49Q, was crucial for the swift polarization of and tissue infiltration by neutrophils. During the steady state, Ly49Q inhibited neutrophil adhesion by preventing focal-complex formation, likely by inhibiting Src and PI3 kinases. However, in the presence of inflammatory stimuli, Ly49Q mediated rapid neutrophil polarization and tissue infiltration in an ITIM-domain-dependent manner. These opposite functions appeared to be mediated by distinct use of effector phosphatase SHP-1 and SHP-2. Ly49Q-dependent polarization and migration were affected by Ly49Q regulation of membrane raft functions. We propose that Ly49Q is pivotal in switching neutrophils to their polarized morphology and rapid migration upon inflammation, through its spatiotemporal regulation of membrane rafts and raft-associated signaling molecules.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: Elastases of both the neutrophil and macrophage have been implicated in lung disease initiation and progression. Although it is unlikely that these proteases evolved for the purpose of injuring lung tissue, the elastin-rich connective tissue framework of the lungs appears to be particularly susceptible to the action of elastolytic proteases. Assuming that neutrophil elastase most likely plays a role in the migration of neutrophils toward a site of inflammation and degradation of proteins from invading organisms or other products of the inflammatory response, it is the role of inhibitors of this protease to protect normal tissues from its effects. In alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency we find an experiment of nature that disrupts this protease-anti-protease balance, resulting in an increased risk of destructive lung disease.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: Metastatic tumor cells that actively migrate and invade surrounding tissues rely on invadopodia to degrade extracellular matrix (ECM) barriers. Invadopodia are membrane protrusions that localize enzymes required for ECM degradation. Little is known about the formation, function, and regulation of invadopodia. Here, we show that invadopodia have two distinct aspects: (a) structural for organizing the cellular actin cytoskeleton to form membrane protrusions and (b) functional for using proteolytic enzyme(s) for ECM degradation. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) inhibition established that organization of invadopodia structure requires cortactin, whereas protease inhibitor studies identified membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) as the key invadopodial enzyme responsible for gelatin matrix degradation in the breast carcinoma cell line MDA-MB-231. The inhibition of invadopodial structure assembly by cortactin depletion resulted in a block of matrix degradation due to failure of invadopodia formation. Either protease inhibition or MT1-MMP siRNA depletion moderately decreased the formation of invadopodial structures that were identified as actin-cortactin accumulations at the ventral cell membrane adherent to matrix. The invadopodia that were able to form upon MT1-MMP inhibition or depletion retained actin-cortactin accumulations but were unable to degrade matrix. ...\n",
  "thought_process": "As I delve into the query \"Ly49Q directs the organization of neutrophil migration to inflammation sites by regulating membrane raft functions,\" my initial impression is that this query is highly specific, focusing on the role of Ly49Q in neutrophil migration and its regulation of membrane raft functions. This makes me think of how Ly49Q could be influencing the signaling pathways involved in neutrophil migration, and whether there are specific mechanisms by which it regulates membrane rafts.\n\nLooking at the initial results, I notice that the first text snippet highlights Ly49Q's role in neutrophil polarization and tissue infiltration, which seems to be mediated by its regulation of membrane raft functions. This suggests that membrane rafts might be a crucial aspect of Ly49Q's function in neutrophil migration. However, the term \"inflammation\" seems somewhat broad, and I wonder if there are more specific terms that could be used to capture the context of Ly49Q's function.\n\nThe second text snippet discusses the role of elastases in lung disease, which seems somewhat tangential to the original query. However, it does highlight the importance of proteases in neutrophil migration and the degradation of proteins during inflammation. This makes me think that proteases might be an important aspect of Ly49Q's function, and that exploring the signaling pathways involved in protease regulation could be fruitful.\n\nThe tenth text snippet discusses invadopodia and their role in metastatic tumor cell migration, which seems quite distant from the original query. However, it does highlight the importance of membrane protrusions and the organization of the actin cytoskeleton in cell migration, which could be relevant to Ly49Q's regulation of membrane rafts.\n\nAs I transition to a more structured approach, I decide to use the expansion technique to identify new terms and concepts that could be relevant to the query. The first step is to elucidate the goals of the research, which seem to be understanding Ly49Q's influence on neutrophil migration, identifying specific mechanisms of membrane raft regulation, and exploring signaling pathways involved in Ly49Q-mediated migration.\n\nNext, I identify ineffective terms, such as \"inflammation,\" which seems too broad, and \"organization,\" which is somewhat vague. I also notice that the term \"membrane rafts\" could be expanded to include more specific terms, such as \"lipid rafts\" or \"cholesterol.\"\n\nAs I apply the expansion technique, I start to see possibilities for breadth expansion, including terms like \"cell adhesion molecules,\" \"cytoskeleton,\" \"chemotaxis,\" and \"signal transduction.\" These terms seem to be related to Ly49Q's function in neutrophil migration, and exploring them could provide new insights.\n\nHowever, I also want to delve deeper into one specific aspect of membrane raft regulation, such as the role of cholesterol or sphingolipids. This could provide a more nuanced understanding of Ly49Q's function and reveal new terms and concepts that could be relevant to the query.\n\nAs I explore the depth expansion, I start to see connections between the terms and concepts. For example, the role of cholesterol in membrane raft regulation seems to be linked to the signaling pathways involved in Ly49Q-mediated migration. This makes me think that exploring the relationships between these terms could provide new insights into Ly49Q's function.\n\nThroughout this process, I've had several false starts and reconsiderations. At one point, I thought that exploring the role of proteases in neutrophil migration might be a fruitful avenue, but as I delved deeper, I realized that it was somewhat tangential to the original query. However, this tangential exploration did lead me to think about the importance of membrane protrusions and the organization of the actin cytoskeleton in cell migration, which could be relevant to Ly49Q's regulation of membrane rafts.\n\nAs I step back to reassess, I realize that the expanded query should include terms that capture the specific mechanisms of membrane raft regulation, such as \"lipid rafts,\" \"cholesterol,\" and \"sphingolipids.\" It should also include terms that reflect the signaling pathways involved in Ly49Q-mediated migration, such as \"signal transduction\" and \"chemotaxis.\"\n\nThrough this process of applying the expansion technique and exploring related threads, I believe that the following terms would be most effective for a BM25 index: Ly49Q, neutrophil migration, membrane rafts, cholesterol, sphingolipids, signal transduction, chemotaxis. These terms capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, and they provide a nuanced understanding of Ly49Q's function in neutrophil migration.",
