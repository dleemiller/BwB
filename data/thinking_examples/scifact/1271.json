Transmural LGE predicted death (hazard ratio, 5.4; 95% confidence interval, 2.1-13.7; P<0.0001) and remained independent after adjustment for N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, ejection fraction, stroke volume index, E/E', and left ventricular mass index (hazard ratio, 4.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-13.1; P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS There is a continuum of cardiac involvement in systemic AL and ATTR amyloidosis. Transmural LGE is determined reliably by PSIR and represents advanced cardiac amyloidosis. The PSIR technique provides incremental information on outcome even after adjustment for known prognostic factors.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: Background: Atherosclerosis is characterized by infiltration of inflammatory cells from circulating blood. Blood cell activation could play an important role in plaque formation. Methods: We analyzed the relationship between blood cellular markers and quantitative measures of carotid wall components in 1,546 participants from the ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) Carotid MRI Study. Carotid imaging was performed using a gadolinium contrast-enhanced MRI and cellular phenotyping by flow cytometry. Results: Monocyte Toll-like receptor (TLR)-2 is associated with larger plaques, while CD14, myeloperoxidase, and TLR-4 associate with smaller. Platelet CD40L is associated with smaller plaques and thinner caps, while P-selectin is associated with smaller core size. Conclusions: Blood cell activation is significantly associated with atherosclerotic changes of the carotid wall.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: The introduction of immune-checkpoint blockade in the cancer therapy led to a paradigm change of the management of late stage cancers. There are already multiple FDA approved checkpoint inhibitors and many other agents are undergoing phase 2 and early phase 3 clinical trials. The therapeutic indication of immune checkpoint inhibitors expanded in the last years, but still remains unclear who can benefit. MicroRNAs are small RNAs with no coding potential. By complementary pairing to the 3' untranslated region of messenger RNA, microRNAs exert posttranscriptional control of protein expression. A network of microRNAs directly and indirectly controls the expression of checkpoint receptors and several microRNAs can target multiple checkpoint molecules, mimicking the therapeutic effect of a combined immune checkpoint blockade. In this review, we will describe the microRNAs that control the expression of immune checkpoints and we will present four specific issues of the immune checkpoint therapy in cancer: (1) imprecise therapeutic indication, (2) difficult response evaluation, (3) numerous immunologic adverse-events, and (4) the absence of response to immune therapy. Finally, we propose microRNAs as possible solutions for these pitfalls. We consider that in the near future microRNAs could become important therapeutic partners of the immune checkpoint therapy.\n",
  "thought_process": "As I delve into the original query, \"The severity of cardiac involvement in amyloidosis can be described by the degree of transmurality of late gadolinium enhancement in MRI,\" my initial impression is that we're seeking a precise link between the transmurality of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) on MRI and the severity of cardiac involvement in amyloidosis. The query seems to aim at understanding how the extent of LGE correlates with the severity of amyloidosis, which is a critical aspect of managing and predicting outcomes for patients with this condition.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that while there's a good foundation of research on LGE's value in assessing cardiac amyloidosis, there's a gap in quantifying this relationship directly. The text snippets from the initial results, such as the one discussing how transmural LGE predicts death and remains an independent predictor after adjustment for other factors, suggest that there's a strong correlation but also highlight the need for more specific and diverse terms to capture the complexity of cardiac involvement in amyloidosis.\n\nTo approach this query expansion, I decide to use a technique that involves identifying ineffective terms, expanding the query breadth, and then diving deeper into specific areas of interest. The ineffective terms like \"severity\" and \"can be described by\" are broad and don't add much specificity to the search. For breadth expansion, terms like \"cardiac function assessment,\" \"disease staging,\" \"imaging biomarkers,\" \"prognostic factors,\" and \"therapeutic targets\" offer a wider scope. However, to really drill down into the relationship between LGE transmurality and amyloidosis severity, I need to focus on depth expansion, particularly around \"imaging biomarkers\" and related terms like \"LGE signal intensity,\" \"regional wall motion abnormalities,\" \"diastolic dysfunction,\" and \"ejection fraction.\"\n\nApplying this structured approach, I start seeing possibilities for how these terms can interconnect. For instance, focusing on \"LGE signal intensity\" can lead to insights into how the intensity of the signal correlates with the severity of amyloidosis, potentially offering a quantitative measure of disease progression. Similarly, exploring \"regional wall motion abnormalities\" and \"diastolic dysfunction\" can provide insights into how amyloidosis affects cardiac function beyond just the extent of LGE.\n\nAs I balance the structured steps with natural thought patterns, I have moments of reconsideration. For example, I initially think about including terms related to \"atherosclerosis\" from one of the text snippets, but upon further reflection, I realize that while it discusses the use of MRI in assessing vascular changes, it's not directly relevant to the cardiac involvement in amyloidosis. However, this tangent does remind me of the importance of imaging biomarkers in assessing disease severity, reinforcing the relevance of terms like \"LGE signal intensity\" and \"ejection fraction.\"\n\nThrough this process, insights begin to emerge from both the structure and intuition. Applying the technique leads to the discovery of specific terms like \"regional wall motion,\" \"diastolic dysfunction,\" and \"ejection fraction\" that are directly related to assessing cardiac function and, by extension, the severity of cardiac involvement in amyloidosis. My intuition also suggests that these terms, along with \"LGE signal intensity,\" capture not just the explicit aspects of what the user is seeking but also the implicit need for a quantitative, measurable approach to assessing disease severity.\n\nSynthesizing this information with clarity, I conclude that the most effective terms for expanding the query, ensuring they are diverse, unique, and relevant, are indeed those that emerged from the depth expansion around imaging biomarkers and cardiac function assessment. The final augmented query, \"regional wall motion diastolic dysfunction ejection fraction lge signal intensity,\" reflects a balanced approach that combines the structured technique with natural thought patterns, aiming to capture the nuanced relationship between LGE transmurality and the severity of cardiac involvement in amyloidosis.",
