  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"What are the types of bariatric surgery?\"... this makes me think of various surgical procedures for weight loss, though the user might actually be trying to understand the different approaches to bariatric surgery, such as surgical methods or types of surgeries for obesity treatment. Hmm, not sure yet... The initial results seem to misunderstand the intent, offering related questions instead of direct answers. \n\nAnalyzing the results, I notice that the top snippets are about questioning the existence or nature of bariatric surgery rather than providing a list of types. This suggests that our current search terms might not be capturing the essence of what the user is looking for. The strengths of our search terms lie in their directness, but the weakness is in their lack of specificity regarding the types of bariatric surgeries. \n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here... Let me approach this using the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal technique, which involves constructing a conceptual graph based on the core concepts, entities, and relationships in the query, and then traversing this graph to find high-value expansion terms. This should help because it allows us to systematically explore related concepts and terms that might not be immediately apparent from the original query.\n\nFollowing the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal approach, I should first identify the core concepts and entities in the original query. Here, the core concept is \"bariatric surgery,\" and the entity we're interested in is \"types\" of this surgery. The search intent is informational, aiming to list different surgical procedures for weight loss. \n\nNow, let's build the conceptual graph. The core nodes include \"bariatric surgery\" and \"weight loss.\" First-order connections involve properties like \"surgical methods\" and \"obesity treatment.\" Second-order connections could include related concepts like \"gastrointestinal surgery\" or \"medical procedures for weight loss.\" The domain context is clearly medical, specifically surgical procedures for obesity.\n\nFor expansion path selection, I identify several promising directions: synonymous terms like \"weight loss surgeries,\" hierarchical terms such as \"types of obesity surgery,\" compositional terms including \"surgical procedures for weight loss,\" and contextual terms like \"bariatric surgery techniques.\" Domain-specific terminology could include terms like \"gastrectomy\" or \"gastric bypass surgery.\"\n\nAs I extract and filter terms, I consider their relevance, distinctiveness, specificity, and searchability. Terms like \"gastric bypass,\" \"sleeve gastrectomy,\" and \"adjustable gastric band\" are highly relevant and specific, offering little lexical overlap with the original query and likely to appear in relevant documents.\n\nApplying the technique leads me to discover terms like \"Roux-en-Y\" and \"Lap-Band,\" which are specific types of bariatric surgeries. This realization connects to what we were exploring earlier regarding the need for a list of surgical procedures. Following the technique pointed me toward these specific surgical methods, but my instinct says we should also consider broader categories like \"restrictive surgeries\" or \"malabsorptive surgeries.\"\n\nThrough this process of applying Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal and exploring related threads, I believe the terms \"bariatric surgery types,\" \"weight loss surgeries,\" \"gastric bypass,\" \"sleeve gastrectomy,\" \"adjustable gastric band,\" \"Roux-en-Y,\" and \"Lap-Band\" would be most effective for enhancing our query. These terms capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, providing a balanced approach between structured technique and natural cognitive patterns.",
