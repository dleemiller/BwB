  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"How can I create my own chatbot from scratch?\", this makes me think of the various components and technologies involved in chatbot development, such as natural language processing (NLP), machine learning, and programming languages. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the fundamental steps and resources required to build a chatbot, I'm not sure yet what specific aspects they're most interested in.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the initial retrieval provides a broad overview of related fields but lacks specific instructions or resources tailored to chatbot development. The text snippets from the initial results, such as \"How can I create a chatbot from scratch?\" and \"Where can I create a website from scratch?\", suggest that users are seeking practical guidance on building projects from scratch, but the results don't delve deeply into the specifics of chatbot development.\n\nTo expand this query effectively, I'll apply the \"Query Expansion Through Journalistic Investigation\" technique, which involves treating the query as a story to be researched and expanded upon. Beginning with query assessment, I identify that the user is seeking practical advice and conceptual understanding of chatbot development. I recognize assumptions, such as the need for programming knowledge, and knowledge gaps, such as the lack of information on specific tools and frameworks.\n\nNext, I consider real-world contexts where this query is relevant, including professional contexts like tech industries, educational settings like computer science courses, and personal situations like hobbyist projects. I also look into specialized communities, such as forums for chatbot developers, and historical or evolving contexts, like the advancements in NLP techniques and the rise of conversational AI.\n\nFor resource investigation, I identify notable experts in the field of chatbot development and their key contributions, such as the development of popular chatbot platforms like Dialogflow and Rasa. I also look into essential terminology and specialized vocabulary, like \"conversational AI\" and \"chatbot architecture\", and fundamental concepts and related skills, such as machine learning and NLP.\n\nCreating diverse headlines to address the query from multiple angles, I come up with titles like \"Build Your Own Chatbot: A Step-by-Step Guide\", \"The Ultimate Guide to Conversational AI Development\", and \"Chatbot Architectures Explained: Choosing the Right Approach\". From these headlines, I extract specific terms that represent precise concepts related to the query, such as \"Python\", \"NLP techniques\", \"chatbot framework\", and \"deployment\".\n\nAs I apply the technique, I notice that the process is revealing insights into the user's needs, such as the desire to understand the core components of a chatbot, choose the right programming language and framework, and deploy the chatbot effectively. I also consider intuitive connections that complement the technique, such as the importance of user experience in chatbot design and the potential applications of chatbots in various industries.\n\nAt times, I reconsider my approach, adjusting the technique to better fit the user's query. For instance, I realize that while the user asks about building a chatbot from scratch, they might also be interested in learning about existing chatbot platforms and how to integrate them into their project. This leads me to explore related concepts, such as the pros and cons of using pre-built chatbot frameworks versus developing a custom solution.\n\nThrough this process of applying the \"Query Expansion Through Journalistic Investigation\" technique and exploring related threads, I believe the most effective terms for a BM25 index would be those that capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, such as \"chatbot development\", \"NLP techniques\", \"Python\", \"deployment\", and \"integration\". These terms emerge logically from both the technique and natural insights, providing a comprehensive foundation for further research and exploration.",
