  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"What was PepsiCo Inc's IPO price? What would 100 shares be worth today?\" this makes me think of financial data and stock market information. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the historical performance of PepsiCo or the value of an investment, hmm, not sure yet...\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that they are irrelevant as they do not pertain to financial history or stock market information. The current results seem to be about other companies' IPO prices, which isn't helpful. The search terms used are too broad, like \"what,\" \"would,\" \"be,\" and \"worth.\" These terms don't provide any specific information about PepsiCo or its financial performance.\n\nTo improve the query, I'll use a structured approach. Let me apply the technique of query expansion, which involves identifying ineffective terms, performing breadth expansion, and then depth expansion. This should help because it allows me to systematically explore related concepts and terms that can provide more accurate results.\n\nStarting with breadth expansion, I'll introduce terms like \"initial public offering (IPO),\" \"stock market,\" \"share price,\" \"financial performance,\" and \"market capitalization.\" These terms are more specific and relevant to the query.\n\nNow, let's dive deeper into one of these topics. I'll choose \"IPO\" and explore related terms like \"IPO date,\" \"first-day trading volume,\" \"underwriting firm,\" \"investment bankers,\" and \"investor demand.\" These terms can provide more detailed information about PepsiCo's IPO and its current stock performance.\n\nAs I apply this technique, I'm also considering my intuition and experience. I notice that the terms \"share price\" and \"financial performance\" are closely related to the user's question. I'll make sure to include these terms in the expanded query.\n\nFollowing the technique's steps, I should first identify the most relevant terms from the depth expansion. In this case, \"IPO date,\" \"underwriting firm,\" \"investment bankers,\" and \"investor demand\" seem promising. Then, I'll combine these terms with other high-relevance terms like \"share price\" to create a more targeted query.\n\nWait, that's not quite right for this query. Let me adjust my approach. Instead of using all the terms from the depth expansion, I'll focus on the most critical ones. I'll use \"IPO date,\" \"underwriting firm,\" and \"share price\" as the primary terms. This will help me avoid using too many broad terms and ensure that the query is more precise.\n\nThis step of the technique is revealing some interesting insights. The term \"IPO date\" is crucial in understanding the historical context of PepsiCo's stock performance. The \"underwriting firm\" and \"investment bankers\" can provide information about the company's financial dealings during the IPO. And \"share price\" is essential for calculating the current worth of 100 shares.\n\nI just had a realization that connects to what we were exploring earlier. The user's question about the worth of 100 shares today is closely related to the company's current financial performance. I'll make sure to include terms that can provide this information.\n\nThrough this process of applying the query expansion technique and exploring related threads, I believe the augmented query should include terms like \"PepsiCo IPO date,\" \"underwriting firm,\" \"investment bankers,\" \"investor demand,\" and \"share price.\" These terms capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking.\n\nHowever, to ensure the query is novel and free from overlapping the original terms, I'll refine it further. The final augmented query should be \"PepsiCo IPO date underwriting firm investment bankers investor demand share price.\" This query is more targeted and diverse, introducing new dimensions to the original query without using logical operators or duplicate terms.",
