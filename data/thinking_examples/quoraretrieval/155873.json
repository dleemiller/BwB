  "reasoning": "The original query 'Does Rama eat meat?' seeks to understand the dietary practices of Lord Rama, a central figure in Hindu mythology. The current search results indicate a lack of focus on this specific context and instead cover general discussions about meat consumption, animal diets, health guidelines, and cultural perspectives without any reference to Lord Rama's mythological narratives or religious texts. The strengths of the existing results lie in their broad coverage of dietary practices, but they miss the mark due to their irrelevance to the query's intent regarding a specific mythological figure. To address this issue, a conceptual graph must be constructed to identify relevant semantic connections and domain-specific terms that can guide the search toward authoritative sources on Lord Rama's diet. By selecting expansion paths based on synonymous terms within Hindu mythology, hierarchical concepts related to Vedic dietary practices, contextual terms linked to Indian epic narratives, and domain-specific terminology from religious texts, we aim to enhance the query with precise and relevant expansion terms.",

  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query \"Does Rama eat meat?\", this makes me think of various mythological figures and their dietary habits, though the user might actually be trying to understand the specific context of Lord Rama's diet within Hindu mythology. The initial results seem to be quite off the mark, discussing pandas, Quran, and veganism, which indicates that the current search terms are too broad and lack focus on the mythological aspect of Lord Rama.\n\nUpon analyzing the original query, I notice that the core concepts revolve around Lord Rama and his dietary practices, specifically regarding meat consumption. The search intent is clearly informational, aiming to understand a specific aspect of Hindu mythology. There's an implicit assumption that Lord Rama's diet might be influenced by Vedic or epic texts, such as the Ramayana.\n\nTo better approach this, I'll use the technique of query expansion via conceptual graph traversal. This involves constructing a graph with core nodes representing Lord Rama and meat consumption, first-order connections to religious practices and narratives, second-order connections to cultural significance and interpretations, and domain contexts within Hindu mythology and religious texts.\n\nFollowing the technique, I identify promising expansion paths, including synonymous terms like \"Lord Rama's dietary habits,\" hierarchical terms such as \"Hindu mythological figures and their diets,\" compositional terms like \"Vedic dietary practices,\" and contextual terms such as \"dietary customs in the Ramayana.\" I also consider domain-specific terminology like \"Vegetarianism in Hinduism.\"\n\nAs I extract and filter terms, I focus on their relevance, distinctiveness, specificity, and searchability. This process leads me to terms like \"Ramayana dietary practices,\" \"Hindu mythological diet,\" \"Vedic vegetarianism,\" and \"Epic narratives food customs,\" which seem to capture the essence of what the user is looking for.\n\nOccasionally, I find myself reconsidering the inclusion of certain terms, wondering if they might be too specific or too broad. For instance, including \"Veganism\" might not be directly relevant, despite its connection to vegetarianism, because it introduces a modern dietary concept that might not be directly applicable to ancient mythological contexts. However, terms like \"Vedic dietary practices\" and \"Hindu mythology\" seem to offer a good balance, providing a clear direction for the search.\n\nThrough this process of applying the conceptual graph traversal technique and exploring related threads, I realize that the key to a successful query expansion lies in balancing structured steps with natural thought patterns. The technique helps in systematically identifying relevant terms, but it's the intuitive connections and the ability to reassess and adjust the approach that ensure the final terms are both logical and effective.\n\nThe final expanded query, \"lord rama eat meat according ramayana explore hindu mythology vedic dietary practices,\" reflects this balance. It captures both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, combining the original query's intent with the structured approach of query expansion via conceptual graph traversal. This approach not only enhances the search query but also demonstrates how experts think\u2014using structured methods while enriching them with intuition, experience, and creative connections to achieve a more precise and relevant search outcome.",
