  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"What is it like to be an IITian?\"... this makes me think of the personal, emotional, and social aspects of being part of such a prestigious institution. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the daily life, challenges, and experiences of an IITian, the current results seem to focus more on factual data about IITs, missing the human element. Hmm, not sure yet how to capture this essence, but it's clear we need to delve into the subjective, experiential aspects.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that they lack the depth of personal narratives and experiences. The text snippets from the initial results, such as \"What does it feel like to be an IITian?\" and \"What can IITians do to improve Indian railways?\" hint at the broader impact and personal growth associated with being an IITian, but we need more.\n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here... Let me approach this using the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal technique, which involves constructing a conceptual graph and traversing it to find high-value expansion terms. This should help because it allows us to systematically explore related concepts and identify terms that can enhance our query.\n\nFollowing the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal approach, I should first identify core concepts and entities in the original query. Here, the core concepts are \"IITian,\" \"experience,\" and \"feeling.\" The search intent is informational, aiming to understand the personal and social aspects of being an IITian.\n\nNext, I'll construct a conceptual graph with core nodes like \"IITian,\" first-order connections such as \"student life\" and \"academic experience,\" and second-order connections like \"personal growth\" and \"social environment.\" Considering domain contexts, terms related to education and personal development become relevant.\n\nNow, identifying promising directions for query expansion... I see potential in synonymous terms like \"alumni experiences,\" hierarchical terms such as \"engineering student life,\" compositional terms like \"hostel life,\" and contextual terms such as \"IIT culture.\" Domain-specific terminology could include \"campus life\" and \"academic rigor.\"\n\nFor each expansion path, I'll extract high-value terms. From synonymous terms, \"alumni stories\" stands out. Hierarchical terms give us \"engineering education\" and \"college experience.\" Compositional terms offer \"dorm life\" and \"peer interaction,\" while contextual terms provide \"institutional culture\" and \"academic community.\" Domain-specific terms like \"technical curriculum\" and \"research opportunities\" are also valuable.\n\nFiltering these terms for relevance, distinctiveness, specificity, and searchability... I find that terms like \"personal narratives,\" \"student life,\" \"culture,\" and \"social environment\" are particularly strong. They maintain the original search intent while offering fresh pathways for retrieval.\n\nApplying the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal approach leads me to terms like \"emotional journeys\" and \"campus community,\" which actually reminds me of the importance of \"mental health\" and \"support systems\" in the IIT experience. This step of the technique is revealing the complexity of the IITian experience, which encompasses not just academics but also personal and social growth.\n\nI need to consider the next step in the technique, which involves integrating these terms into an augmented query. However, I'm also noticing this interesting pattern where the expansion terms are pointing towards a holistic view of the IITian experience, encompassing academics, personal life, and social interactions.\n\nThrough this process of applying the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal technique and exploring related threads, I believe the terms \"personal experiences,\" \"emotions,\" \"student life,\" \"culture,\" and \"social environment\" would be most effective for enhancing our query. They capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, providing a well-rounded view of life as an IITian.",
