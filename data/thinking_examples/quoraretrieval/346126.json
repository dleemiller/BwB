  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"What do you do when everything in life feels boring?\"... this makes me think of a person who is feeling unfulfilled and lacks excitement in their daily life. Though the user might actually be trying to find ways to overcome this feeling of boredom, I'm not sure yet what specific aspects of their life they're looking to change or improve. The query seems to express a sense of desperation and a desire for a solution to this pervasive feeling of boredom.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the top snippets are essentially rephrasing the question without offering concrete solutions. This indicates a weakness in the current search terms and suggests that we need to dig deeper into the causes of boredom, potential activities to alleviate it, and different perspectives on managing it. The strengths of the current search terms lie in their ability to capture the emotional essence of the query, but they fall short in providing actionable advice or strategies.\n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here... Let me approach this using the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal technique, which involves identifying core concepts, constructing a conceptual graph, selecting expansion paths, and extracting high-value terms. This should help because it allows us to systematically explore related concepts and terms that might not be immediately apparent from the original query.\n\nFollowing the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal approach, I should first identify the core concepts in the query. Here, the core concepts seem to be \"boredom,\" \"life,\" and the idea of seeking solutions or activities to alleviate boredom. The search intent is clearly informational, as the user is looking for advice or strategies to overcome their boredom.\n\nNow, let's construct the conceptual graph. We have core nodes like \"boredom\" and \"life,\" and first-order connections might include concepts like \"activities,\" \"hobbies,\" and \"mental states.\" Second-order connections could involve related concepts like \"therapy,\" \"mindfulness,\" and \"lifestyle changes.\" The domain context here appears to be psychology and self-improvement.\n\nFor expansion path selection, I identify promising directions such as synonymous terms (e.g., \"apathy,\" \"monotony\"), hierarchical terms (e.g., \"emotional states,\" \"psychological conditions\"), compositional terms (e.g., \"leisure activities,\" \"creative pursuits\"), contextual terms (e.g., \"daily routines,\" \"social interactions\"), and domain-specific terminology (e.g., \"existential boredom,\" \"motivational strategies\").\n\nAs I extract and filter terms, I consider their relevance, distinctiveness, specificity, and searchability. Terms like \"find hobbies,\" \"explore new interests,\" \"seek therapy for apathy,\" \"change daily routine,\" \"set new goals,\" \"practice mindfulness,\" \"combat monotony,\" \"rediscover passion,\" \"find purpose,\" and \"overcome existential boredom\" seem to fit these criteria well.\n\nApplying the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal approach leads me to discover terms like \"find hobbies\" and \"explore new interests,\" which could be effective in alleviating boredom. This realization reminds me of the importance of creativity and novelty in combating monotony, which is a related concept that might also be relevant.\n\nThrough this process of applying the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal technique and exploring related threads, I believe the terms in the augmented query capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking. These terms balance the need for activities, lifestyle changes, and therapeutic approaches, offering a comprehensive set of solutions for someone looking to overcome boredom.",
