  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"How will a quantum satellite work?\", my initial impression is that the user is seeking a technical explanation of the operational aspects of a quantum satellite. The query seems straightforward, but I suspect there might be underlying complexities due to the intersection of quantum mechanics and satellite technology. The user might be trying to understand how quantum principles are applied in a space context, which could involve unique challenges and innovations.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the current retrieval results focus on broader concepts related to quantum technology but lack specifics about satellite operation. This indicates a gap in the search results that we need to address. The text snippets from the initial results, such as \"What is a Quantum satellite?\" and \"How does a Quantum satellite work and what would be some of its primary uses?\", suggest that the search engine is attempting to provide relevant information but is not fully capturing the user's intent.\n\nTo better address the user's query, I will apply the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal technique. This involves constructing a conceptual graph based on the core concepts and entities in the original query and then traversing it to find high-value expansion terms. The core concepts here include \"quantum mechanics,\" \"satellite technology,\" and \"functionality.\"\n\nAs I construct the graph, I identify first-order connections such as the properties and attributes of quantum satellites, such as quantum entanglement, cryptography, and communication. Second-order connections reveal related concepts like space exploration, optics, and sensor technology. The domain context is clearly within the field of quantum technology and space exploration.\n\nFor expansion path selection, I identify promising directions such as synonymous terms (e.g., \"quantum communication\" instead of \"quantum mechanics\"), hierarchical terms (broader concepts like \"space technology\" or narrower concepts like \"quantum key distribution\"), compositional terms (parts of a quantum satellite like \"quantum sensors\"), and contextual terms (settings or scenarios where quantum satellites are used, such as \"secure communication networks\").\n\nUpon traversing the graph and applying the expansion paths, I extract terms like \"quantum entanglement,\" \"satellite communication,\" \"space exploration,\" \"quantum cryptography,\" and \"optical systems.\" These terms are high-value because they are relevant, distinctive, specific, and likely to appear in relevant documents.\n\nAs I reflect on the process, I realize that the technique has helped uncover a range of relevant terms that can enhance the search query. However, it's also important to consider natural thought patterns and intuition. For instance, recognizing the importance of security in quantum communication leads me to consider terms related to cryptography and secure data transmission. Similarly, understanding the challenges of operating in space suggests terms related to resilience and adaptability.\n\nSynthesizing the insights from both the structured technique and my natural thought process, I believe the expanded query should include terms that capture the essence of quantum mechanics, satellite technology, and their interaction. Terms like \"quantum mechanics,\" \"satellite technology,\" \"interact,\" and \"function\" are central, and additional terms such as \"entanglement,\" \"cryptography,\" \"space exploration,\" and \"optical systems\" provide valuable context and specificity.\n\nThrough this process of applying the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal technique and exploring related threads, I believe the terms selected would be most effective for a BM25 index. They capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, balancing the need for technical detail with the broader context of quantum satellite functionality.",
