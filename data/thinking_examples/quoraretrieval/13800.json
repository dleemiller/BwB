  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"How can I succeed in medical school?\"... this makes me think of the numerous challenges students face in this demanding field, from academics to stress management. Though the user might actually be trying to understand not just the academic aspects, but also how to navigate the profession effectively, including finding the right specialty, managing their time, and developing essential soft skills. Hmm, not sure yet how to balance all these aspects in a query expansion.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that they touch upon subtopics like exam success, difficulties in medical school, and the cost of education. However, these results lack a holistic perspective on what it truly means to succeed in medical school, encompassing not just academic performance, but also personal well-being, professional development, and ethical considerations.\n\nTo approach this more systematically, I'll use the Query Expansion Through Journalistic Investigation technique. This involves treating the query as if I'm a researcher building a comprehensive story on the subject. First, I assess the query to understand what the user is truly seeking\u2014practical advice, factual information, or conceptual understanding. In this case, it seems the user is looking for a mix of practical advice and conceptual understanding of success in medical school.\n\nNext, I consider real-world contexts where this query is relevant: professional contexts like hospitals and clinics, educational settings like medical schools, personal situations like managing stress, and specialized communities like medical societies. Identifying these contexts helps broaden the scope of potential search terms and angles to explore.\n\nThe resource investigation phase involves finding authoritative sources on the topic. Notable experts in medical education, established methodologies for learning and stress management, essential terminology like \"USMLE\" and \"residency,\" and organizations like the American Medical Association (AMA) are all crucial. Creating headlines for articles that could address the query from different angles helps extract specific, valuable terms. For example, \"Conquering the Medical School Marathon: A Holistic Guide to Success\" or \"Beyond Grades: Cultivating Essential Skills for a Fulfilling Career in Medicine\" suggest terms like \"holistic guide,\" \"medical school marathon,\" \"essential skills,\" and \"fulfilling career.\"\n\nNow, let me apply the technique's steps systematically. First, I identify the user's deeper information needs: understanding key factors contributing to success, identifying strategies for effective learning and time management, developing resilience, exploring career paths, and cultivating soft skills. The important contexts include admission to medical school, pre-clinical years, clinical rotations, and choosing a residency specialty. Key resources to explore include experts in medical education, concepts like burnout prevention, methodologies for efficient learning, and organizations that support medical students.\n\nAs I delve deeper, I notice that applying this journalistic investigation technique is revealing insights, such as the importance of \"balancing academics, wellbeing, and career development\" in medical school. This actually reminds me of related concepts like the need for mentorship, the role of soft skills in patient care, and the impact of stress on learning and retention. I also consider how different specialties might require unique skill sets and knowledge bases, which could inform the search terms.\n\nOccasionally, I have false starts or reconsiderations. For instance, I initially thought focusing solely on academic success would be sufficient, but the more I apply the technique, the clearer it becomes that personal well-being and professional development are equally crucial. This realization leads me to include terms related to stress management, resilience, and career development in the expanded query.\n\nI need to consider the next step in the technique, which involves synthesizing the insights gained. By applying the Query Expansion Through Journalistic Investigation and exploring related threads, I believe the terms that would be most effective for expanding the query are those that capture the holistic view of success in medical school: \"strategies,\" \"success,\" \"medical school,\" \"balancing,\" \"academics,\" \"wellbeing,\" \"career development.\" These terms should help retrieve results that address the user's implicit and explicit needs, providing a comprehensive guide to navigating medical school effectively.\n\nThrough this process, I've seen how the structured approach of the journalistic investigation technique complements my natural thought patterns, allowing for a systematic yet flexible exploration of the query. The final terms emerge logically from both the technique and the natural insights gained during the process, ensuring that the expanded query is both informed and relevant.",
