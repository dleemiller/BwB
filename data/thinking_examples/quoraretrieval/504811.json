  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"Does any airline use WhatsApp as a customer support tool?\"... this makes me think of how airlines interact with their customers, especially in the digital age. The user might actually be trying to find out if there's a specific airline that uses WhatsApp for customer support, or perhaps they're interested in the broader trend of airlines using mobile messaging apps for customer service. Hmm, not sure yet...\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that we're getting some irrelevant information, such as farming tools used in Mesopotamia, which clearly isn't related to our query. The text snippet from document at k=10 is slightly more relevant, as it mentions computer networks in airline services, but it's still not directly addressing our question about WhatsApp.\n\nLet's transition to a more structured approach using the expansion technique. I'll apply the guidelines for specific and diverse expansions, focusing on targeted expansions that introduce new dimensions to the query. According to the guidelines, I should avoid generic or general statements and instead focus on specific task outcomes.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the primary objectives and gaps in the original query. The main goal is to find out if any airlines use WhatsApp for customer support, and the gap is that we're not getting specific information about airlines that use WhatsApp. The ineffective term \"any\" is too broad and doesn't provide much context.\n\nNext, I'll perform breadth expansion by listing candidate terms with increasingly distant concepts to the original query. These terms include mobile messaging apps, airline communication channels, customer service platforms, online support tools, and digital customer engagement. I'll also consider domain-specific terminology, such as CRM software for airlines and automated customer support solutions.\n\nNow, let's go deeper into one of these topics. I'll choose \"messaging app customer service\" and explore related terms, such as WhatsApp business features, airline industry trends, and CRM software for airlines. Applying the technique systematically, I'll consider synonym replacement, conceptual expansion, and contextual expansion.\n\nAs I delve deeper, I'm noticing some interesting patterns. The use of WhatsApp for customer support is related to the broader trend of airlines using digital channels for customer engagement. I'm also seeing connections between CRM software and automated customer support solutions. Wait, that's not quite right for this query... let me adjust my approach.\n\nFollowing the expansion technique, I should focus on targeted expansions that introduce new dimensions to the query. This step of the technique is revealing some insights about WhatsApp business features and their application in the airline industry. Which actually reminds me of the importance of digital customer engagement in the airline industry...\n\nI need to consider the next step in the technique, but I'm also noticing this interesting pattern where airlines are using mobile messaging apps to provide personalized customer support. I just had a realization that connects to what we were exploring earlier... the use of WhatsApp for customer support is not just about providing a new channel for customers to reach out, but also about using data and analytics to improve the overall customer experience.\n\nThrough this process of applying the expansion technique and exploring related threads, I believe the terms \"whatsapp business features airline crm automated customer support\" would be most effective for a search query. They capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, and they introduce new dimensions to the query that can help us find more relevant information.",
