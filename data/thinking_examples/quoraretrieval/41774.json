  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"Who is the genuine seller of Davisco Whey Protein in INDIA? Any user of Davisco Whey, Please come forward,\" this makes me think of a very specific need - finding an authentic vendor for a particular brand of whey protein in India. Though the user might actually be trying to find a reliable source for dietary supplements, the query's focus on \"genuine seller\" and \"Davisco Whey Protein\" suggests a concern for quality and authenticity. The inclusion of \"Any user of Davisco Whey, Please come forward\" indicates the user is also seeking testimonies or feedback from existing users, which could help in identifying trustworthy sellers.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, it's clear that the current search terms are too broad, leading to results that discuss general whey protein topics rather than focusing on the authentic seller of Davisco Whey Protein in India. The terms \"user\" and \"Please come forward\" are not effective in narrowing down the search to find specific sellers or distributors.\n\nTo approach this systematically, I'll use the expansion technique, which involves being specific and diverse, applying varied augmentation techniques such as synonym replacement, conceptual expansion, contextual expansion, and using domain-specific terminology. The goal is to introduce new dimensions to the query without overlapping the original terms.\n\nStarting with goal elucidation and gaps, the primary objective is to identify genuine sellers of Davisco Whey Protein in India. A gap in the original query is its broadness and the inclusion of ineffective terms like \"user\" and \"Please come forward.\" For ineffective term identification, these terms should be avoided as they do not contribute to finding specific sellers or distributors.\n\nMoving to breadth expansion, candidate terms could include fitness supplements, sports nutrition stores, online health marketplaces, protein powder brands, import-export businesses, consumer protection agencies, and dairy product suppliers. These terms expand the query by introducing related concepts that might help in finding the desired information.\n\nFor depth expansion, focusing on \"import-export businesses\" as a key concept, we can delve deeper into related terms such as foreign trade regulations, FDA approval for food imports, Davisco Whey Protein distributorships, Indian bodybuilding federations, certified online retailers, and customer testimonials for whey protein sellers. This depth chain narrows down the search to very specific and relevant areas that are likely to provide information about genuine sellers of Davisco Whey Protein in India.\n\nAs I apply the expansion technique, I notice that following the systematic steps leads to insights such as the importance of FDA approval for ensuring the quality of imported food products, including whey protein. This realization connects to the user's need for a \"genuine seller,\" suggesting that sellers with FDA-approved products would be more trustworthy. Additionally, considering Indian bodybuilding federations and certified online retailers provides a pathway to finding sellers who cater to the demographic likely using Davisco Whey Protein, thereby increasing the chances of finding a reliable vendor.\n\nThrough this process of applying the expansion technique and exploring related threads, I believe terms such as \"Davisco Whey Protein,\" \"FDA approved,\" \"import export businesses,\" \"distributorships,\" \"Indian bodybuilding federations,\" and \"certified online retailers\" would be most effective for finding genuine sellers in India. These terms capture both the explicit need for authenticity and the implicit need for quality and reliability, making them a comprehensive and targeted approach to the user's query.",
