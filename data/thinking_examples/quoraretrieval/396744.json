  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"What is it like to be a Psychology student (undergrad) at UCL?\"... this makes me think of the academic environment, student life, and research opportunities within psychology at UCL. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the specifics of the Psychology program, the faculty, and the resources available to undergraduates. Hmm, not sure yet... The query seems too general, so we need to focus on UCL's Psychology program specifically.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the terms \"What is it like\" and \"student\" are too broad and don't provide much insight into the specifics of the Psychology program at UCL. The text snippets from the initial results also don't seem to be directly related to the query, except for the first one, which asks about the BSc psychology program at UCL.\n\nTo expand the query, I'll use the Breadth Expansion and Depth Chain techniques. I'll start by identifying terms related to the academic environment at UCL, student life, and research opportunities within psychology. Then, I'll apply the Breadth Expansion technique to introduce new dimensions to the query, such as \"UCL academics,\" \"university resources,\" \"research projects,\" \"London student life,\" and \"psychology department.\"\n\nNext, I'll apply the Depth Chain technique to go deeper into one of the topics from the Breadth Expansion. Let's say I choose \"psychology department\" as the topic. I'll then identify terms related to the department culture, faculty expertise, research labs, student societies, and clinical placements.\n\nAs I apply these techniques, I notice that the terms \"department culture,\" \"faculty expertise,\" and \"research labs\" seem to be particularly relevant to understanding the experience of being a Psychology undergraduate at UCL. I also notice that the term \"London student life\" could be useful in understanding the broader context of student life at UCL.\n\nNow, let me take a step back and reassess the query. I think I've identified some useful terms, but I need to make sure they're specific, diverse, and relevant to the original query. I'll also make sure to avoid using generic or general statements and focus on targeted expansions that introduce new dimensions to the query.\n\nAs I synthesize the results, I believe the augmented query should include terms such as \"UCL Psychology department,\" \"research labs,\" \"faculty expertise,\" \"student societies,\" \"clinical placements,\" and \"London.\" These terms capture the specifics of the Psychology program, the academic environment, and student life at UCL, while also introducing new dimensions to the query.\n\nThrough this process of applying the Breadth Expansion and Depth Chain techniques, I've been able to identify high-quality search terms that are unique, diverse, and relevant to the original query. I've also made sure to omit any ineffective words or terms, even if they were used in the expanded terms.",
