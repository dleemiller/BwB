  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"Why do I feel a burning sensation after I pee?\" this makes me think of urinary tract issues, though the user might actually be trying to understand the cause of this specific symptom. The initial results, however, seem to be somewhat off-target, with one discussing a burning sensation while urinating but the others not directly related to the query. This discrepancy tells me that we need to refine our search terms to better capture the user's intent.\n\nAnalyzing the results, I notice that the first snippet directly addresses the symptom but doesn't provide a cause, while the others are unrelated. This indicates that our current search terms are not specific enough to yield relevant results consistently. The task outcomes highlight the need to identify the cause of the burning sensation, find related medical conditions, and discover treatment options. This suggests we're on the right track by considering urinary tract issues but need to delve deeper.\n\nTo approach this systematically, I'll use the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal technique. This involves constructing a conceptual graph based on the query and then traversing it to find relevant expansion terms. The process starts with identifying core concepts and entities in the original query, which are \"burning sensation,\" \"urination,\" and implicitly, \"urinary tract issues.\" The search intent is informational, aiming to understand the cause of a specific symptom.\n\nNext, I construct the conceptual graph. The core nodes are \"burning sensation\" and \"urination.\" First-order connections include properties like \"symptom,\" \"urinary tract,\" and \"infection.\" Second-order connections might involve related conditions such as cystitis or interstitial cystitis. The domain context is clearly medical.\n\nFor expansion path selection, I identify several promising directions: synonymous terms (e.g., \"painful urination\"), hierarchical terms (e.g., \"urinary tract infection\" as a broader concept), compositional terms (e.g., \"bladder inflammation\" as a component), and domain-specific terminology (e.g., \"dysuria\" as a medical term for painful urination).\n\nExtracting and filtering terms, I consider relevance, distinctiveness, specificity, and searchability. Terms like \"UTI,\" \"cystitis,\" \"bladder inflammation,\" and \"dysuria\" emerge as high-value expansion terms because they are directly related to the symptom, provide specific conditions that could cause the symptom, and are likely to appear in relevant medical documents.\n\nThrough this process, insights emerge from both the structured approach and natural intuition. Applying the conceptual graph traversal technique leads to the discovery of specific medical conditions and terms that are closely related to the burning sensation after urination. My instinct also suggests considering the user's potential concern for treatment options, which aligns with the task outcomes.\n\nSynthesizing this information with clarity, I believe the terms \"UTI,\" \"cystitis,\" \"bladder inflammation,\" and \"dysuria\" would be most effective for expanding the query. These terms capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking\u2014understanding and addressing the cause of a burning sensation after urination. The augmented query, \"feel burning sensation pee uti cystitis bladder inflammation,\" incorporates these high-value terms to improve document retrieval.",
