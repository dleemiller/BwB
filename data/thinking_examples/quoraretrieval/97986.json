  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"Why do so many people hate Manchester United?\", this makes me think of rivalries and fan culture, though the user might actually be trying to understand the underlying reasons for negative sentiment towards the club. The presence of ineffective terms like \"hate\" and \"so many\" in the initial query suggests a lack of understanding of nuanced topics related to sports fandom, team performance, historical events, or social factors influencing opinions. \n\nThe initial results provided seem to not only miss the mark on the specific query about Manchester United but also introduce unrelated topics such as hatred towards gay people and beliefs in the Illuminati. This indicates a significant gap in understanding the context and specific factors contributing to the negative perception of Manchester United. \n\nTo approach this, I will use the expansion technique that involves identifying specific and diverse terms that can enhance the query without overlapping with the original terms. The goal is to discover new, relevant documents across various domains that can provide insights into the query.\n\nFirst, I will identify the primary objectives of the query, which seem to revolve around understanding the reasons behind the negative sentiment towards Manchester United. The gaps in the current query and results suggest a need for more targeted terms related to football, fan dynamics, and possibly historical or managerial aspects of the club.\n\nThe ineffective terms \"hate\" and \"so many\" should be avoided as they are too broad and do not contribute to a nuanced understanding of the topic. Instead, I will focus on breadth expansion by considering terms like \"rivalries\", \"fan culture\", \"football management\", \"club finances\", \"transfer market\", \"legacy\", \"media coverage\", and \"social media influence\". These terms introduce new dimensions to the query that can potentially uncover more relevant information.\n\nFor depth expansion, I will choose \"fan culture\" as a topic and delve deeper into related terms such as \"fandom dynamics\", \"online fan communities\", \"social media engagement\", \"forum discussions\", and \"critical analysis of fan perspectives\". This systematic approach should yield a more comprehensive understanding of why people might have negative sentiments towards Manchester United.\n\nApplying the expansion technique systematically, I consider each step's contribution to uncovering relevant information. The breadth expansion provides a wide range of topics, but focusing on \"fan culture\" and its deeper aspects allows for a more nuanced exploration of the query's objectives. This approach balances structured steps with natural thought patterns, as it considers both the systematic application of the technique and the intuitive connections between fan culture, social media, and the perception of Manchester United.\n\nThrough this process, insights emerge from both the structured approach and intuition. For instance, applying the depth expansion technique leads to the discovery of terms like \"fandom dynamics\" and \"critical analysis of fan perspectives\", which are crucial for understanding the complexities of fan culture and its impact on the perception of Manchester United. Additionally, considering the role of \"media coverage\" and \"social media influence\" intuitively connects to how these factors can shape public opinion and contribute to negative sentiments.\n\nSynthesizing these insights with clarity, I believe the terms from the expanded query, such as \"rivalries\", \"fandom dynamics\", \"online fan communities\", \"critical analysis\", \"media coverage\", and \"transfer market\", are most effective for capturing both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking. These terms not only reflect the structured approach of the expansion technique but also incorporate natural thought patterns and intuitive connections, ensuring a comprehensive and nuanced exploration of the query.",
