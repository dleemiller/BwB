  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"Why do people think it's okay to touch a pregnant woman's stomach?\" this makes me think of social norms and boundaries, though the user might actually be trying to understand the psychological or cultural reasons behind this behavior. The query itself seems to be touching on issues of consent and personal space, which can be complex and varied across different cultures and individuals.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the top results are somewhat relevant, discussing the acceptability of touching a pregnant woman's baby bump without permission, but there's a noticeable drift in relevance as we go down the list, with the query at k=2 discussing judgmental people and k=10 being completely off-topic about a TV show. This indicates that the original query might be too broad or not specific enough to yield consistently relevant results.\n\nTransitioning to a more structured approach, I'll apply the expansion technique, which involves identifying ineffective terms, performing breadth expansion, and then depth expansion to discover new, relevant documents. This should help because it systematically explores related concepts and avoids generic terms that don't add much value to the search.\n\nStarting with the breadth expansion, terms like \"pregnancy customs,\" \"body boundaries,\" \"gestational sensitivities,\" \"cultural taboos,\" and \"social etiquette\" come to mind. These terms introduce new dimensions to the query, covering both the cultural and personal aspects of the issue. However, to really dive deep and find more specific insights, I need to choose one of these areas and expand on it. \n\nLet's consider \"cultural taboos\" as it seems particularly promising for understanding why people might think it's okay to touch a pregnant woman's stomach. Following the depth expansion, terms like \"sacred pregnancy rituals,\" \"maternal body symbolism,\" \"ancient beliefs about fertility,\" and \"folklore surrounding childbirth\" emerge. These terms not only provide a deeper understanding of the cultural context but also offer a rich background against which the original query can be better understood.\n\nAs I apply this technique, I'm also having intuitive connections that complement my structured approach. For instance, thinking about \"maternal body symbolism\" reminds me of how different cultures have unique beliefs about pregnancy and childbirth, which can influence their attitudes towards touching a pregnant woman's stomach. This realization connects back to my initial impressions about the complexity of social norms and boundaries.\n\nOccasionally, I find myself reconsidering some terms or exploring tangents that might seem unrelated at first but end up providing valuable insights. For example, thinking about \"folklore surrounding childbirth\" leads me to consider how stories and myths about pregnancy and childbirth can shape societal norms and individual behaviors.\n\nStepping back to reassess, I realize that the terms emerging from this process\u2014such as \"pregnancy customs,\" \"cultural taboos,\" \"sacred rituals,\" \"maternal symbolism,\" and \"folklore childbirth\"\u2014capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking. They introduce new dimensions to the query, avoiding the broad or non-precise terms like \"okay\" and \"it's,\" which were identified as ineffective.\n\nThrough this process of applying the expansion technique and exploring related threads, I believe the terms that would be most effective for a search query are those that combine the depth of cultural understanding with the specificity of the original question. Therefore, the expanded query should include terms like \"pregnancy customs,\" \"cultural taboos,\" \"sacred rituals,\" \"maternal symbolism,\" and \"folklore childbirth,\" as these terms are not only relevant but also targeted and diverse, ensuring non-overlapping results from the original query.",
