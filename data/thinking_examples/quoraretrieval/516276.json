  "thought_process": "As I delve into the query \"How can I make my self physically strong?\", my initial impressions are that the user is seeking advice on improving their physical strength, potentially for overall health, athletic performance, or aesthetic reasons. The query lacks specificity, which makes me think about various aspects of physical strength, such as muscle growth, endurance, and flexibility. I'm also considering the user's current fitness level and goals, as these factors would significantly influence the type of training and advice they need.\n\nAnalyzing the initial results, I notice that the top snippets are quite generic and don't provide much depth. The first snippet is almost identical to the original query, while the second snippet seems unrelated, focusing on becoming a good doctor. The tenth snippet, however, catches my attention, as it mentions developing a strong and influential personality, which might be tangentially related to physical strength, but it's a stretch.\n\nTo expand this query effectively, I'll employ the expansion technique, which involves applying varied augmentation techniques such as synonym replacement, conceptual expansion, contextual expansion, and domain-specific terminology. This structured approach will help me introduce new dimensions to the query while avoiding generic terms.\n\nStarting with goal elucidation and gap identification, I recognize that the primary objective is to improve physical strength, but there are gaps in terms of specific training methods, nutritional advice, and injury prevention. The term \"self\" is quite broad and ineffective, as it doesn't provide much context.\n\nMoving on to breadth expansion, I'll introduce terms that are increasingly distant from the original query. I'll consider resistance training, weightlifting, bodyweight exercises, functional fitness, and calisthenics, as these concepts are related to physical strength. I'll also explore nutrition for athletes, sports performance, and athletic development, as these areas are crucial for supporting physical strength.\n\nFor depth expansion, I'll choose one of the distant but important topics, such as resistance training, and dive deeper into related terms. This will lead me to concepts like progressive overload, compound exercises, isolation exercises, training frequency, rest and recovery, protein intake, and carbohydrate timing. These terms will provide a solid foundation for the augmented query.\n\nAs I apply the expansion technique, I'll balance structured steps with natural thought patterns. I might reconsider some terms, make intuitive connections, and explore tangents that could yield unexpected insights. For instance, I might think, \"Resistance training is a great concept, but I should also consider the importance of nutrition in supporting muscle growth and recovery.\" This could lead me to explore terms like meal planning, supplement routines, and hydration strategies.\n\nThrough this process, I'm starting to see insights emerge from both the structured approach and my natural thought patterns. I'm realizing that the augmented query should include terms like resistance training, weightlifting, compound exercises, protein intake, carbohydrate timing, and progressive overload. These terms capture the essence of physical strength development, from training methods to nutritional support.\n\nIn synthesizing my thoughts, I believe the final augmented query should be: resistance training weightlifting compound exercises protein intake carbohydrate timing progressive overload. This query is specific, diverse, and targeted, omitting ineffective words and terms while incorporating high-quality search terms that will yield relevant results.",
