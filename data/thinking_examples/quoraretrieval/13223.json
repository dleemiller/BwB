  "thought_process": "As I examine the query \"How do I improve on my math skills?\", my first impression is that the user is seeking practical advice, possibly hinting at a self-improvement journey in mathematics. This makes me think of various learning strategies, resources, and perhaps even educational trends in mathematics. However, I'm also considering the possibility that the user might be trying to address a specific challenge or gap in their math knowledge, which could require a more tailored approach.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the system's current response leans towards general self-improvement, which might not directly address the user's desire for targeted math skills enhancement. The initial results from the retrieval at different positions (k=1, k=2, k=10) also indicate a broad scope of skill improvement queries, not strictly limited to math. This suggests that the original query's intent might be somewhat diluted in the response, pointing to a need for query expansion to capture the essence of improving math skills specifically.\n\nTo systematically expand this query, I'll employ the Temporal Evolution Analysis technique. This approach involves analyzing how the topic of math education has evolved over time, including historical foundations, developmental milestones, the current landscape, and emerging trends. By exploring these temporal dimensions, I aim to uncover a diverse set of terms that can effectively capture the user's intent and provide a comprehensive answer.\n\nStarting with the historical foundation, I consider the origins of mathematics in ancient civilizations, the development of algebra, geometry, and calculus, which have laid the groundwork for modern mathematics. Moving through developmental milestones, I note the advent of set theory, the rise of computer science, and the integration of technology in math education, which have significantly impacted how math is taught and learned.\n\nIn the current landscape, concepts such as differentiated instruction, personalized learning, STEM education, and the emphasis on growth mindset are prevalent. These contemporary approaches highlight the evolving nature of math education, focusing on making math more accessible and engaging for learners.\n\nLooking towards emerging trends, AI-powered tutoring, immersive learning experiences through VR/AR, data science literacy, and interdisciplinary problem-solving methods are becoming increasingly important. These future directions in math education suggest a shift towards more technology-driven, adaptive, and holistic learning experiences.\n\nThrough this temporal analysis, I've compiled a range of terms that reflect the historical, current, and future aspects of math education. Terms like \"improving math skills,\" \"effective math learning strategies,\" \"modern math pedagogy,\" \"STEM education resources,\" and \"math tutoring for adults\" emerge from this analysis, providing a comprehensive framework for addressing the user's query.\n\nAs I reflect on the process, I realize that balancing the structured technique of Temporal Evolution Analysis with natural cognitive patterns has been invaluable. The technique provided a systematic approach to identifying relevant terms across different time periods, while my intuitive connections and occasional tangents allowed for a deeper exploration of how these terms interrelate and contribute to a nuanced understanding of improving math skills.\n\nSynthesizing this information, I believe the expanded query effectively captures the essence of the user's original question. By incorporating terms that span the temporal spectrum of math education, we can provide resources and strategies that are not only relevant to current best practices but also grounded in historical context and forward-looking in their approach to learning and teaching mathematics.",
