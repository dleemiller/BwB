  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query \"What are some examples of technology developed in Ancient Rome?\" this makes me think of aqueducts, roads, and concrete, though the user might actually be trying to understand the broader scope of Roman technological advancements, including lesser-known innovations. The initial results, however, seem to simply rephrase the query without providing any concrete examples of Roman technology, indicating a need for a more structured approach to expand the query effectively.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, it's clear that there's a weakness in providing specific examples of technology, which is what the user is seeking. The strengths of the current search terms lie in their broad relevance to Ancient Rome, but they lack specificity regarding technological advancements. This suggests that the expansion should focus on identifying specific technologies, inventions, and engineering feats unique to Ancient Rome.\n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here, but to organize my thoughts and ensure a comprehensive expansion, let me approach this using the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal technique, which involves constructing a conceptual graph and traversing it to find high-value expansion terms. This should help because it systematically explores related concepts and terms that are directly and indirectly connected to the original query, potentially uncovering more precise examples of Roman technology.\n\nFollowing the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal approach, I first identify core concepts and entities in the original query, such as \"Ancient Rome\" and \"technology.\" The search intent is informational, aiming to discover examples of technological developments. Implicit assumptions include the consideration of engineering feats, materials, and inventions as aspects of technology.\n\nNext, I construct a conceptual graph. The core nodes are \"Ancient Rome\" and \"technology.\" First-order connections include terms like \"engineering,\" \"inventions,\" and \"materials.\" Second-order connections might involve \"architecture,\" \"water supply systems,\" and \"military technology.\" Domain contexts include history, archaeology, and engineering.\n\nFor expansion path selection, I identify promising directions such as synonymous terms (e.g., \"innovations\" for \"technology\"), hierarchical terms (e.g., \"civil engineering\" as a narrower concept), compositional terms (e.g., \"concrete\" as a material used in Roman constructions), contextual terms (e.g., \"urban development\"), and domain-specific terminology (e.g., \"Roman architecture\").\n\nUpon traversing these paths, I extract high-value terms such as \"aqueducts,\" \"roads,\" \"concrete,\" \"waterwheels,\" \"baths,\" \"sewage systems,\" \"architecture,\" \"engineering feats,\" \"inventions,\" and \"materials science.\" These terms are relevant, distinctive, specific, and likely to appear in relevant documents.\n\nApplying the technique leads me to realize that terms like \"aqueducts\" and \"concrete\" are not just examples but also indicative of broader technological capabilities, such as water management and materials science. This insight connects to what we were exploring earlier regarding the need for specific examples of Roman technology, suggesting that the expanded query should not only list inventions but also delve into the areas of engineering and material science that made these inventions possible.\n\nThrough this process, I've come to understand that the original query, while straightforward, requires a nuanced approach to expand effectively. The technique has systematically guided me toward terms that capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking\u2014specific examples of technology developed in Ancient Rome, encompassing inventions, engineering feats, and materials used in construction.\n\nSynthesizing this information with clarity, I believe the terms that would be most effective for a BM25 index are those that directly relate to Roman technological advancements, such as \"aqueducts,\" \"concrete,\" \"roads,\" \"waterwheels,\" \"baths,\" and \"sewage systems,\" alongside broader terms like \"engineering feats,\" \"inventions,\" and \"materials science.\" These capture the essence of Roman technological development and would enhance the retrieval of relevant documents.",
