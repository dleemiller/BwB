  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"What are some good resources to learn Tagalog?\", this makes me think of language learning platforms, textbooks, and perhaps cultural immersion programs. Though the user might actually be trying to find something more specific, like online courses or language exchange websites, hmm, not sure yet... The initial results seem irrelevant, indicating a failure to grasp the user's intent, which is to find resources rather than engage in discussions.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the terms \"good\" and \"resources\" are quite broad and don't provide much direction for finding specific learning materials. The text snippets from the initial results, such as \"What are the best resources for learning Tagalog?\" and \"What are the best resources for learning a new language?\", suggest that the user is looking for practical information on learning Tagalog, but the current results are not providing that.\n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here... Let me approach this using the expansion technique, which involves applying specific guidelines to discover new, relevant documents across various domains. This should help because it allows me to systematically explore different aspects of the query and identify targeted expansions that introduce new dimensions to the query.\n\nFirst, I need to elucidate the goals and gaps in the original query. The primary objective is to find resources for learning Tagalog, but there's a gap in terms of specificity and diversity. The ineffective terms \"good\" and \"resources\" should be avoided, as they don't provide much direction for finding specific learning materials.\n\nNext, I'll apply breadth expansion to list candidate terms with increasingly distant concepts to the original query. This includes terms like \"online courses\", \"language apps\", \"textbooks\", \"immersion programs\", \"language exchange\", \"cultural centers\", and \"universities\". I'll also consider domain-specific terminology, such as \"Duolingo\" and \"Memrise\", which are popular language learning platforms.\n\nNow, I'll choose one distant but important topic from the breadth expansion, and go increasingly deeper in the related terms on that one selection. Let's take \"online courses\" as an example. Following the expansion technique, I should first identify related terms, such as \"interactive learning platforms\", \"structured lessons\", \"vocabulary building\", \"grammar exercises\", and \"pronunciation guides\". This step of the technique is revealing some useful insights, such as the importance of interactive learning and structured lessons in language learning.\n\nAs I apply the technique, I'm also noticing some interesting patterns and connections. For instance, the term \"Duolingo\" reminds me of other language learning apps, such as \"Memrise\", which could be relevant to the query. I'm also considering the importance of cultural immersion in language learning, which could involve exploring cultural centers, universities, or language exchange programs.\n\nThrough this process of applying the expansion technique and exploring related threads, I believe the augmented query should include terms like \"online courses\", \"Duolingo\", \"Memrise\", \"structured lessons\", \"vocabulary building\", \"grammar exercises\", and \"pronunciation guides\". These terms capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, and they provide a more targeted and diverse set of search terms.\n\nThe final augmented query is: online courses Duolingo Memrise structured lessons vocabulary building grammar exercises pronunciation guides",
