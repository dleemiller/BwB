  "thought_process": "As I delve into the query \"Why does the time go so fast when you're actually doing something with your life?\", my initial impression is that the user is referring to the phenomenon where time seems to accelerate when one is fully engaged in an activity. This makes me think of the concept of flow state, a mental state of complete absorption in an activity, which might be crucial in understanding the user's question. However, the user might also be touching on broader psychological aspects of time perception and how our experiences influence our subjective sense of time.\n\nAnalyzing the original query's results, it's clear that they miss the mark by not fully grasping the experiential and psychological aspects of time perception. The terms \"time\" and \"go\" are too broad and don't capture the essence of the user's inquiry. To improve, we need to identify key concepts related to engagement, focus, and the subjective experience of time.\n\nTo approach this systematically, I will apply the technique of query expansion, which involves identifying ineffective terms, performing breadth expansion to introduce new concepts, and then depth expansion to delve deeper into a selected concept. This technique should help because it allows for a structured exploration of related concepts while also leaving room for intuitive connections and insights.\n\nStarting with the breadth expansion, terms like \"engagement,\" \"flow state,\" \"attention,\" \"focus,\" \"purpose,\" \"meaning,\" \"leisure,\" \"enjoyment,\" \"consciousness,\" and \"absorption\" come to mind. These terms aim to capture the essence of being fully engaged in an activity and how that affects our perception of time. Notably, \"flow state\" stands out as a particularly relevant concept, which is why I've chosen it for depth expansion.\n\nDrilling down into \"flow state,\" we find related concepts such as \"optimal experience,\" \"challenges & skills balance,\" \"immersion,\" \"loss of self-awareness,\" and \"autotelic experiences.\" These terms provide a deeper understanding of what happens when one is fully engaged and how this state influences time perception. The idea of an \"optimal experience\" suggests that the user is looking for a state where their skills are perfectly matched by the challenges they face, leading to a highly engaging and fulfilling experience where time seems to fly by.\n\nAs I apply the technique, I notice that the terms emerging from the depth expansion, such as \"flow state,\" \"optimal experience,\" \"challenges,\" \"skills balance,\" \"immersion,\" and \"autotelic,\" are not only relevant but also diverse and targeted. They introduce new dimensions to the query without overlapping with the original terms. The combination of these terms should provide a comprehensive understanding of why time feels faster during engaging activities and what psychological factors are at play.\n\nIn synthesizing these insights, it becomes clear that the augmented query should focus on these specific terms related to flow state and optimal experience. By doing so, we capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of the user's question, providing a nuanced exploration of time perception during engagement.\n\nThe final augmented query, \"flow state optimal experience challenges skills balance immersion autotelic,\" emerges logically from both the systematic application of the query expansion technique and the intuitive connections made throughout the process. This query is designed to unveil the intricacies of time perception during engaging activities, offering a pathway to understanding the psychological and experiential factors at play.",
