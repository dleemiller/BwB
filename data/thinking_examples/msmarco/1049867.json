Originally released on their 1982 album, Saints & Sinners, the song was re-recorded for their eponymous 1987 album Whitesnake. The song was re-recorded again that year in a new radio-mix version.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: kgb answers \u00bb Arts & Entertainment \u00bb Music Artists & Songs \u00bb Who sang the song never say never again, the theme to a James Bond movie. The theme song to the 1983 James Bond film 'Never Say Never Again' was performed by American singer Lani Hall. See 'Never Say Never Again' lyrics here.

  "thought_process": "As I begin to expand the query \"who sang here i go again\", my initial impression is that the user is looking for the artist who performed the song \"Here I Go Again\". However, the phrase \"here i go again\" is quite common and could be related to various contexts, not just music. This realization makes me think that we need to refine the query to target the correct domain, which in this case appears to be rock music from the 1980s, given the association with Whitesnake.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the top results correctly identify Whitesnake as the performer of \"Here I Go Again\", but there's a risk of irrelevant results due to the ambiguity of the phrase. The text snippets from the initial results, especially the one mentioning the song's re-recording for the 1987 Whitesnake album, reinforce the idea that we're on the right track with Whitesnake but need to delve deeper into related concepts to enhance the query.\n\nTo systematically approach this query expansion, I will apply the technique of conceptual expansion, which involves identifying core concepts related to the original query and then exploring broader and deeper aspects of those concepts. This technique should help us discover new, relevant documents across various domains without overlapping with the original terms.\n\nFirst, let's elucidate the goals and gaps in the original query. The primary objective is to identify the artist who performed \"Here I Go Again\", and the gap lies in the query's lack of specificity, which could lead to irrelevant results. The ineffective terms in the original query, such as \"here\", \"i\", \"go\", and \"again\", are too broad and non-precise, making them candidates for avoidance in our expansion.\n\nFor breadth expansion, we consider terms that are increasingly distant from the original query but still relevant. Concepts like \"heavy metal\", \"hard rock\", \"hair metal\", \"rock ballads\", \"David Coverdale\", \"guitar solos\", and \"power ballads\" come into play. These terms introduce new dimensions to the query, targeting the rock music domain and specifically the style associated with Whitesnake.\n\nNext, for depth expansion, we choose a distant but important topic from our breadth expansion and delve deeper. Focusing on \"power ballads\" and the era of \"1980s music\", we can explore related terms such as \"Whitesnake discography\", specific album tracks like \"Slide It In\" and \"Is This Love\", which are directly associated with the band and the period. This step involves applying the technique systematically while making intuitive connections. For example, the mention of \"David Coverdale\" reminds me of his distinctive voice and how it's a hallmark of Whitesnake's sound, which in turn makes me think of other bands from the same era with similar vocal styles.\n\nAs I apply the conceptual expansion technique, I'm also considering the natural thought patterns that arise from exploring these related concepts. Occasionally, I reconsider certain terms based on their potential to yield irrelevant results or recognize connections between the original query and broader musical trends of the 1980s. For instance, the mention of \"hair metal\" leads me to think about other bands within that genre, such as M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce or Poison, and how they might influence our query expansion.\n\nThrough this process, insights emerge from both the structured approach and my intuition. Applying the conceptual expansion technique leads to the discovery of specific terms like \"Slide It In\" and \"Is This Love\", which are directly related to Whitesnake and fit well within the context of 1980s rock music. My instinct also suggests including terms that capture the essence of the era, such as \"power ballads\" and \"1980s music\", to ensure the query is diverse and targeted.\n\nSynthesizing these insights with clarity, I believe the most effective terms for the augmented query, considering a BM25 index, would include \"Whitesnake\", \"Slide It In\", \"Love Hunter\", \"Is This Love\", \"power ballads\", and \"1980s music\". These terms not only capture the explicit aspects of the user's query but also the implicit desire to explore related concepts within the rock music domain of the 1980s. The final augmented query, \"whitesnake slide love hunter power ballads 1980s music\", reflects a balance between the structured technique of conceptual expansion and the natural cognitive patterns that emerged during the thought process.",
