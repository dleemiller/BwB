  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: A dendritic spine (or spine) is a small membranous protrusion from a neuron's dendrite that typically receives input from a single axon at the synapse. Dendritic spines serve as a storage site for synaptic strength and help transmit electrical signals to the neuron's cell body.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: Certain classes of dendrites contain small projections referred to as dendritic spines that increase receptive properties of dendrites to isolate signal specificity. Increased neural activity and the establishment of long-term potentiation at dendritic spines change the size, shape, and conduction.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: AMP\u2122, 16-04-2017 | Beth Behrs\u2019s adored labrador retriever Spinee has undergone a risky surgery on Tuesday and is luckily beginning the slow process of recovery. The 31-year-old actress has received waves and waves and support for Spinee, as she offered her Twitter followers an update on pooch\u2019s status regularly.\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query \"dendritic spines\", this makes me think of the intricate structures within neurons that play a crucial role in synaptic transmission and plasticity. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the role of these spines in neurological disorders or their function in specific brain regions, the initial query seems to be seeking a basic definition or overview. \n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the top documents provide a good introduction to what dendritic spines are and their general function. However, they lack depth, especially concerning the spine's morphology, plasticity, and involvement in neurological conditions. The text snippet from the document at k=1 gives a clear definition of dendritic spines and their role in synaptic strength and signal transmission. The snippet from k=2 further elaborates on how these spines can change in response to neural activity, affecting signal specificity. Unfortunately, by k=10, the results start to diverge from the topic, mentioning unrelated content like an actress's dog.\n\nTo expand this query effectively, I'll transition to a structured approach using the Conceptual Graph Traversal technique. This involves constructing a conceptual graph around the core concepts of \"dendritic spines\" and then traversing it to find relevant expansion terms. The core concepts here include neuronal structures, synaptic plasticity, brain regions, and neurological disorders.\n\nFirst, I identify the core nodes in the graph: dendritic spines, neurons, synapses, and brain regions like the hippocampus and cortex. Then, I consider first-order connections such as the properties and attributes of dendritic spines (e.g., morphology, plasticity) and their relationships with neurons and synapses. Second-order connections involve related concepts like long-term potentiation, synaptic pruning, and learning and memory processes.\n\nFor expansion path selection, I consider several directions:\n- Synonymous terms: Using terms like \"neuronal protrusions\" or \"dendrite extensions\" could provide alternative pathways for retrieval.\n- Hierarchical terms: Broader concepts like \"neuronal structures\" or narrower ones like \"spine heads\" and \"neck\" could be useful.\n- Compositional terms: Focusing on parts of dendritic spines or related cellular components could enhance the query.\n- Contextual terms: Incorporating terms related to brain regions (e.g., \"hippocampal spine\") or neurological conditions (e.g., \"Alzheimer's disease\") could improve retrieval specificity.\n\nAs I extract and filter terms, I prioritize those that are semantically connected to the original query, distinct from the original terms, precise, and likely to appear in relevant documents. Terms like \"spine plasticity\", \"morphology\", \"brain regions\", and \"neurological disorders\" emerge as high-value expansion terms.\n\nThrough this process of applying Conceptual Graph Traversal and exploring related threads, I believe the expanded terms would be most effective for enhancing the query. These terms capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, providing a balanced approach between structured technique and natural cognitive patterns.\n\nThe final expanded query, incorporating these insights, would be \"dendritic spines plasticity morphology brain regions neurological disorders.\" This query maintains the original search intent while offering valuable alternative pathways for document retrieval, enhancing the chances of finding comprehensive and relevant information on dendritic spines.",
