  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: The Franklin Park Zoo officially opened to the public on October 4, 1912 (although most sources say 1913). According to plans by Arthur A. Shurtleff, the new zoo represented a major departure from Olmsted's original plans, and included more exotic animals.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: Many of the Zoos have them, but often they are only with a few of the animals. The Zoo has done alot of updating their site and park trying to compete with some of the larger Zoos. From what I could find out this Zoo also claims to be the oldest formal Zoo in the US.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: A witness told reporters that Mila seemed to be trying to protect, not harm, Schofield. After Schofield's death, trustees at the Franklin Zoo decided to close the facility and disperse its animals. Mila was a problem given her size, notoriety and the rarity of elephants in the zoos of New Zealand and Australia.\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query \"what kind of animals are at the franklin park zoo\", this makes me think of a straightforward informational search where the user is seeking a specific list of animals found at Franklin Park Zoo. Though the user might actually be trying to plan a visit or learn about the zoo's inhabitants, the core intent seems to be about identifying the types of animals housed there. The current results are too general, discussing zoos in general and not providing the targeted information about Franklin Park Zoo. To improve the results, we need to focus on identifying animals specifically associated with this particular zoo.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the snippets provided give some insight into the history and characteristics of Franklin Park Zoo but don't directly answer the question about the types of animals it houses. The first snippet mentions \"more exotic animals\" but doesn't specify which ones. The second snippet talks about the zoo's updates and competition with larger zoos but again lacks specific information about the animals. The third snippet, although discussing an incident involving an elephant, indicates that the zoo does house significant animals like elephants but doesn't provide a comprehensive list.\n\nTo expand this query effectively, I'll use the conceptual graph traversal technique. This involves constructing a conceptual graph around the core concepts and entities in the original query and then traversing it to find high-value expansion terms.\n\nStarting with query analysis, the core concepts are \"Franklin Park Zoo\" and \"animals\". The search intent is clearly informational, with the user seeking a list of animal species at the zoo. There's an implicit assumption that the zoo houses a variety of animals, but the exact types are unknown.\n\nNext, I'll construct the conceptual graph. The core nodes are \"Franklin Park Zoo\" and \"animals\". First-order connections include properties like \"location\" (Boston), \"age\" (one of the oldest zoos), and \"exhibits\" (though not specified, it implies various animal exhibits). Second-order connections might include related concepts like \"conservation\", \"wildlife\", and \"zoological gardens\". Domain contexts include zoology, wildlife conservation, and possibly tourism or education, given the zoo's role in these areas.\n\nFor expansion path selection, I identify several promising directions:\n- Synonymous terms: Using synonyms for \"animals\" like \"wildlife\", \"species\", or \"creatures\".\n- Hierarchical terms: Broader terms like \"mammals\", \"birds\", or narrower terms like \"primates\", \"reptiles\".\n- Compositional terms: Parts or components related to the zoo, like \"exhibits\", \"enclosures\", or \"habitats\".\n- Contextual terms: Settings or scenarios like \"Boston tourism\", \"family activities\", or \"educational field trips\".\n- Domain-specific terminology: Terms like \"zoological gardens\", \"fauna\", or \"endangered species\".\n\nExtracting and filtering terms, I consider relevance, distinctiveness, specificity, and searchability. High-value terms might include \"Franklin Park Zoo exhibits\", \"Boston zoo animals\", \"New England wildlife\", \"zoological species\", \"primate exhibits\", \"reptile house\", \"conservation efforts\", \"endangered species list\", and \"zoo tours\".\n\nSynthesizing this information, I believe the expanded terms should maintain the original search intent while providing alternative pathways for retrieval. By incorporating terms related to the zoo's specific exhibits, the types of animals it houses, and its role in conservation and education, we can create a more effective query.\n\nThe original query was \"what kind of animals are at the franklin park zoo\". Core concepts include \"Franklin Park Zoo\", \"animals\", and implicitly \"Boston\" and \"zoological exhibits\". Expansion paths include synonymous, hierarchical, compositional, contextual, and domain-specific terms. Expanded terms are \"Franklin Park Zoo exhibits\", \"Boston zoo animals\", \"New England wildlife\", \"zoological species\", \"primate exhibits\", \"reptile house\", \"conservation efforts\", \"endangered species list\", and \"zoo tours\". The augmented query could be \"animals at Franklin Park Zoo, list of species, exhibits, and conservation efforts\".\n\nThrough this process of applying conceptual graph traversal and exploring related threads, I believe the selected terms would be most effective for a BM25 index. They capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, providing a comprehensive approach to finding information about the animals at Franklin Park Zoo.",
