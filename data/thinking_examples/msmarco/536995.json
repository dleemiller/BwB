  "thought_process": "As I look at the original query \"view pay stub,\" my initial impression is that the user is seeking instructions or a method to access their pay stub, likely online. The query seems straightforward, but I recognize that it might encompass a range of possible contexts, such as accessing pay stubs through an employer's portal, understanding the components of a pay stub, or finding out how to obtain past pay stubs. My first association is with online portals and payroll systems that employees use to access their pay information.\n\nAnalyzing the initial results, I notice that they provide some relevant information but are somewhat general. For instance, the first text snippet explains how to read a payroll stub and mentions Online Paystubs (OPS) for employees with direct deposit, which indicates that there are specific systems and platforms for accessing pay stubs online. The second snippet talks about accessing check stubs through a specific page, suggesting that the process might involve navigating through an employee portal or a dedicated payroll system. The tenth result introduces PayStubs Online as a solution for viewing current and past pay stubs, highlighting the cost savings of digital systems over traditional paper-based ones. These snippets provide a starting point but lack the specificity I aim for in an expanded query.\n\nTo systematically approach this query expansion, I decide to use the Conceptual Graph Traversal technique. This involves constructing a conceptual graph around the core concepts of the original query and then traversing this graph to find related terms that can enhance the query.\n\nFirst, I identify the core concepts in the query \"view pay stub\" as \"pay stub,\" \"view,\" and implicitly, \"online access.\" The search intent is informational, with the user seeking a method or instructions. There are implicit assumptions about the context, such as the existence of online portals or payroll systems through which pay stubs can be accessed.\n\nNext, I construct a conceptual graph with these core concepts as central nodes. The first-order connections include properties and attributes like \"online access,\" \"employee portal,\" and \"payroll system.\" Second-order connections might involve related concepts such as \"digital paystub,\" \"paycheck,\" and \"salary statement.\" The domain context here is HR and payroll management.\n\nFor expansion path selection, I focus on synonymous terms (e.g., \"pay slip,\" \"paycheck\"), hierarchical terms (broader concepts like \"payroll\" or narrower concepts like \"pay stub details\"), compositional terms (components of a pay stub like \"gross pay,\" \"deductions\"), contextual terms (settings like \"online portal,\" \"employee self-service\"), and domain-specific terminology (terms specific to payroll software or systems).\n\nExtracting and filtering terms, I consider relevance, distinctiveness, specificity, and searchability. High-value terms might include \"online paystub,\" \"employee self-service portal,\" \"payroll system login,\" \"digital pay slip,\" and \"view paycheck online.\" These terms maintain the original search intent while providing alternative pathways for retrieval.\n\nAs I synthesize my findings, I realize that applying the Conceptual Graph Traversal technique has led to a more comprehensive understanding of what the user might be seeking. The technique's systematic approach has helped identify terms that are both relevant and distinctive, enhancing the original query to better capture the user's intent.\n\nThrough this process, I've come to believe that the most effective expansion terms for a query like \"view pay stub\" would include references to online access, specific payroll systems, and the action of viewing or downloading pay stubs. These terms not only reflect the explicit aspects of the user's query but also tap into the implicit desire for a straightforward method to access pay stubs online.\n\nTherefore, the expanded query could be \"view pay stub online access portal employee self-service login download digital paystub,\" which incorporates terms that emerged from both the structured technique and my natural thought process. This query aims to provide a clear pathway to the information the user is seeking, balancing the need for specificity with the breadth of potential contexts in which one might need to view a pay stub.",
