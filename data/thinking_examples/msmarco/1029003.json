Proof.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: Varignon's theorem is a statement in Euclidean geometry, that deals with the construction of a particular parallelogram, the Varignon parallelogram, from an arbitrary quadrilateral. It is named after Pierre Varignon, who published it in 1731.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: Theorem 1 below is called the Extreme Value theorem. It describes a condition that ensures a function has both an absolute minimum and an absolute maximum. The theorem is important because it can guide our investigations when we search for absolute extreme values of a function.\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query \"what is Varignon's theorem\", this makes me think of geometry and theorems related to shapes and their properties. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the definition, proof, and possibly its geometric interpretation or historical context, given the nature of the query. The initial results provided do indeed point towards a geometric interpretation, with mentions of the Varignon parallelogram, moments of forces, and a proof, suggesting the user is on the right track but might need a more structured explanation.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice strengths in the direct references to Varignon's Theorem, including its definition and geometric aspects. However, a weakness is the lack of a clear, beginner-friendly explanation that ties all these elements together. The results jump between advanced concepts like the moment of resultant forces and the construction of a Varignon parallelogram without much context for someone new to the topic.\n\nTo approach this query expansion systematically, I'll use the Conceptual Graph Traversal technique. This involves constructing a conceptual graph with core nodes from the query, first and second-order connections, and considering domain contexts. The core concepts here are \"Varignon's Theorem\", \"definition\", \"geometry\", and \"proof\". First-order connections include properties of the theorem, like its statement and application in geometry. Second-order connections could involve related theorems in geometry or concepts in physics like moments and forces. The domain context is clearly mathematics, specifically geometry and possibly physics.\n\nGiven this setup, promising directions for query expansion include synonymous terms (e.g., \"Varignon's Theorem\" could also be referred to as \"Varignon's Parallelogram Theorem\"), hierarchical terms (broader concepts like \"geometry theorems\" or narrower ones like \"properties of a Varignon parallelogram\"), compositional terms (components of the theorem, like \"centroid\" or \"median of a triangle\"), contextual terms (settings where the theorem is applied, such as \"architecture\" or \"engineering\"), and domain-specific terminology (technical terms used in geometry or physics related to the theorem).\n\nApplying the Conceptual Graph Traversal technique, I notice that synonymous terms like \"Varignon Parallelogram\" and hierarchical terms such as \"geometry theorems\" or \"polygon properties\" could be useful. Compositional terms like \"centroid\" and \"triangle median\" also seem relevant, given the geometric nature of the query. Contextual terms might include \"architectural design\" or \"structural analysis\", where understanding such theorems could be crucial. Domain-specific terms could involve technical vocabulary from geometry or physics, like \"moment of a force\" or \"parallelogram law\".\n\nAs I traverse the conceptual graph, I am reminded of related concepts like Pascal's Triangle, the Median of a Triangle, Apollonius' Theorem, and Ceva's Theorem, which were listed as nearest neighbors. These could provide additional pathways for understanding or applying Varignon's Theorem, especially in a geometric or mathematical context.\n\nThrough this process of applying Conceptual Graph Traversal and exploring related threads, I believe terms such as \"definition\", \"geometry\", \"proof\", \"centroid\", \"triangle\", and possibly \"architectural design\" or \"structural analysis\" would be most effective for expanding the query. These terms capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, from the basic understanding of the theorem to its applications and related concepts in geometry and possibly physics.\n\nThe final expanded query, considering the weighted selection of the best expansion terms and ensuring the original search intent is maintained, could be \"explain Varignon's Theorem definition geometry proof triangle centroid\", which seems to encapsulate the core concepts and their connections effectively.",
