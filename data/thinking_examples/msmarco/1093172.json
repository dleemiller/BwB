  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query \"mastercard stock prices,\" this makes me think of financial markets and investor interest. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the current market trends affecting Mastercard, the initial results seem to focus more on historical data and lack recent price data or market analysis. I notice that the term \"stock prices\" is quite broad and might not be effective in capturing the nuances of what the user is seeking.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I see that there's a mention of Mastercard's stock price target and performance over time, but it doesn't give me a comprehensive view of the current market situation. The text snippets provided show a mix of historical data, like the 10-for-1 stock split in 2014, and some analyst predictions, but there's a clear gap in recent and relevant market trend information.\n\nTo expand this query effectively, I'll use the technique of combining breadth and depth expansion. This involves identifying ineffective terms, expanding the query to include a broader range of relevant concepts, and then diving deeper into specific areas that are likely to yield high-quality search results.\n\nFirst, I identify \"stock prices\" as an ineffective term due to its broad nature. For breadth expansion, I consider terms like \"financial markets,\" \"investor sentiment,\" \"sector performance,\" \"earnings reports,\" \"competition,\" and \"economic indicators.\" These terms introduce new dimensions to the query that can help capture a wider range of relevant information.\n\nNext, for depth expansion, I choose a topic like \"market trends\" and explore related terms such as \"interest rates,\" \"inflation,\" \"consumer spending,\" and \"global economic growth.\" This helps to drilled down into specific factors that could influence Mastercard's stock performance and provides a more nuanced understanding of the market.\n\nAs I apply this technique, I also allow for natural thought patterns to emerge, such as reconsidering the importance of certain terms or making intuitive connections between different concepts. For instance, considering the impact of interest rates on consumer spending habits and how that, in turn, could affect Mastercard's stock price.\n\nThrough this process, insights begin to emerge that combine both the structured approach of the expansion technique and my own intuitive understanding of the topic. Applying the technique systematically leads me to terms like \"investor sentiment\" and \"earnings reports,\" which are directly relevant to understanding Mastercard's current stock situation. Meanwhile, my natural thought process suggests that factors like \"inflation\" and \"consumer spending\" could have a significant indirect impact on the stock's performance.\n\nSynthesizing these insights, I believe the most effective terms for expanding the query would include those that capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking. This means combining direct financial terms with broader economic and market trend terms.\n\nThus, the expanded query that emerges from this thought process is one that balances specificity with diversity, ensuring that the search results will be novel, relevant, and comprehensive. By avoiding generic terms and focusing on targeted expansions, the augmented query is designed to uncover new and valuable information that addresses the user's underlying questions and needs.",
