  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: How the Scientific Method Works. As more proof that there is no one way to do science, different sources describe the steps of the scientific method in different ways. Some list three steps, some four and some five. Fundamentally, however, they incorporate the same concepts and principles.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: The Scientific Process. A scientific process or scientific method requires observations of nature and formulating and testing the hypothesis. It consists of following four steps. Observe something and ask questions about a natural phenomenon (scientific observation)\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: The scientific method has four steps. 1. Observation and description of a phenomenon or group of phenomena. 2. Formulation of an hypothesis to explain the phenomena. In physics, the hypothesis often takes the form of a causal mechanism or a mathematical relation.\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query \"what are the four steps of the scientific method,\" this makes me think of a straightforward, educational inquiry, though the user might actually be trying to understand the underlying principles or perhaps seeking a specific application of these steps. The query seems simple, but the complexity lies in the variability of the scientific method's representation across different sources. \n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that there's a lack of consensus on the definitive steps, which could lead to confusion. The terms \"what\" and \"are\" seem too broad and don't contribute much to the specificity of the search. The initial results highlight the core steps but also reveal the diversity in how these steps are described and sequenced.\n\nTo expand this query effectively, I'll apply the expansion technique, focusing on being specific and diverse. Starting with the identification of ineffective terms, I've already noted \"what\" and \"are\" as not particularly useful. \n\nFor breadth expansion, terms like \"hypothesis,\" \"experiment,\" \"observation,\" \"conclusion,\" \"analysis,\" \"data collection,\" \"variables,\" \"prediction,\" and \"control group\" offer a good starting point. These terms are directly related to the scientific method but allow for a broader exploration of the concept.\n\nTransitioning to depth expansion, if I choose \"experiment\" as a key topic from the breadth expansion, I can delve deeper into \"experiment design,\" \"controlled variables,\" \"independent variable,\" \"dependent variable,\" \"experimental procedure,\" \"data analysis techniques,\" and \"statistical interpretation.\" This depth provides a richer understanding of what's involved in the scientific method, particularly in the experimentation phase.\n\nApplying the technique systematically, I consider how each step of the scientific method can be expanded upon. For instance, the step of observation can lead to discussions on \"data collection\" and the importance of \"variables\" in an experiment. The hypothesis step can be expanded to include \"prediction\" and how hypotheses are tested.\n\nHowever, I also want to allow for natural thought patterns and intuitive connections. For example, thinking about \"experiment design\" reminds me of the importance of a \"control group\" in ensuring the validity of results. This connection isn't strictly part of the systematic expansion but is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of the scientific method.\n\nAs I synthesize my thoughts, I realize that the expanded query should capture both the core steps of the scientific method and the deeper, related concepts that provide a full picture. The final terms should emerge logically from both the technique and natural insights, ensuring they are relevant, targeted, and diverse.\n\nThrough this process of applying the expansion technique and exploring related threads, I believe the terms that would be most effective for a search query are those that reflect the depth and breadth of the scientific method, such as \"hypothesis,\" \"experiment,\" \"observation,\" \"data analysis,\" \"variables,\" and \"control group.\" These terms capture both the explicit steps of the scientific method and the implicit, underlying principles that are essential for its application.",
