  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query \"what is a signal transduction pathway example\", this makes me think of complex biological processes where cells respond to external signals. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the specifics of how these pathways are structured and function, I'm not sure yet what level of detail they're seeking. The query seems straightforward, but delving into signal transduction can reveal a multitude of intricate mechanisms and components.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that while they provide a good foundation by defining signal transduction pathways, they lack a concrete example that ties all the components together. The strengths of the current search terms lie in their ability to fetch general information about signal transduction, but the weakness is the absence of detailed, illustrative examples that would help a learner or researcher understand the practical application of these pathways.\n\nTo expand this query effectively, I'll approach it using the Temporal Evolution Analysis technique, which involves tracing the historical development, current state, and future directions of the topic. This should help because it allows for the incorporation of a wide range of terminology, from foundational concepts to the latest breakthroughs, thereby enriching the query with both breadth and depth.\n\nStarting with the historical foundation, I consider how the concept of signal transduction has evolved from early ideas like Claude Bernard's 'milieu interieur' to the discovery of hormones and the initial studies on nervous system signaling. The development of the receptor-ligand model and the first identification of protein kinases were crucial milestones. As I move through the developmental milestones, I note the significance of second messenger discovery, the understanding of G-protein coupled receptors, and the elucidation of the MAP kinase cascade.\n\nTransitioning to the current landscape, I see the field has expanded to include signaling networks, kinase inhibitor therapies, and systems biology approaches. Quantitative phosphoproteomics and immunotherapy targeting signaling pathways are also areas of active research. Considering emerging trends, single-cell signal transduction analysis, spatial omics, and computational modeling of complex signaling networks stand out.\n\nNow, applying the Temporal Evolution Analysis technique systematically, I need to identify key terms from each era that could enhance the query. From the historical foundation, terms like 'milieu interieur' and 'hormones' could provide context. Developmental milestones offer terms such as 'G-protein coupled receptors', 'MAP kinase cascade', and 'receptor tyrosine kinases'. The current landscape contributes terms like 'signaling networks' and 'kinase inhibitor therapies', while emerging trends suggest 'single-cell signaling' and 'spatial omics'.\n\nAs I apply this structured approach, I also allow for natural cognitive patterns to influence my thinking. For instance, recognizing the importance of G-protein coupled receptors in many signal transduction pathways makes me realize that including 'downstream effects like gene expression or cell proliferation' could offer a more comprehensive example. This connection is intuitive, stemming from understanding how these pathways ultimately influence cellular behavior.\n\nOccasionally, I reconsider my approach, thinking about how the user might actually use the example in their research or studies. This reflection leads me to include a broader range of terms that could cater to different aspects of signal transduction pathways.\n\nThrough this process of applying Temporal Evolution Analysis and exploring related threads, I believe the terms that would be most effective for expanding the query are those that encompass both the explicit and implicit aspects of signal transduction pathways. The augmented query, \"example of a signal transduction pathway including G-protein coupled receptors, MAP kinase cascade, and downstream effects like gene expression or cell proliferation\", emerges logically from both the technique and natural insights.\n\nThis approach not only enhances the original query with specific, relevant terms but also ensures that the search results will provide a detailed example of a signal transduction pathway, fulfilling the user's request for a concrete illustration of these complex biological processes.",
