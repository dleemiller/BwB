  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: BACKGROUND: Ciguatera and scombroid fish poisonings are common causes of fish-related foodborne illness in the United States; however, existing surveillance systems underestimate the overall human health impact. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to describe existing data on ciguatera and scombroid fish poisonings from outbreak and poison control center reports and to estimate the overall number of ciguatera and scombroid fish-poisoning illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths in the United States. METHODS: We analyzed outbreak data from the Foodborne Disease Outbreak Surveillance Systems (FDOSS) from 2000 to 2007 and poison control center call data from the National Poison Data System (NPDS) from 2005 to 2009 for reports of ciguatera and scombroid fish poisonings. Using a statistical model with many inputs, we adjusted the outbreak data for undercounting due to underreporting and underdiagnosis to generate estimates. ...\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: Many therapeutic agents had been used for the treatment of diabetes mellitus before insulin was discovered and several hundred plants have shown some extent of antidiabetic activity. This study tries to explore which agents were most widely used in Europe in the pre-insulin era. According to the scientific literature and the proprietary drug industry around 1900, more than 100 agents were considered to have hypoglycemic activity. Most of them seem to have been used only occasionally while some others were recommended and marketed to a large extent. Among the medicinal plants, Syzygium cumini (syn. S. jambolanum, Eugenia jambolana), Vaccinum myrtillus and Phaseolus sp. were most common, and other frequently used agents were opium, opium alkaloids, other alkaloids like quinine or Belladonna alkaloids, salicylates, alkaline substances like sodium (bi)carbonate and even strong poisons like arsenic or uranium salts. Syzygium jambolanum seed powder seems to be one of the most intensively studied antidiabetic agents of plant origin.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: Potatoes are a source of glycoalkaloids (GAs) represented primarily by alpha-solanine and alpha-chaconine (about 95%). Content of GAs in tubers is usually 10-100 mg/kg and maximum levels do not exceed 200 mg/kg. GAs can be hazardous for human health. Poisoning involve gastrointestinal ailments and neurological symptoms. A single intake of >1-3 mg/kg b.w. is considered a critical effect dose (CED). Probabilistic modelling of acute and chronic (usual) exposure to GAs was performed in the Czech Republic, Sweden and The Netherlands. National databases on individual consumption of foods, data on concentration of GAs in tubers (439 Czech and Swedish results) and processing factors were used for modelling. Results concluded that potatoes currently available at the European market may lead to acute intakes >1 mg GAs/kg b.w./day for upper tail of the intake distribution (0.01% of population) in all three countries. 50 mg GAs/kg raw unpeeled tubers ensures that at least 99.99% of the population does not exceed the CED. Estimated chronic (usual) intake in participating countries was 0.25, 0.29 and 0.56 mg/kg b.w./day (97.5% upper confidence limit). It remains unclear if the incidence of GAs poisoning is underreported or if assumptions are the worst case for extremely sensitive persons.\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query \"poisonous plants,\" my first thought is that this could encompass a wide range of topics, from plants toxic to humans to those harmful to wildlife or other plants. However, the retrieved documents seem to be focused more on marine biology and fish toxins, which suggests a misunderstanding or misalignment between the query's intent and the search results. This makes me think that the user might actually be trying to learn about terrestrial plants that are poisonous, rather than marine toxins.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that while they provide detailed information on marine biotoxins, they completely miss the mark on what seems to be the user's primary interest: poisonous plants found on land. The strengths of these documents lie in their analysis of fish-related foodborne illnesses and public health concerns, but their relevance to the query about poisonous plants is minimal. This indicates a significant gap between the query's objectives and the retrieved information.\n\nTo bridge this gap, I'll apply the expansion technique, which involves a systematic approach to query augmentation. This technique includes steps like goal elucidation, identifying ineffective terms, breadth expansion, and depth expansion. Starting with goal elucidation, the primary objectives of the query are to identify key characteristics and examples of poisonous plants, understand the effects and symptoms of exposure to different plant toxins, explore the geographical distribution of specific poisonous plants, and examine their historical or cultural significance.\n\nThe ineffective terms identified are mostly related to marine biology, such as \"marine,\" \"fish,\" \"seafood,\" \"ocean,\" \"waterborne,\" and \"biotoxins.\" These terms are not only non-precise but also misleading in the context of the query about poisonous plants.\n\nFor breadth expansion, candidate terms that introduce new dimensions to the query are considered. These include \"toxicology,\" \"herbicides,\" \"phytotoxins,\" \"botanical hazards,\" \"land plants,\" \"plant safety,\" \"wildlife interactions with toxic plants,\" and \"traditional medicine involving poisonous plants.\" These terms aim to diversify the search by incorporating concepts related to the toxicity of plants, their hazards, and their interactions with wildlife and human health.\n\nMoving to depth expansion, the focus is on choosing a distant but important topic from the breadth expansion and delving deeper into related terms. Given the breadth expansion terms, \"phytotoxins\" and \"botanical hazards\" offer a promising avenue for depth expansion. Focusing on specific examples of poisonous plants, such as \"aconite,\" \"belladonna,\" \"hemlock,\" \"castor bean,\" \"monkshood,\" \"foxglove,\" \"solanum,\" and \"cascara sagrada,\" provides a deeper understanding of the types of plants that are toxic and their potential effects.\n\nApplying the expansion technique systematically, I notice that the step of identifying specific poisonous plants leads to insights about their toxic compounds and the symptoms they cause. For instance, aconite is known for its toxicity, affecting the heart, and belladonna for its anticholinergic effects. This systematic approach complements my natural thought patterns, which occasionally wander to consider the historical use of these plants in medicine or their presence in folklore.\n\nThere are moments when I consider false starts or reassess the direction of the expansion. For example, initially, I thought to include terms related to pesticide toxicity, but upon further reflection, I realized that focusing strictly on naturally occurring poisonous plants would better align with the user's query.\n\nIntuitive connections also play a role, such as recognizing the connection between certain plants' toxicity and their evolutionary adaptations to deter herbivores. Brief tangents, like exploring the medicinal properties of plants traditionally used to counteract poisoning, sometimes yield unexpected insights into the complex relationships between plants, humans, and the environment.\n\nStepping back to reassess, I see that the expansion technique, combined with natural cognitive elements, has led to a comprehensive understanding of what the user might be seeking. The technique's structured steps ensure that the expansion is systematic and thorough, while natural thought patterns allow for flexibility and creativity in exploring related concepts.\n\nThrough this process, insights emerge from both the structured approach and intuition. Applying specific aspects of the technique, such as conceptual expansion, leads to the discovery of terms like \"toxicology\" and \"phytotoxins,\" which are crucial for understanding the broader context of poisonous plants. Intuitive leaps, such as connecting the historical use of poisonous plants in medicine to their current study in toxicology, provide additional depth to the query expansion.\n\nSynthesizing these insights with clarity, I believe that the terms derived from the expansion process\u2014such as \"toxicology,\" \"aconite,\" \"belladonna,\" \"hemlock,\" \"castor bean,\" \"monkshood,\" \"foxglove,\" \"solanum,\" and \"cascara sagrada\"\u2014would be most effective for a search",
