  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n... Although the oestrogenic activity of these substances is weaker than that of oestradiol, new chemicals with endocrine disrupting potential continue to be discovered, inadvertent forms of exposure are constantly being identified, and there is increasing concern about cumulative effects. Studies in the 1960s and 1970s characterized the oestrogenicity of a number of industrial compounds and the pesticides o,p-DDT, kepone, methoxychlor, phenolic derivatives and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). In the last 5 years, several environmental chemicals have been added to the list of xenoestrogens, including the pesticides toxaphene, dieldrin and endosulphan, and several different compounds used in the food industry, antioxidants such a t-butylhydroxyanisole; plasticizers such as benzylbutylphthalate and 4-OH-alkylphenols; and substances used in dental restorations, such as bisphenol-A. The relevance of these newly discovered endocrine disruptors to human health is now starting to emerge. The few studies that have investigated their effect in humans point in the same direction: if there is indeed an association between exposure to substances with hormone-disruptive activity and certain disorders of endocrine organs, the incidence of such disorders would be greater in areas where exposure to agents with this activity is high. A closer scrutiny is required to determine whether these newly discovered endocrine disrupting chemicals contribute, together with oestrogenic pesticides, to the exposure of humans to xenoestrogens.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: The incidence and/or prevalence of health problems associated with endocrine-disruption have increased. Many chemicals have endocrine-disrupting properties, including bisphenol A, some organochlorines, polybrominated flame retardants, perfluorinated substances, alkylphenols, phthalates, pesticides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, alkylphenols, solvents, and some household products including some cleaning products, air fresheners, hair dyes, cosmetics, and sunscreens. Even some metals were shown to have endocrine-disrupting properties. Many observations suggesting that endocrine disruptors do contribute to cancer, diabetes, obesity, the metabolic syndrome, and infertility are listed in this paper. An overview is presented of mechanisms contributing to endocrine disruption. Endocrine disruptors can act through classical nuclear receptors, but also through estrogen-related receptors, membrane-bound estrogen-receptors, and interaction with targets in the cytosol resulting in activation of the Src/Ras/Erk pathway or modulation of nitric oxide. In addition, changes in metabolism of endogenous hormones, cross-talk between genomic and nongenomic pathways, cross talk with estrogen receptors after binding on other receptors, interference with feedback regulation and neuroendocrine cells, changes in DNA methylation or histone modifications, and genomic instability by interference with the spindle figure can play a role. Also it was found that effects of receptor activation can differ in function of the ligand.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: A retrospective study carried out recently in a large sample of men, close to the general population, has reported a significant and strong decline in sperm concentration and morphology in the whole of France between 1989 and 2005. We studied these trends within each region of France. Data were obtained from the Fivnat database. The study sample comprised male partners of sterile women in whom both tubes were absent or blocked. They were located at the assisted reproductive technology center. A Bayesian spatio-temporal model with parametric time trends, adjusted for age, was used to model overall time trends for each region. The results show that sperm concentration decreased in almost all regions of France. Among them, Aquitaine showed the highest decrease and Midi-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es had the lowest average for the whole period. ...\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query \"endocrine disruptors,\" this makes me think of various substances that can interfere with the body's hormonal system. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the risks, effects, or sources of these disruptors, it's not immediately clear without more context. Hmm, not sure yet... \n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the current search results lean heavily toward scientific literature, which is great for experts but excludes other users. This tells me that the query could benefit from expansion to cover different user intents and needs, including those from non-expert users who might be concerned about the safety of certain products or environments.\n\nTo tackle this, I'll approach it using the Query Expansion via User Intent and Journey Mapping technique. This involves creating distinct user personas with varying levels of expertise and mapping their information needs throughout their journey from awareness to expertise. By doing so, I hope to identify important terms and concepts that can augment the original query, making it more comprehensive and accessible to a broader audience.\n\nFirst, let's consider the different user personas: a Concerned Parent, an Environmental Science Student, an Endocrinologist, and a Policy Advocate. Each of these personas will have unique goals, motivations, and prior knowledge that influence their search vocabulary and behavior. For instance, the Concerned Parent might start with general terms like \"chemicals that mess with hormones\" or \"toxins in baby products,\" while the Endocrinologist would likely use more specialized terminology such as \"endocrine disruptor mechanisms of action\" or \"receptor binding affinity.\"\n\nBy understanding these personas and their journeys, I can extract high-value terms and contextual vocabulary that reflect how real users would search for information on endocrine disruptors at different stages of their learning process. This includes identifying entry-point questions, intermediate learning milestones, and advanced concepts, as well as recognizing specific scenarios where users need this information, such as problem-solving situations, learning contexts, or decision-making moments.\n\nApplying the Query Expansion technique systematically, I start by identifying initial search terms for each persona, then consider follow-up searches they might conduct after initial results. I also analyze how their vocabulary differs based on expertise and identify any misconceptions or alternative terminology they might use.\n\nAs I delve deeper into the technique, I find that it's revealing insights into the diverse ways users think about and describe endocrine disruptors. For example, the term \"hormone disruptors\" might be more intuitive for non-experts, while experts might prefer \"endocrine disrupting chemicals\" or specific names like \"BPA\" or \"phthalates.\" The technique also highlights the importance of considering contextual scenarios, such as a parent researching safe plastic food containers or a student writing about pesticide effects on wildlife.\n\nThrough this process, I'm seeing how the structured approach of the technique complements my natural thought patterns, allowing me to balance systematic analysis with intuitive connections and creative leaps. It's leading me to consider a wide range of terms and concepts that capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of user queries, from general concerns about safety and risks to more specialized inquiries about mechanisms, exposure, and policy.\n\nSynthesizing these insights, I believe the expanded query should include terms that reflect the diverse user intents and needs, such as \"endocrine disruptors risks effects exposure sources alternatives regulation mechanisms safety health children environment research studies diagnosis treatment policy.\" This comprehensive approach ensures that the search results will be relevant and accessible to a broader audience, providing valuable information for users at various stages of their journey, from initial awareness to in-depth understanding and expertise.\n\nBy combining the structured technique with natural cognitive patterns, I've been able to generate an expanded query that captures the complexity and nuance of user needs, ultimately enhancing the search experience and providing more accurate and helpful results.",
