  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: In this study, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was applied to study the structural aspects of the tomato fruit. The main study was performed on tomatoes (cv. Tradiro) using a 0.2-T electromagnet scanner. Spin-echo images were acquired to visualize the tomato macrostructure. The air bubble content in tissues was evaluated by exploiting susceptibility effects using multiple gradient echo images. The microstructure was further studied by measuring spin-spin (T(2)) and spin-lattice (T(1)) relaxation time distributions. Nuclear magnetic resonance relaxometry, macro vision imaging and chemical analysis were used as complementary and independent experimental methods in order to emphasize the MRI results. MRI images showed that the air bubble content varied between tissues. The presence of gas was attested by macro vision images. Quantitative imaging showed that T(2) and T(1) maps obtained by MRI reflected the structural differences between tomato tissues and made it possible to distinguish between them. The results indicated that cell size and chemical composition contribute to the relaxation mechanism.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: The aims of this study were to determine the concentrations of 4-nonylphenol (NP) and 4-octylphenol (OP) in 59 human milk samples and to examine related factors including mothers' demographics and dietary habits. Women who consumed over the median amount of cooking oil had significantly higher OP concentrations (0.98 ng/g) than those who consumed less (0.39 ng/g) (P < 0.05). OP concentration was significantly associated with the consumption of cooking oil (beta = 0.62, P < 0.01) and fish oil capsules (beta = 0.39, P < 0.01) after adjustment for age and body mass index (BMI). NP concentration was also significantly associated with the consumption of fish oil capsules (beta = 0.38, P < 0.01) and processed fish products (beta = 0.59, P < 0.01). The food pattern of cooking oil and processed meat products from factor analysis was strongly associated with OP concentration in human milk (P < 0.05). These determinations should aid in suggesting foods for consumption by nursing mothers in order to protect their infants from NP/OP exposure. 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Mastalgia is resistant to treatment in 6% of cyclical and 26% non-cyclical patients. Surgery is not widely used to treat this condition and only considered in patients with severe mastalgia resistant to medication. The aims of this study were to audit the efficacy of surgery in severe treatment resistant mastalgia and to assess patient satisfaction following surgery. This is a retrospective review of the medical records of all patients seen in mastalgia clinic in the University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff since 1973. A postal questionnaire was distributed to all patients who had undergone surgery. Results showed that of the 1054 patients seen in mastalgia clinic, 12 (1.2%) had undergone surgery. Surgery included 8 subcutaneous mastectomies with implants (3 bilateral, 5 unilateral), 1 bilateral simple mastectomy and 3 quadrantectomies (1 having a further simple mastectomy). The median duration of symptoms was 6.5 years (range 2-16 years). Five patients (50%) were pain free following surgery, 3 developed capsular contractures and 2 wound infections with dehiscence. Pain persisted in both patients undergoing quadrantectomy. We conclude that surgery for mastalgia should only be considered in a minority of patients. Patients should be informed of possible complications inherent of reconstructive surgery and warned that in 50% cases their pain will not be improved.\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"airport scanners,\" this makes me think of security checkpoints and the technologies used to screen passengers and luggage. Though the user might actually be trying to find information on the types of scanners used, their effectiveness, or the privacy concerns surrounding them, I'm not sure yet. The initial search results didn't quite hit the mark, so I'll need to re-interpret the query and expand it to capture the user's intent.\n\nAnalyzing the results, I notice that they're all over the place - from MRI studies on tomatoes to breast pain treatment. This tells me that the original query was too broad or ambiguous, leading to a wide range of unrelated topics being retrieved. The strengths of the search terms lie in their ability to capture various aspects of scanning technology, but the weaknesses are evident in the lack of focus on airport security specifically.\n\nTo transition to a more structured approach, I'll use the Conceptual Territory Mapping technique. This involves treating the query as a knowledge cartographer would, mapping out the central coordinates, boundaries, landmarks, and detail features of the topic. By doing so, I hope to identify the key concepts, related fields, and important terms that will help me expand the query effectively.\n\nStarting with the central coordinates, I define the core concept as airport security screening technology and establish the cardinal directions as practical (technological aspects) vs. theoretical (privacy and health concerns). The scale for exploration will be granular, focusing on specific technologies and their applications.\n\nBoundary exploration reveals neighboring domains such as transportation security, medical imaging, radiation safety, and privacy law. Noting areas where these territories overlap or connect, I identify potential landmarks like millimeter wave scanners, backscatter X-ray scanners, and TSA regulations.\n\nAs I map the detail features, I fill in specialized terms within each region, labeling them with precise terminology. Historical sites and emerging developments are also noted, such as the evolution of scanning technologies and ongoing debates about privacy and security.\n\nCreating a cartographic legend, I classify the most important terms by region and significance. Selecting terms that would help a traveler navigate this knowledge landscape, I identify synonyms, related technologies, and specific concerns that can be used to expand the query.\n\nThrough this process, insights emerge from both the structured approach and my natural thought patterns. I realize that applying the Conceptual Territory Mapping technique leads me to discover key terms like \"millimeter wave,\" \"backscatter x-ray,\" and \"TSA regulations,\" which are essential for understanding airport security screening technology. My intuition also suggests considering related concepts like radiation exposure, health risks, and privacy invasion, which are crucial for capturing the user's intent.\n\nOccasional false starts and reconsiderations arise as I navigate the complex landscape of airport security. For instance, I initially consider including terms related to medical imaging, but later realize that they're not directly relevant to the query. Intuitive connections between concepts, such as the relationship between scanning technologies and privacy concerns, help me refine the expanded query.\n\nStepping back to reassess, I synthesize the insights gained from both the technique and my natural thought patterns. The final expanded query emerges as a logical combination of structured and intuitive elements: \"airport security screening technology privacy millimeter wave backscatter x-ray radiation health risks TSA regulations body image false positives effectiveness.\"\n\nThis thought process has allowed me to transform the original query into a more comprehensive and effective search query, capturing the nuances of airport security screening technology and the concerns surrounding it.",
