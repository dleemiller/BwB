  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: Curcumin (diferuloylmethane) is being considered as a potential chemopreventive agent in humans. In vitro it inhibits transcription by NF-kappaB, and the activity of lipoxygenase or cyclooxygenase enzymes, which facilitate tumor progression. In vivo it is protective in rodent models of chemical carcinogenesis. Curcumin contains an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone, a reactive chemical substituent that is responsible for its repression of NF-kappaB. In compounds other than curcumin this same electrophilic moiety is associated with inactivation of the tumor suppressor, p53. Here we report that curcumin behaves analogously to these compounds. It disrupts the conformation of the p53 protein required for its serine phosphorylation, its binding to DNA, its transactivation of p53-responsive genes and p53-mediated cell cycle arrest.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: Background Figs are a rich source of soluble fiber. We evaluated the effect of consuming dried California Mission figs on serum lipids in hyperlipidemic adults. Methods In a crossover trial men and women aged 30\u201375 years with elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (100\u2013189 mg/dl) were randomized to add dried California Mission figs (120 g/day) to their usual diet for 5 weeks or eat their usual diet for 5 weeks, then crossed over to the other condition for another 5 weeks. Six 24-hour dietary recalls were obtained. Results Low- and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations did not differ between usual and figs-added diets (Bonferroni-corrected p > 0.017), while total cholesterol tended to increase with fig consumption (p = 0.02). Total cholesterol increased in participants (n = 41) randomized to usual followed by figs-added diet (p = 0.01), but remained unchanged in subjects (n = 42) who started with figs-added followed by usual diet (p = 0.4). During the figs-added diet, soluble fiber intake was 12.6 \u00b1 3.7 versus 8.2 \u00b1 4.1 g/day in the usual diet (p < 0.0001). Sugar intake increased from 23.4 \u00b1 6.5 to 32.2 \u00b1 6.3% of kcal in the figs-added diet (p < 0.0001). Body weight did not change (p = 0.08). Conclusions Daily consumption of figs did not reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Triglyceride concentrations were not significantly changed despite an increase in sugar intake.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: Broccoli consumption may reduce the risk of various cancers and many broccoli supplements are now available. The bioavailability and excretion of the mercapturic acid pathway metabolites isothiocyanates after human consumption of broccoli supplements has not been tested. Two important isothiocyanates from broccoli are sulforaphane and erucin. We employed a cross-over study design in which 12 subjects consumed 40 grams of fresh broccoli sprouts followed by a 1 month washout period and then the same 12 subjects consumed 6 pills of a broccoli supplement. As negative controls for isothiocyanate consumption four additional subjects consumed alfalfa sprouts during the first phase and placebo pills during the second. Blood and urine samples were collected for 48 hours during each phase and analyzed for sulforaphane and erucin metabolites using LC-MS/MS. The bioavailability of sulforaphane and erucin is dramatically lower when subjects consume broccoli supplements compared to fresh broccoli sprouts. The peaks in plasma concentrations and urinary excretion were also delayed when subjects consumed the broccoli supplement. ...\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"Mevacor\", this makes me think of medications related to cholesterol and cardiovascular health, though the user might actually be trying to understand its effectiveness, side effects, or how it compares to other statins. The original query seems quite specific, but it's clear we need to expand it to capture more relevant information. \n\nUpon analyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the text snippets provided discuss various aspects of health, such as the effects of curcumin, fig consumption on serum lipids, and broccoli's potential in reducing cancer risk. These snippets, while interesting, don't directly relate to Mevacor or statins. This indicates the need for a more targeted approach to expand the query.\n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here... Let me approach this using the breadth and depth expansion technique, which involves systematically identifying relevant concepts and then drilling down into those areas to find more specific terms. This should help because it allows us to cover a wider range of topics related to Mevacor while ensuring we're not missing crucial details.\n\nFollowing the expansion technique, I should first identify the primary objectives and gaps in the original query. The user is likely looking for information on Mevacor's efficacy, its mechanism as a statin, its impact on lipid profiles, and its role in managing cardiovascular diseases. However, the query lacks specific terms that could lead to more detailed and relevant results.\n\nNext, I need to consider ineffective terms that might be too broad or non-precise. In this case, simply using \"Mevacor\" alone might not yield comprehensive results, as it doesn't account for related concepts or broader health implications.\n\nFor breadth expansion, I look at concepts that are increasingly distant but still relevant to Mevacor. Terms like \"cholesterol lowering drugs\", \"hmg-coa reductase inhibitors\", \"lipid metabolism\", \"atherosclerosis\", and \"clinical trials\" could provide a good starting point. These terms can help in capturing a wider range of documents related to statins and cardiovascular health.\n\nNow, for depth expansion, I choose one of these distant topics, such as \"hmg-coa reductase inhibitors\", and drill down into more specific terms related to it. This leads me to consider \"hyperlipidemia\", \"dyslipidemia\", \"triglycerides\", \"LDL cholesterol\", and \"statin therapy\". These terms are more targeted and can help in retrieving documents that discuss the specifics of how statins like Mevacor work and their effects on lipid profiles and cardiovascular health.\n\nAs I apply this technique, I'm also considering natural thought patterns - like how these terms relate to each other and to the original query. For instance, the connection between statins, lipid metabolism, and cardiovascular disease is crucial. Intuitively, it makes sense that expanding the query to include terms related to these areas will yield more relevant and comprehensive results.\n\nThrough this process, insights are emerging that combine both the structured approach and my natural thought process. Applying the breadth and depth expansion technique has led me to terms like \"cholesterol lowering drugs\" and \"hmg-coa reductase inhibitors\", which are directly related to Mevacor's mechanism. My intuition also suggests that including terms like \"hyperlipidemia\" and \"dyslipidemia\" will provide valuable context on the conditions these drugs are used to treat.\n\nSynthesizing all this information, I believe the terms that would be most effective for expanding the query are those that balance the breadth of related concepts with the depth of specific, relevant details. Terms such as \"cholesterol lowering drugs\", \"hmg-coa reductase inhibitors\", \"hyperlipidemia\", \"dyslipidemia\", \"triglycerides\", \"LDL cholesterol\", and \"statin therapy\" capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking. These terms are not only relevant to Mevacor but also encompass a broader understanding of statins, lipid metabolism, and cardiovascular health.",
