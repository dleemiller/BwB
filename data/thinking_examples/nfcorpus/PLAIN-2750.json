CONCLUSION: In conclusion, intake of the probiotic strains Lactobacillus plantarum HEAL 9 (DSM 15312) and Lactobacillus paracasei 8700:2 (DSM 13434) reduces the risk of acquiring common cold infections.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n... SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 2), which includes the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (Ovid) (1950 to May week 1, 2011), EMBASE (1974 to May 2011), Web of Science which includes Science Citation Index (from 1900 to May 2011) and Conference Proceedings Citation Index (from 1991 to May 2011), the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, which includes the China Biological Medicine Database (from 1978 to May 2011), the Chinese Medicine Popular Science Literature Database (from 2000 to May 2011) and the Masters Degree Dissertation of Beijing Union Medical College Database (from 1981 to May 2011). SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing probiotics with placebo to prevent acute URTIs. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed eligibility, quality of trials and extracted data. MAIN RESULTS: We included 14 RCTs, although we could only extract available data to meta-analyse in 10 trials which involved 3451 participants. ...\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: Previous studies have suggested that probiotic administration may have therapeutic and/or preventive effects on atopic dermatitis in infants; however, its role in allergic airway diseases remains controversial. To determine whether daily supplementation with specific Lactobacillus gasseri A5 for 8 weeks can improve the clinical symptoms and immunoregulatory changes in school children suffering from asthma and allergic rhinitis (AR). We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study on school children (age, 6-12 years) with asthma and AR. The eligible study subjects received either L. gasseri A5 (n = 49) or a placebo (n = 56) daily for 2 months. Pulmonary function tests were performed, and the clinical severity of asthma and AR was evaluated by the attending physicians in the study period. Diary cards with records of the day- and nighttime peak expiratory flow rates (PEFR), symptoms of asthma, and AR scores of the patients were used for measuring the outcome of the treatment. Immunological parameters such as the total IgE and cytokine production by the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were determined before and after the probiotic treatments. Our results showed the pulmonary function and PEFR increased significantly, and the clinical symptom scores for asthma and AR decreased in the probiotic-treated patients as compared to the controls. ...\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"Preventing the Common Cold with Probiotics?\"... this makes me think of how probiotics have been increasingly recognized for their potential benefits beyond just gut health, though the user might actually be trying to understand the scientific basis and efficacy of using probiotics for preventing common colds, especially in specific populations like children. The mention of dosage and specific strains like Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium suggests a deeper dive into the research is necessary.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, it's clear that the search terms have yielded a strong set of scientific studies, which is reassuring given the need for evidence-based recommendations in health-related queries. However, the initial results also highlight the complexity of the topic, with various strains of probiotics, different dosages, and a range of effects on the immune system and respiratory health. The text snippets from the documents at different positions, such as k=1, k=2, and k=10, provide insights into the specific benefits of certain probiotic strains, the methodologies of the studies (like randomized controlled trials), and the scope of the research (including various databases and populations).\n\nNow, let's approach this using the Temporal Evolution Analysis technique, which involves tracing the historical development, current state, and future directions of the topic to identify a comprehensive set of terms. This should help because it allows us to consider how the understanding and terminology of probiotics in preventing the common cold have evolved, are currently understood, and might develop in the future.\n\nStarting with the historical foundation, it's interesting to note the early understanding of the gut microbiome and its role in immunity, the initial studies on probiotics, and traditional uses of fermented foods containing probiotics. The development milestones, such as the first randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses, mark significant points in the evolution of the topic. Currently, the landscape includes widespread use of probiotics, ongoing research into optimal strains and dosages, and a focus on personalized approaches. Emerging trends point towards novel formulations, the role of the gut-lung axis, and the use of prebiotics and synbiotics.\n\nApplying the Temporal Evolution Analysis, we systematically go through each stage: historical foundation to understand the origins, developmental milestones to identify key studies and terms, current landscape to see the contemporary state of the field, and emerging trends to project future developments. This structured approach complements my natural thought process, which keeps wandering back to the importance of specific strains like Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, the need for personalized dosage, especially in children, and the broad implications of probiotics on immune modulation and viral infections.\n\nAs I balance the structured steps of the technique with my natural thought patterns, I find myself occasionally reconsidering the relevance of certain terms or exploring tangents, like the potential of prebiotics and synbiotics or the impact of probiotics on other viral infections beyond the common cold. However, the technique keeps me grounded, ensuring that I systematically cover the temporal evolution of the topic.\n\nThrough this process, insights emerge from both the structured analysis and my intuitive connections. For instance, applying the specific aspect of the technique related to developmental milestones leads me to the discovery of key terms like \"randomized controlled trials\" and \"meta-analysis,\" which are crucial for understanding the scientific evidence supporting the use of probiotics. Meanwhile, my instinctual connections keep highlighting the importance of strains like Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, which are supported by the historical foundation and current landscape analysis.\n\nSynthesizing all this information with clarity, I believe the terms that would be most effective for expanding the query, considering both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, include \"probiotics,\" \"common cold prevention,\" \"children,\" \"dosage,\" \"Lactobacillus,\" \"Bifidobacterium,\" \"randomized controlled trials,\" \"meta-analysis,\" \"upper respiratory tract infections,\" \"viral infections,\" and \"immune modulation.\" These terms capture the essence of the user's query, balancing the need for scientific evidence, specificity regarding strains and population (like children), and the broader context of immune health and respiratory infections.",
