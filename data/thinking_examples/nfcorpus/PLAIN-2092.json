  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: Silent information regulator two proteins (sirtuins or SIRTs) are a group of histone deacetylases whose activities are dependent on and regulated by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+). They suppress genome-wide transcription, yet upregulate a select set of proteins related to energy metabolism and pro-survival mechanisms, and therefore play a key role in the longevity effects elicited by calorie restriction. Recently, a neuroprotective effect of sirtuins has been reported for both acute and chronic neurological diseases. The focus of this review is to summarize the latest progress regarding the protective effects of sirtuins, with a focus on SIRT1. We first introduce the distribution of sirtuins in the brain and how their expression and activity are regulated. We then highlight their protective effects against common neurological disorders, such as cerebral ischemia, axonal injury, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Parkinson\u2019s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and multiple sclerosis. Finally, we analyze the mechanisms underlying sirtuin-mediated neuroprotection, centering on their non-histone substrates such as DNA repair enzymes, protein kinases, transcription factors, and coactivators. Collectively, the information compiled here will serve as a comprehensive reference for the actions of sirtuins in the nervous system to date, and will hopefully help to design further experimental research and expand sirtuins as therapeutic targets in the future.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: Longevity, lifespan, cancer, cellular transformation, energy, calorie restriction, diabetes--what can tie together such a diversity of hot topics in biomedical research? Emerging findings suggest that the answer lies in understanding the functions of the recently discovered family of proteins known as Sirtuins. Barcelona hosted the first scientific meeting completely focused on these evolutionary conserved protein deacetylases, bringing together experts in the biochemistry to cellular biology, mice models, drug targeting and pathophysiology of these molecules. Their work, summarized here, establishes the Sirtuins as major players in cellular homeostasis and human diseases that act through a whole range of biochemical substrates and physiological processes. Undoubtedly, this is an increasingly expanding field that it is here to stay and growth.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: OBJECTIVE: Among plant foods, grain products, legumes, and seeds are important sources of phosphorus (P). Current data on P content and absorbability of P from these foods are lacking. Measurement of in\u00a0vitro digestible P (DP) content of foods may reflect absorbability of P. The objective of this study was to measure both total phosphorus (TP) and DP contents of selected foods and to compare the amounts of TP and DP and the proportion of DP to TP among different foods. METHODS: TP and DP content of 21 foods and drinks of plant origin were measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry. In DP analysis, samples were digested enzymatically in principle in the same way as in the alimentary canal before P analyses. The most popular national brands were chosen for analysis. RESULTS: The highest amount of TP (667 mg/100 g) was found in sesame seeds with hull, which also had the lowest percentage of DP (6%) to TP. ...\n",
  "thought_process": "As I begin to expand the query on sirtuins, my initial impression is that this topic is deeply rooted in the realm of molecular biology and genetics, particularly focusing on the role of sirtuins in aging, longevity, and disease prevention. The original query seems straightforward, but upon analyzing the initial results, it's clear that there's a wealth of information spanning from the historical discovery of sirtuins to their current applications in medical research and potential therapeutic uses.\n\nLooking at the text snippets from the initial results, it's evident that sirtuins are not just simple proteins but are involved in complex biological processes such as histone deacetylation, energy metabolism, and neuroprotection. The mention of calorie restriction, longevity, and diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's suggests that sirtuins play a crucial role in understanding and potentially treating age-related diseases.\n\nHowever, simply relying on the initial results might not be enough to fully capture the breadth of sirtuin research. This is where the query expansion technique comes into play. By applying the temporal evolution analysis, I can systematically explore how the concept of sirtuins has evolved over time, from their discovery to current research trends and future directions.\n\nStarting with the historical foundation, it's fascinating to see how the discovery of Sir2 in yeast and the subsequent identification of mammalian sirtuins (SIRT1-7) laid the groundwork for understanding their roles in aging and disease. The development milestones, such as the discovery of NAD+ dependence and the link to calorie restriction, provide a clear timeline of how our understanding of sirtuins has progressed.\n\nAs I move through the current landscape of sirtuin research, it becomes apparent that these proteins are being investigated for their potential in treating a wide range of diseases, from cancer and neurodegenerative disorders to metabolic diseases. The focus on sirtuins as therapeutic targets and the development of sirtuin-activating compounds (STACs) underscores the translational potential of this research.\n\nThe emerging trends in sirtuin research, including their role in personalized medicine, epigenetic regulation, and the impact of the microbiome, suggest that this field is continually evolving and expanding into new areas. The consideration of sirtuins in the context of spaceflight and extreme environments even hints at the broader implications of this research beyond human health, touching on aspects of environmental and space biology.\n\nThrough this structured approach, combined with the insights gained from the initial results, I can see how the query can be expanded to include a temporal spectrum of terms. From the historical terms like \"Sir2\" and \"silent information regulator\" to current terms such as \"SIRT1,\" \"resveratrol,\" and \"STACs,\" and looking forward to terms that might emerge in the future related to personalized medicine and epigenetics, the expanded query begins to take shape.\n\nThe final step is synthesizing this information into a coherent and effective query that captures the essence of sirtuin research across its historical development, current state, and future directions. By balancing the structured technique of temporal evolution analysis with the organic thinking inspired by the initial results, I aim to create an expanded query that not only reflects the current understanding of sirtuins but also anticipates future research trajectories.\n\nThis process of query expansion is not merely about adding terms; it's about crafting a query that tells a story of how a field of research has grown, where it stands today, and where it might be headed. It requires a deep understanding of the subject matter, the ability to analyze complex information, and the creativity to foresee potential areas of investigation that have not yet been fully explored.\n\nIn conclusion, the thought process behind expanding the query on sirtuins involves a nuanced interplay between structured analysis and intuitive insights, culminating in an expanded query that is both comprehensive and forward-looking. This approach ensures that the query is not just a collection of terms but a roadmap for navigating the complex and evolving landscape of sirtuin research.",
