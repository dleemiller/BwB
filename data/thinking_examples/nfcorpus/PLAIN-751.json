It needs to be refined to reflect the user's intent, which might involve testing, family history, personal risk, treatment options, or understanding the basics of the genes. The question variations capture common ways people inquire about personal health matters. The underlying motivations identify emotional and practical needs associated with the query. The valuable responses aim for expert guidance with personal experiences, detailed context, and caveats. Interaction patterns show natural follow-up questions and points of clarification.

  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n... Between the orange juice and hesperidin consumption groups, 1,582 regulated genes were in common. Many of these genes are implicated in chemotaxis, adhesion, infiltration and lipid transport, which is suggestive of lower recruitment and infiltration of circulating cells to vascular wall and lower lipid accumulation. Conclusions This study shows that regular consumption of orange juice for 4 weeks alters leukocyte gene expression to an anti-inflammatory and anti-atherogenic profile, and hesperidin displays a relevant role in the genomic effect of this beverage. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT 00983086\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: The selection of meat-type chickens (broilers) for rapid growth has been accompanied by excessive fat deposition. In this study, we analysed 53 candidate genes that are associated with obesity and obesity-related traits in humans, for which we found chicken orthologues by BLAST searches. We have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with significant differences in allele frequencies between broilers and layers in each of the following six candidate genes: adrenergic, beta-2-, receptor, surface (ADRB2); melanocortin 5 receptor (MC5R); leptin receptor (LEPR), McKusick-Kaufman syndrome (MKKS), milk fat globule-EGF factor 8 protein (MFGE8) and adenylate kinase 1 (AK1). To examine associations with fatness and/or body weight, we used birds of extreme phenotypes in F(2) and backcross populations with varying levels of abdominal fat weight per cent (%AFW) and body weight. We then assessed the level of gene expression by real-time PCR. In two genes, ADRB2 and MFGE8, we found significant association with %AFW. The ADRB2 gene was found to have a significantly higher expression in the liver of lean chickens compared with those of the fat individuals. We believe that this approach can be applied for the identification of other quantitative genes. \u00a9 2011 The Authors, Animal Genetics \u00a9 2011 Stichting International Foundation for Animal Genetics.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n... TetA/tetC, tetG and ribosomal protection protein genes were detected in the bioaerosols of all 18 studied buildings. Campylobacter, C. perfringens, Enterococcus, E. coli, and Y. enterocolitica were found respectively in 4, 9, 17, 14 and one nasal flora of workers. One and 10 workers were positive for tetA/tetC and tetG genes, respectively. In swine confinement buildings, hog producers are exposed to aerosolized human pathogens and tetracycline-resistant bacteria that can contaminate the nasal flora. Copyright \u00a9 2010 Elsevier GmbH.

  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query \"BRCA genes,\" this makes me think of genetic testing, breast cancer, and family history. Though the user might actually be trying to understand their personal risk, the implications of a positive test, or the available preventative measures. Hmm, not sure yet, but it seems like the query is too broad and needs to be refined to reflect the user's intent.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the top documents discuss gene expression, genetic testing, and the implications of certain genetic mutations. However, they don't directly address the user's potential concerns or provide personal stories and experiences. The strengths of the search terms lie in their ability to retrieve documents related to genetic testing and gene function, but the weaknesses are that they don't capture the emotional and practical aspects of the query.\n\nLet me approach this using the \"Query Expansion via Community Q&A Patterns\" technique, which involves reframing the query as personal experience questions, identifying hidden motivations, and extracting valuable response patterns. This should help because it allows me to consider how people would naturally discuss and ask about BRCA genes in a community setting.\n\nFollowing the technique, I start by reframing the query as personal experience questions, such as \"What is it like to undergo BRCA testing?\" or \"How did you decide to get tested for BRCA genes?\" This helps me identify potential hidden motivations, like seeking validation or reassurance, personal decision support, or emotional support.\n\nAs I analyze the question variations and answer patterns, I notice that people often ask about the risks and benefits of BRCA testing, personal stories of those who have undergone testing, and the implications of a positive test result. This leads me to extract valuable response patterns, such as first-person experience narratives, expert opinions with credibility markers, and step-by-step practical advice.\n\nApplying the technique's steps systematically, I consider common follow-up questions, frequently debated aspects, and clarifications people often request. For example, people might ask about the cost of BRCA testing, the reliability of at-home tests, or the legal implications of genetic testing results. This helps me identify related questions and topics that people also ask, like the difference between BRCA1 and BRCA2 or the alternative treatments for those with a BRCA mutation.\n\nAs I balance the structured approach with natural thought patterns, I have occasional false starts or reconsiderations. For instance, I might think about the technical aspects of genetic testing, but then remember that the user is likely looking for more personal and emotional support. I also make intuitive connections between the query and related concepts, like the importance of family history or the role of genetic counseling.\n\nThrough this process, insights emerge from both the structure and intuition. Applying the technique leads me to discover new terms and phrases, like \"BRCA gene testing risks benefits personal stories,\" which capture the user's concerns and interests. My instinct also tells me to consider the emotional and practical aspects of the query, like the fear of cancer or the desire for peace of mind.\n\nAs I synthesize the information with clarity, I believe that the expanded query \"BRCA gene testing risks benefits personal stories\" effectively reflects the user's intent and concerns. This query captures both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, including personal experiences, risks and benefits, and emotional support.",
