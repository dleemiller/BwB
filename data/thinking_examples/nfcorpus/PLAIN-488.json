  "reasoning": "The existing documents focus primarily on the scientific understanding of Adenovirus 36 (Ad-36) concerning obesity, offering robust insights into its epidemiology, mechanisms of action, and empirical studies. The strengths lie in their detailed exploration of how Ad-36 might influence adipogenesis and its correlations with obesity across different populations. However, weaknesses include a narrow focus on the virological and microbiological aspects without delving into broader implications like public health strategies or socio-economic impacts.\n\nTo augment the query, it's crucial to expand beyond these confines and consider interdisciplinary insights that can provide a more holistic view of Ad-36 related obesity. This involves integrating knowledge from fields such as public health policy, societal impact analysis, economic considerations of healthcare costs associated with obesity, and preventive strategies. By mapping out this broader landscape, we ensure the search encompasses both scientific evidence and practical implications.",

  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: BACKGROUND: Human adenovirus-36 (Ad-36) is thought to induce obesity by a direct effect of the viral E4orf1 gene on lipogenic enzymes in host adipocytes. Ad-36 prevalence is 30% in obese adults, but prevalence has not been reported in childhood obesity. OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of Ad-36 infection in obese Korean children (age 14.8 +/- 1.9; range 8.3-6.3 years); correlation of infection with BMI z-score and other obesity measures. METHODS: Blood was drawn at the annual school physical exam or clinic visit; Ad-36 status was determined by serum neutralization assay; and routine serum chemistry values. RESULTS: A total of 30% of subjects were positive (N = 25) for Ad-36; 70% were negative (N = 59). Significantly higher BMI z-scores (1.92 vs. 1.65, p < 0.01) and waist circumferences (96.3 vs. 90.7 cm, p = 0.05) were found in infected versus uninfected children. Cardiovascular risk factors were not significantly different. CONCLUSIONS: Ad-36 infection is common in obese Korean children and correlates highly with obesity. Ad-36 may have played a role in the obesity and Type 2 diabetes epidemic in children.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: The aetiology of obesity is multifactorial. An understanding of the contributions of various causal factors is essential for the proper management of obesity. Although it is primarily thought of as a condition brought on by lifestyle choices, recent evidence shows there is a link between obesity and viral infections. Numerous animal models have documented an increased body weight and a number of physiologic changes, including increased insulin sensitivity, increased glucose uptake and decreased leptin secretion that contribute to an increase in body fat in adenovirus-36 infection. Other viral agents associated with increasing obesity in animals included canine distemper virus, rous-associated virus 7, scrapie, Borna disease virus, SMAM-1 and other adenoviruses. This review attempted to determine if viral infection is a possible cause of obesity. Also, this paper discussed mechanisms by which viruses might produce obesity. Based on the evidence presented in this paper, it can be concluded that a link between obesity and viral infections cannot be ruled out. Further epidemiologic studies are needed to establish a causal link between the two, and determine if these results can be used in future management and prevention of obesity.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: Background Several studies have shown that Adenovirus 36 (Ad36) influences the risk of obesity in humans. Clarifying the relationship between Ad36 infection and obesity could lead to more effective approaches for the management of obesity. The objective of this study was to conduct a meta-analysis to confirm the influence of Ad36 infection on obesity and metabolic markers. Methodology/Principal Findings We searched MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library for pertinent articles (including their references) published between 1951 and April 22, 2012. Only English language reports of original observational studies were included in this meta-analysis. Data extraction was performed independently by two reviewers. Weighted mean differences (WMDs) and pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated using the random effects model. Of 237 potentially relevant studies, 10 cross-sectional studies (n\u200a=\u200a2,870) conformed to the selection criteria. ...\n",
  "thought_process": "As I delve into the query on Adenovirus 36 (Ad-36) and its role in obesity, my initial impression is that this is a relatively niche area of research, focusing on the virological and microbiological aspects of how Ad-36 influences adipogenesis and correlates with obesity. The user's query seems straightforward, yet it hints at a broader interest in understanding the implications of Ad-36 beyond just its scientific mechanisms. This makes me think about the potential public health and socio-economic impacts of viral-induced obesity, areas that might not be fully explored in the existing literature.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the documents retrieved primarily discuss the epidemiology, mechanisms of action, and empirical studies related to Ad-36 and obesity. While these are crucial for understanding the scientific basis of Ad-36's role in obesity, they lack a comprehensive view of how this knowledge can be applied to public health strategies, policy making, and the economic considerations of healthcare costs associated with obesity. The strengths of these documents lie in their detailed exploration of Ad-36, but their weakness is the narrow focus without considering broader, interdisciplinary insights.\n\nTo expand the query effectively, I decide to employ the Conceptual Territory Mapping technique. This approach involves mapping out the conceptual landscape surrounding Ad-36 and obesity, identifying central coordinates, boundary areas, landmarks, and detail features. By doing so, I aim to navigate the knowledge landscape more systematically and ensure that the expanded query captures both the scientific evidence and practical implications of Ad-36 related obesity.\n\nStarting with the central coordinates, I identify Ad-36's role in obesity as the primary focus. The existing documents provide a solid foundation for understanding the virus's mechanisms and epidemiological correlations. However, to expand this query, I need to chart the boundaries of this knowledge territory, exploring neighboring domains such as public health policy, socio-economic analysis, and preventive strategies against viral infections.\n\nAs I explore these boundary areas, I come across landmarks such as the need for interdisciplinary studies combining virology and public health, the importance of preventive strategies, and the socio-economic impacts of obesity caused by viral infections. Detail mapping involves filling in specialized features within each region, such as pathophysiological pathways influenced by Ad-36, demographic data from epidemiological studies, and cost analysis reports on obesity management in the context of viral causes.\n\nThroughout this process, I find myself occasionally reconsidering the initial query, wondering if there are aspects I might have overlooked. For instance, the role of other viral infections in obesity or the potential for Ad-36 to serve as a model for understanding other virus-induced conditions. These tangents, while sometimes leading to dead ends, also yield unexpected insights, such as the realization that the study of Ad-36 could inform strategies for addressing obesity more broadly, beyond just viral causes.\n\nApplying the Conceptual Territory Mapping technique systematically, I balance structured steps with natural thought patterns. I adjust my approach as needed, recognizing that the conceptual landscape of Ad-36 and obesity is complex and multifaceted. The technique helps reveal insights that might have been missed through a more linear or narrow approach, such as the importance of integrating public health and virological perspectives or considering the economic burden of obesity linked to infections.\n\nThrough this process, insights emerge from both the structured approach and my intuitive connections. For example, applying the technique leads me to discover terms related to preventive strategies and socio-economic impacts, which complement the scientific focus on Ad-36's mechanisms. I also have realizations that connect to what was explored earlier, such as how understanding Ad-36 could lead to more effective management and prevention strategies for obesity, highlighting the potential for this research to have practical, real-world applications.\n\nSynthesizing my findings with clarity, I believe the expanded query should include terms that reflect both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking. This involves combining the original focus on Ad-36 and obesity with broader considerations of public health implications, socio-economic impacts, and preventive strategies. The final terms for the expanded query, \"Adenovirus 36 (Ad-36) role in obesity, public health implications of Ad-36 related obesity, socio-economic impacts of viral-induced obesity, preventive strategies against Ad-36 transmission, interdisciplinary studies combining virology and public health on Ad-36,\" capture the essence of this holistic approach, blending scientific inquiry with practical application.",
