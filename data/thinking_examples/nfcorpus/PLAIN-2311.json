  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: The cooking-induced changes in the levels of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), and 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in various foodstuffs were investigated. Foods included fish (sardine, hake and tuna), meat (veal steak, loin of pork, breast and thigh of chicken, and steak and rib of lamb), string bean, potato, rice, and olive oil. For each food item, raw and cooked (fried, grilled, roasted, boiled) samples were analyzed. There were some variations in the concentrations of PBDEs before and after cooking. However, they depended not only on the cooking process, but mainly on the specific food item. The highest HCB concentrations were found in sardine, being lower in cooked samples. All cooking processes enhanced HCB levels in hake, while very scarce differences could be noted in tuna (raw and cooked). In general terms, the highest PAH concentrations were found after frying by being the values especially notable in fish, excepting hake, where the highest total PAH levels corresponded to roasted samples. The results of this study show that, in general, cooking processes are only of a limited value as a means of reducing PBDE, HCB and PAH concentrations in food.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n... Results From 446,480 patients, 1539 community-associated MRSA, 1335 healthcare-associated MRSA, 2895 skin and soft tissue infection cases, and 2914 controls were included. After adjustment for MRSA risk factors, the highest quartile of swine crop field exposure was significantly associated with community-associated MRSA, healthcare-associated MRSA, and skin and soft tissue infection case status (adjusted odds ratio, 1.38 [95% CI, 1.13\u20131.69], 1.30 [95% CI, 1.05\u20131.61], and 1.37 [95% CI, 1.18\u20131.60], respectively); and there was a trend of increasing odds across quartiles for each outcome (all P for trend \u22640.01). There were similar but weaker associations of swine operations with community-associated MRSA and skin and soft tissue infection. Molecular testing of 200 isolates identified 31 unique spa types, none of which corresponded to CC398, but some have been previously found in swine. Conclusion Proximity to swine manure application to crop fields and livestock operations each was associated with MRSA and skin and soft tissue infection. These findings contribute to the growing concern about the potential public health impacts of high-density livestock production.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: Dysmenorrhea is the leading cause of recurrent short-term school absence in adolescent girls and a common problem in women of reproductive age. Risk factors for dysmenorrhea include nulliparity, heavy menstrual flow, smoking, and depression. Empiric therapy can be initiated based on a typical history of painful menses and a negative physical examination. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are the initial therapy of choice in patients with presumptive primary dysmenorrhea. Oral contraceptives and depo-medroxyprogesterone acetate also may be considered. If pain relief is insufficient, prolonged-cycle oral contraceptives or intravaginal use of oral contraceptive pills can be considered. In women who do not desire hormonal contraception, there is some evidence of benefit with the use of topical heat; the Japanese herbal remedy toki-shakuyaku-san; thiamine, vitamin E, and fish oil supplements; a low-fat vegetarian diet; and acupressure. If dysmenorrhea remains uncontrolled with any of these approaches, pelvic ultrasonography should be performed and referral for laparoscopy should be considered to rule out secondary causes of dysmenorrhea. ...\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"veal\" and considering the task of expanding it, my initial impression is that this is a broad topic that could encompass various aspects such as culinary, health, environmental, and agricultural perspectives. The user might be looking for information on the nutritional value of veal, its environmental impact, or perhaps its cultural significance in different cuisines. However, without more context, it's challenging to pinpoint exactly what they're after.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the documents retrieved touch upon veal in the context of broader discussions about meat, nutrition, and environmental health. For instance, the first text snippet discusses the effects of cooking on the levels of certain pollutants in various food items, including veal. The second snippet, although not directly related to veal, talks about the health impacts of proximity to swine manure application and livestock operations, which could indirectly relate to veal production. The third snippet seems unrelated at first glance, discussing dysmenorrhea, but upon closer inspection, it highlights the importance of dietary factors in health, which could be a tangential connection to the nutritional aspects of veal.\n\nTo systematically approach the expansion of this query, I will utilize the Temporal Evolution Analysis technique. This involves tracing the historical development of the topic, identifying key milestones, assessing the current state, and projecting future trends. By doing so, we can uncover a richer set of terms that capture the full spectrum of veal's significance across different time periods and contexts.\n\nStarting with the historical foundation, veal has its roots in ancient livestock farming practices. The introduction of veal production in European agriculture marked a significant milestone. Historical developments such as the emergence of vegetarian and animal welfare movements have impacted veal production and consumption patterns.\n\nMoving to developmental milestones, regulations on veal crate systems, the emergence of organic and free-range veal farming, and nutritional studies highlighting veal's protein and mineral content are crucial. Shifts in dietary guidelines reflecting reduced red meat consumption have also affected veal demand.\n\nIn the current landscape, sustainability concerns in veal production, technological advances in livestock management, health impacts of red versus white meats, and market trends showing consumer preference shifts towards plant-based alternatives or ethically sourced meat are relevant.\n\nLooking at emerging trends, the growth of lab-grown meat as an alternative to traditional veal, innovations in feed and farming practices aimed at reducing the environmental footprint, increasing regulatory scrutiny on animal welfare standards, and the integration of precision agriculture in veal production for efficiency are noteworthy.\n\nApplying the Temporal Evolution Analysis, I identify terms such as \"sustainable farming practices,\" \"nutritional studies on red vs. white meats,\" \"historical animal welfare regulations,\" \"current market trends and consumer preferences regarding veal consumption,\" and \"technological innovations in livestock production\" as crucial for the expanded query. These terms not only reflect the current state of veal production and consumption but also its historical context and future directions.\n\nThe process of applying this technique and exploring related threads has led me to insights that connect historical, current, and future aspects of veal. For instance, the nutritional profile of veal, while important, must be considered alongside its environmental and ethical implications. The emergence of lab-grown meat as an alternative highlights a future where traditional veal production may need to adapt to changing consumer preferences and technological advancements.\n\nThrough this systematic and intuitive approach, I believe the terms identified for the expanded query\u2014such as \"veal in environmental health, sustainable farming practices, nutritional studies on red vs. white meats, historical animal welfare regulations, current market trends and consumer preferences regarding veal consumption, technological innovations in livestock production, emerging alternatives like lab-grown meat\"\u2014capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking. These terms reflect a comprehensive view of veal, from its historical and nutritional aspects to its current production methods and future trends, thus providing a robust foundation for further research or inquiry.",
