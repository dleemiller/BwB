  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: Common cancer is an age-related disease. Slow aging is associated with reduced and delayed carcinogenesis. Calorie restriction (CR), the most studied anti-aging intervention, prevents cancer by slowing down the aging process. Evidence is emerging that CR decelerates aging by deactivating MTOR (Target of Rapamycin). Rapamycin and other rapalogs suppress cellular senescence, slow down aging and postpone age-related diseases including cancer. At the same time, rapalogs are approved for certain cancer treatments. Can cancer prevention be explained by direct targeting of cancer cells? Or does rapamycin prevent cancer indirectly through slowing down the aging process? Increasing evidence points to the latter scenario.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: Proteins regulating the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), as well as some of the targets of the mTOR kinase, are overexpressed or mutated in cancer. Rapamycin, the naturally occurring inhibitor of mTOR, along with a number of recently developed rapamycin analogs (rapalogs) consisting of synthetically derived compounds containing minor chemical modifications to the parent structure, inhibit the growth of cell lines derived from multiple tumor types in vitro, and tumor models in vivo. Results from clinical trials indicate that the rapalogs may be useful for the treatment of subsets of certain types of cancer. The sporadic responses from the initial clinical trials, based on the hypothesis of general translation inhibition of cancer cells are now beginning to be understood owing to a more complete understanding of the dynamics of mTOR regulation and the function of mTOR in the tumor microenvironment. This review will summarize the preclinical and clinical data and recent discoveries of the function of mTOR in cancer and growth regulation.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a conserved protein kinase involved in a multitude of cellular processes including cell growth. Increased mTOR activation is observed in multiple human cancers and inhibition of mTOR has proven efficacious in numerous clinical trials. mTOR comprises two complexes, termed mTORC1 and mTORC2. Both complexes respond to growth factors, whereas only mTORC1 is controlled by nutrients, such as glucose and amino acids. Since the discovery of mTOR, extensive studies have intricately detailed the molecular mechanisms by which mTORC1 is regulated. Somewhat paradoxically, amino acid induced mTORC1 activation\u2014arguably the most essential stimulus leading to mTORC1 activation\u2014is the least understood. Here we review the current knowledge of nutrient dependent regulation of mTORC1.\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"rapamycin,\" this makes me think of its potential applications in medicine, particularly in the context of aging and cancer treatment. Though the user might actually be trying to understand its role in cellular processes or its effects on human health, I'm not sure yet. The initial results provide a solid foundation, discussing rapamycin's association with the mTOR pathway, its potential in lifespan extension, and its use in cancer treatment. However, these results lack depth in terms of application and potential limitations.\n\nAs I delve into the expansion technique, \"Query Expansion via Metaphorical Thinking,\" I realize that generating powerful metaphors for the query topic can help uncover hidden connections and provide new perspectives. This approach involves creating diverse metaphors from varied domains, such as nature, mechanics, or art, and then mining them for conceptually related terminology.\n\nLet's start with the metaphor generation process. For rapamycin, I come up with the following metaphors:\n\n- Rapamycin is a conductor, orchestrating cellular processes by modulating the mTOR symphony.\n- Rapamycin is a timekeeper, slowing down the aging clock through mTOR inhibition.\n- Rapamycin is a sculptor, shaping cells and tissues by inhibiting growth and promoting longevity.\n- Rapamycin is a gardener, pruning away unwanted cell growth while nurturing healthy development.\n- Rapamycin is a key, unlocking the potential for longevity and disease prevention by targeting the mTOR pathway.\n\nThese metaphors provide a unique lens through which to view rapamycin's role in cellular processes and its potential applications. By mapping elements from the source domain to the target domain, I can identify key features of rapamycin and its effects on human health.\n\nFor instance, the conductor metaphor highlights rapamycin's role in modulating the mTOR pathway, which is essential for cellular growth and proliferation. The timekeeper metaphor emphasizes rapamycin's potential in slowing down the aging process, which could have significant implications for age-related diseases. The sculptor metaphor illustrates rapamycin's ability to shape cells and tissues, promoting healthy development and preventing disease.\n\nAs I explore these metaphors further, I notice that they provide complementary perspectives on rapamycin's effects. The gardener metaphor, for example, suggests that rapamycin can prune away unwanted cell growth, while the key metaphor implies that it can unlock new therapeutic possibilities.\n\nThe next step involves extracting terminology from each metaphorical domain and identifying terms that illuminate aspects of the original topic. From the conductor metaphor, I extract terms like \"orchestra,\" \"symphony,\" and \"cellular processes.\" From the timekeeper metaphor, I extract terms like \"aging clock,\" \"lifespan,\" and \"mTOR inhibition.\" These terms provide valuable insights into rapamycin's role in cellular processes and its potential applications.\n\nBy extending these metaphors and combining them to create hybrid perspectives, I can uncover additional connections and hidden aspects of the topic. For instance, the combination of the conductor and timekeeper metaphors suggests that rapamycin can orchestrate cellular processes to slow down the aging clock, promoting healthy development and preventing age-related diseases.\n\nThe cross-domain term extraction process involves compiling terminology inspired by each metaphorical domain and identifying terms that offer fresh perspectives on the topic. From the metaphors, I extract terms like \"conductor,\" \"timekeeper,\" \"sculptor,\" \"gardener,\" and \"key,\" which provide a unique lens through which to view rapamycin's role in cellular processes.\n\nThrough this process of applying the \"Query Expansion via Metaphorical Thinking\" technique and exploring related threads, I believe that the following terms would be most effective for a BM25 index: rapamycin, mTOR pathway, lifespan extension, aging mechanisms, cancer treatment, drug dosage, side effects, clinical trials, cellular processes, and tissue remodeling. These terms capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, providing a comprehensive understanding of rapamycin's role in human health and its potential applications.\n\nAs I reflect on this thought process, I realize that the \"Query Expansion via Metaphorical Thinking\" technique has allowed me to uncover hidden connections and provide new perspectives on the topic. By generating powerful metaphors and extracting related terminology, I have been able to create a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of rapamycin's role in cellular processes and its potential applications. This technique has also enabled me to balance structured steps with natural thought patterns, providing a realistic and authentic thought process that captures how a search expert expands a query.",
