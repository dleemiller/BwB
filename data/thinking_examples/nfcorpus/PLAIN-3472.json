Moreover, some dietetic rules appeared to be more difficult to comply with than others, e.g. 82.6% patients remembered they should 'eat more fish' but only 51.3% actually did so. Finally, physicians, as well as patients, displayed a lack of confidence in lipid-lowering diet efficiency. CONCLUSION: Improving patient education, especially concerning their perception of risk, as well as increasing the involvement of dieticians, are motivators to explore in order to improve adherence.

Sixty-five percent responded. Among the general practitioners, 86% (95% confidence interval 81-91) reported to have used placebo interventions at least once, and 48% (41-55) to have used placebo interventions more than ten times, within the last year. Hospital-based doctors and private specialists reported to have used placebo interventions less frequently (p < .001). The most important reason for the use of placebo interventions was to avoid a confrontation with the patient. Typical placebos were antibiotics for viral infections. Approximately 30% (28-36) of the clinicians believed in an effect of placebo interventions on objective outcomes, and 46% (42-50) found clinical placebo interventions generally ethically acceptable.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: Over the past century, a major shift in North American food practices has been taking place. However, the literature on this topic is lacking in several areas. Some available research on food and cooking practices in the current context is presented, with a focus on how these are affecting health and how they might be contributing to health inequalities within the population. First, cooking and cooking skills are examined, along with the ambiguities related to terms associated with cooking in the research literature. Food choice, cooking, and health are described, particularly in relation to economic factors that may lead to health inequalities within the population. The importance of developing an understanding of factors within the wider food system as part of food choice and cooking skills is presented, and gaps in the research literature are examined and areas for future research are presented. Cooking practices are not well studied but are important to an understanding of human nutritional health as it relates to cultural, environmental, and economic factors.\n",
  "thought_process": "As I delve into the query \"How Doctors Responded to Being Named a Leading Killer,\" my initial impressions are that this is a metaphorical question, pointing towards systemic issues or medical errors within the healthcare system that significantly contribute to mortality. It evokes thoughts of iatrogenic harm, medical malpractice, and the overall safety of patients in healthcare settings. The query seems to be seeking an understanding of how medical professionals have reacted to the realization that their practices or the systems they work within can cause harm, and potentially, how they are working to address these issues.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the current search results do not align well with the query's intent. The text snippets provided from documents at various positions (k=1, k=2, k=10) touch on aspects of healthcare and patient behavior but do not directly address the query's focus on doctors' responses to being associated with high mortality rates. This discrepancy suggests that the original query may not be effectively capturing the desired information, indicating a need for query expansion.\n\nTo approach this systematically, I will utilize the multi-disciplinary expert panel technique. This involves convening a hypothetical panel of experts from diverse fields related to the query, such as patient safety, public health, medical ethics, medical history, and sociology. Each expert would analyze the query from their unique perspective, identifying key concepts, methodologies, and specialized vocabulary that could enrich the search.\n\nThe expert panel would include individuals like Dr. Anya Sharma, a patient safety expert, who could focus on adverse events and system failures within healthcare; Dr. Ben Carter, a public health policy analyst, who could analyze public perception and the impact of health campaigns; Dr. Chloe Davis, a medical ethicist and historian, who could investigate historical instances of harmful medical practices and ethical debates; Dr. David Evans, a medical sociologist, who could examine social determinants of health and disparities in access to care; and Dr. Emily Foster, a healthcare communication strategist, who could study communication strategies used by healthcare organizations in response to criticism.\n\nThrough individual consultations and a panel discussion, these experts would identify cross-disciplinary connections, highlight complementary tools and frameworks, and clarify terminology differences between fields. They would provide recommendations for valuable resources, domain-specific search terms, and concepts to explore further.\n\nAs I synthesize the insights from the expert panel, I notice that terms like \"iatrogenic harm,\" \"medical errors,\" \"patient safety,\" \"adverse events,\" \"system failure,\" and \"medical malpractice\" emerge as crucial. The experts' contributions also underscore the importance of understanding public health crises, the role of communication in shaping public perception, historical parallels to current challenges, social inequalities influencing health outcomes, and systemic factors contributing to medical errors.\n\nBy systematically applying the multi-disciplinary expert panel technique and interspersing it with natural thought patterns\u2014such as considering occasional false starts, making intuitive connections, and taking brief tangents\u2014I find that the expanded query begins to take shape. Insights emerge from both the structured approach and intuitive leaps, leading to a comprehensive understanding of what the user might be seeking.\n\nThe process of applying the technique and exploring related threads leads me to believe that terms such as \"iatrogenic harm,\" \"medical errors,\" \"patient safety,\" \"adverse events,\" \"system failure,\" \"malpractice,\" \"defensive medicine,\" and \"healthcare-associated infections\" would be most effective for a BM25 index. These terms capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of the user's query, aiming to provide a more aligned and informative search result.\n\nThrough this structured yet intuitively informed process, I have generated an expanded query that balances the need for systematic approach with the flexibility of natural cognitive patterns, aiming to enhance the retrieval of relevant information on how doctors have responded to being named a leading killer.",
