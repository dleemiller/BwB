Ad-36 prevalence is 30% in obese adults, but prevalence has not been reported in childhood obesity. OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of Ad-36 infection in obese Korean children (age 14.8 +/- 1.9; range 8.3-6.3 years); correlation of infection with BMI z-score and other obesity measures. METHODS: Blood was drawn at the annual school physical exam or clinic visit; Ad-36 status was determined by serum neutralization assay; and routine serum chemistry values. RESULTS: A total of 30% of subjects were positive (N = 25) for Ad-36; 70% were negative (N = 59). Significantly higher BMI z-scores (1.92 vs. 1.65, p < 0.01) and waist circumferences (96.3 vs. 90.7 cm, p = 0.05) were found in infected versus uninfected children. Cardiovascular risk factors were not significantly different. CONCLUSIONS: Ad-36 infection is common in obese Korean children and correlates highly with obesity. Ad-36 may have played a role in the obesity and Type 2 diabetes epidemic in children.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: The most important factors leading to fat accumulation in children are genetic inheritance, endocrine alterations, and behavioural/environmental causes. In addition, experimental animal studies have shown that infections due to various pathogens can lead to overweight and obesity conditions, and studies of humans have found that the incidence of seroconversion against some of these may be significantly more frequent in obese adults and children than in normal subjects. However, the results of these studies are not conclusive and, in some cases, have raised more questions than answers. We reviewed the literature concerning the role of adenovirus 36 (AD-36), the most widely studied infectious agent in animals and humans, because of its potential association with childhood obesity. The available evidence suggests that more studies are needed to evaluate whether or not the association between the presence of AD-36 antibodies and obesity is simply unrelated, and to verify whether there are subjects that have greater tendency to become obese because more easily susceptible to AD-36 infection or with a predisposition to suffer from persistent viral infection more easily leading to the development of obesity. If it is demonstrated that AD-36 does play a role in obesity, it will be important to investigate possible vaccines against the infection itself or antiviral drugs capable of inhibiting disease progression.

Pooled analysis showed that the WMD for BMI of Ad36 infection compared with non-infection was 3.19 (95% CI 1.44\u20134.93; P<0.001). Sensitivity analysis restricted to studies of adults yielded a similar result of 3.18 (95% CI 0.78\u20135.57; P\u200a=\u200a0.009). The increased risk of obesity associated with Ad36 infection was also significant (OR: 1.9; 95% CI: 1.01\u20133.56; P\u200a=\u200a0.047). No significant differences were found in relation to total cholesterol (P\u200a=\u200a0.83), triglycerides (P\u200a=\u200a0.64), HDL (P\u200a=\u200a0.69), blood glucose (P\u200a=\u200a0.08), waist circumstance (P\u200a=\u200a0.09), and systolic blood pressure (P\u200a=\u200a0.25). Conclusion/Significance Ad36 infection was associated with the risk of obesity and weight gain, but was not associated with abnormal metabolic markers including waist circumstance. It suggests that Ad36 infection is more associated with accumulation of subcutaneous fat than that of visceral fat. The relationship between Ad36 and obesity should be assessed by further studies, including well-designed prospective studies, to gain a better understanding of whether Ad36 plays a role in the etiology of human obesity.\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"Infectobesity: Adenovirus 36 and Childhood Obesity\", this makes me think of the potential link between viral infections and obesity in children. The user might actually be trying to understand the scientific research exploring this correlation, its mechanisms, and potential implications. I notice that the existing results primarily focus on Ad-36, which leaves room for broader exploration of other viruses and obesity factors.\n\nUpon analyzing the results of the original query, I see that there are some strengths in the search terms, such as the specific mention of Adenovirus 36 and childhood obesity. However, there are also some weaknesses, like the lack of consideration for other viruses that might contribute to obesity. I think it would be beneficial to explore other factors, such as gastrointestinal infections, metabolic disorders, and hormonal influences on weight.\n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here, so let me approach this using the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal technique, which involves constructing a conceptual graph and traversing it to find high-value expansion terms. This should help because it allows me to systematically identify and explore relevant concepts and relationships.\n\nFollowing the technique's steps, I first identify the core concepts and entities in the original query, which are Adenovirus 36, childhood obesity, and infectobesity. Then, I determine the search intent, which appears to be informational, as the user is seeking to understand the relationship between these concepts.\n\nNext, I construct a conceptual graph with core nodes, first-order connections, second-order connections, and domain contexts. I see that Adenovirus 36 is connected to obesity, which is also linked to other factors like metabolic disorders and hormonal influences. I also notice that there are second-order connections to other viruses, such as rotavirus and norovirus, which could be relevant to the query.\n\nNow, I need to select promising directions for query expansion. I think synonymous terms, hierarchical terms, and compositional terms could be useful. For example, I could explore other terms related to Adenovirus 36, such as \"adenovirus infection\" or \"viral obesity\". I could also consider broader terms, like \"childhood metabolic disorders\" or \"gastrointestinal infections\".\n\nAs I traverse the graph, I extract high-value terms and filter them based on relevance, distinctiveness, specificity, and searchability. I find terms like \"viruses\", \"obesity mechanisms\", and \"gastrointestinal infections\" to be relevant and useful for expanding the query.\n\nWait, that's not quite right for this query. Let me adjust my approach. I realize that I need to consider the user's intent and the context of the query more carefully. I should focus on terms that are closely related to Adenovirus 36 and childhood obesity, rather than exploring too broadly.\n\nThis step of the technique is revealing some interesting insights, such as the potential link between Adenovirus 36 and obesity mechanisms. Which actually reminds me of the concept of hormonal influences on weight, that might also be relevant.\n\nI need to consider the next step in the technique, which is to evaluate the terms I've extracted and filter them based on their relevance and usefulness. But I'm also noticing this interesting pattern where gastrointestinal infections seem to be connected to obesity, which could be a valuable area to explore.\n\nApplying the specific aspect of the technique leads me to discover terms like \"adenovirus 36\" and \"childhood obesity\", which are directly related to the original query. I also find terms like \"viruses\" and \"obesity mechanisms\", which provide a broader context for understanding the relationship between Adenovirus 36 and childhood obesity.\n\nI just had a realization that connects to what we were exploring earlier - the idea that other viruses, like rotavirus and norovirus, could also contribute to obesity. This could be a valuable area to explore further.\n\nFollowing the technique pointed me toward the concept of Adenovirus 36, but my instinct says we should also consider other factors, like metabolic disorders and hormonal influences on weight. These factors could be closely related to the development of obesity in children and might provide a more comprehensive understanding of the issue.\n\nThrough this process of applying the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal technique and exploring related threads, I believe the terms \"adenovirus 36\", \"childhood obesity\", \"viruses\", \"obesity mechanisms\", and \"gastrointestinal infections\" would be most effective for a BM25 index. They capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, which is to understand the relationship between Adenovirus 36 and childhood obesity, as well as the potential mechanisms and factors involved.",
