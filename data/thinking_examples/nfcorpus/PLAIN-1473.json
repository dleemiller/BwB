  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: The importance of dietary sulforaphane in helping maintain good health continues to gain support within the health-care community and awareness among U.S. consumers. In addition to the traditional avenue for obtaining sulforaphane, namely, the consumption of appropriate cruciferous vegetables, other consumer products containing added glucoraphanin, the natural precursor to sulforaphane, are now appearing in the United States. Crucifer seeds are a likely source for obtaining glucoraphanin, owing to a higher concentration of glucoraphanin and the relative ease of processing seeds as compared to vegetative parts. Seeds of several commonly consumed crucifers were analyzed not only for glucoraphanin but also for components that might have negative health implications, such as certain indole-containing glucosinolates and erucic acid-containing lipids. Glucoraphanin, 4-hydroxyglucobrassicin, other glucosinolates, and lipid erucic acid were quantified in seeds of 33 commercially available cultivars of broccoli, 4 cultivars each of kohlrabi, radish, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, kale, and cabbage, and 2 cultivars of raab.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: The aims of this study were to determine the concentrations of 4-nonylphenol (NP) and 4-octylphenol (OP) in 59 human milk samples and to examine related factors including mothers' demographics and dietary habits. Women who consumed over the median amount of cooking oil had significantly higher OP concentrations (0.98 ng/g) than those who consumed less (0.39 ng/g) (P < 0.05). OP concentration was significantly associated with the consumption of cooking oil (beta = 0.62, P < 0.01) and fish oil capsules (beta = 0.39, P < 0.01) after adjustment for age and body mass index (BMI). NP concentration was also significantly associated with the consumption of fish oil capsules (beta = 0.38, P < 0.01) and processed fish products (beta = 0.59, P < 0.01). The food pattern of cooking oil and processed meat products from factor analysis was strongly associated with OP concentration in human milk (P < 0.05). These determinations should aid in suggesting foods for consumption by nursing mothers in order to protect their infants from NP/OP exposure. 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Mastalgia is resistant to treatment in 6% of cyclical and 26% non-cyclical patients. Surgery is not widely used to treat this condition and only considered in patients with severe mastalgia resistant to medication. The aims of this study were to audit the efficacy of surgery in severe treatment resistant mastalgia and to assess patient satisfaction following surgery. This is a retrospective review of the medical records of all patients seen in mastalgia clinic in the University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff since 1973. A postal questionnaire was distributed to all patients who had undergone surgery. Results showed that of the 1054 patients seen in mastalgia clinic, 12 (1.2%) had undergone surgery. Surgery included 8 subcutaneous mastectomies with implants (3 bilateral, 5 unilateral), 1 bilateral simple mastectomy and 3 quadrantectomies (1 having a further simple mastectomy). The median duration of symptoms was 6.5 years (range 2-16 years). Five patients (50%) were pain free following surgery, 3 developed capsular contractures and 2 wound infections with dehiscence. Pain persisted in both patients undergoing quadrantectomy. We conclude that surgery for mastalgia should only be considered in a minority of patients. Patients should be informed of possible complications inherent of reconstructive surgery and warned that in 50% cases their pain will not be improved.\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query \"kohlrabi\", this makes me think of a cruciferous vegetable, but the user might actually be trying to explore its specific uses, nutritional benefits, or even medicinal properties. The term itself is quite narrow, so I expect the user is seeking more detailed information beyond just its classification.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the top documents discuss sulforaphane, glucoraphanin, and other glucosinolates, which are indeed relevant to kohlrabi. However, these terms are also associated with other cruciferous vegetables, so the search might be too broad. The ineffective terms, such as \"cruciferous vegetables\", should be avoided to narrow down the search.\n\nTo expand the query, I'll apply the expansion technique, which involves identifying specific, diverse, and relevant terms. I'll start by examining the goals and gaps in the original query, then identify ineffective terms, followed by breadth expansion and depth expansion.\n\nThe breadth expansion led to terms like \"Brassicaceae family\", \"garden crops\", \"alkaloids\", \"phytonutrients\", and \"culinary herbs\", which provide a good starting point. However, to add more depth, I'll focus on one of these terms, such as \"phytonutrients\", and explore related concepts like \"glucosinolates\", \"isthiocyanates\", \"sulforaphane analogs\", and \"antioxidant activity\".\n\nAs I apply the expansion technique, I notice that the terms are becoming more specific and targeted. The depth expansion reveals a wealth of information on the nutritional and medicinal properties of kohlrabi, which is exactly what the user might be looking for.\n\nOccasionally, I consider false starts or reconsiderations, such as exploring the culinary uses of kohlrabi, but then I realize that the user might be more interested in its health benefits. I also make intuitive connections between the terms, such as the relationship between glucosinolates and sulforaphane analogs.\n\nThrough this process, insights emerge from both the structured approach and my natural thought patterns. I realize that the user is likely seeking information on the unique nutritional constituents of kohlrabi, its potential medicinal properties, and how it relates to other vegetables in the Brassicaceae family.\n\nBy synthesizing the information, I believe the expanded query should include terms like \"Brassicaceae glucosinolates isthiocyanates sulforaphane analogs antioxidant activity\". These terms capture the essence of what the user is seeking, while avoiding ineffective words and targeting non-overlapping results from the original query.",
