  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: Lisa Perez Jackson ( born February 8 , 1962 ) is an American chemical engineer who served as the Administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) from 2009 to 2013 . In May 2013 , it was announced that Jackson would be joining Apple Inc. as their environmental director .   Born in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , Jackson is a graduate of Tulane University and Princeton University . She began working as a staff-level engineer for the Environmental Protection Agency in 1987 ; later moving to the EPA 's regional office in New York City , where she spent the majority of her 16-year EPA career . She joined the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection in 2002 , working as the assistant commissioner of compliance and enforcement and as the assistant commissioner for land use management . ...\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n... State Department offered a nation-level perspective in the Fourth US Climate Action Report ( USCAR ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change , including measures to address climate change . The report showed that the country was on track to achieve President Bush 's goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions per unit of gross domestic product ) by 18 percent from 2002 to 2012 . Over that same period , actual GHG emissions were projected to increase by 11 percent . The report estimated that in 2006 , U.S. GHG emissions decreased 1.5 percent from 2005 to 7,075.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent . This was an increase of 15.1 percent from the 1990 levels of 6,146.7 million tonnes ( or 0.9 percent annual increase ) , and an increase of 1.4 percent from the 2000 levels of 6,978.4 million tonnes . By 2012 GHG emissions were projected to increase to more than 7,709 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent , which would be 26 percent above 1990 levels .\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: Mongstad Power Station is a natural gas-fired thermal power plant under construction at the industrial site of Mongstad in Norway .   The station is owned by a consortium of Statoil and DONG Energy , and will be operated by the latter . Construction costs are estimated at NOK 4 billion .  The power station will have an installed effect of 280 MW in electricity production and 350 MW in heat . The energy will be used to operate the Mongstad Refinery as well to supply the Troll Gas Field with power . The plant will use 0.7 billion normal cubic meter ( BCM ) of gas per year . Emissions of carbon dioxide will be 1.2 million tonnes .   The power station has been subject to controversy in Norway , based upon the potential increase in emission of greenhouse gases . Statoil has entered into an implementation agreement in cooperation with Gassnova which representing the Norwegian government in matters relating to Carbon capture and storage , to develop solutions for carbon dioxide capture at Mongstad . Early in 2009 , Statoil delivered a master plan for full scale CO2 capture at Mongstad .\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"The EPA director under Obama said the Clean Power Initiative would have no effect on man-made CO2 emissions,\" this makes me think of the complexities of environmental policy and the varying opinions on its effectiveness. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the implications of the Clean Power Initiative on climate change, I'm not sure yet what specific aspects they're interested in. Are they looking for the scientific basis of the initiative, its implementation challenges, or perhaps the political discourse surrounding it?\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the top documents discuss the EPA director's background, national climate action reports, and even a specific power station's emissions. This tells me that the search terms might be too broad or not precisely targeted at the user's intent. The strengths of these search terms lie in their ability to fetch relevant information about the EPA and climate change, but their weaknesses are in the lack of specificity regarding the Clean Power Initiative's impact on CO2 emissions.\n\nTo better understand and expand this query, I'll approach it using the \"Query Expansion via User Intent and Journey Mapping\" technique. This involves creating user personas, analyzing their search vocabulary, mapping their information journey, identifying contextual scenarios, and extracting intent-based terms. By doing so, we can capture a wider range of user intents and create a more comprehensive search query.\n\nLet's start by creating user personas. We have the \"Concerned Citizen\" who is a novice and might be searching for basic information on climate change and the Clean Power Initiative. Then there's the \"Policy Student\" at an intermediate level, looking for more in-depth information on how the initiative aims to reduce CO2 emissions. The \"Environmental Scientist\" is advanced and interested in the scientific arguments for and against the initiative's effectiveness. Finally, we have the \"Energy Policy Analyst\" as an expert, seeking detailed analyses of the initiative's impact on energy markets and climate policy.\n\nAs I apply the technique's steps systematically, I also notice some interesting patterns and tangents. For instance, the concept of carbon capture and storage comes up, which is a crucial aspect of reducing CO2 emissions but might not be directly related to the Clean Power Initiative. However, it could be an important consideration for users interested in comprehensive climate change mitigation strategies.\n\nThrough this process, insights begin to emerge from both the structured approach and my intuition. Applying the user intent and journey mapping technique leads me to discover terms like \"climate action,\" \"EPA regulations,\" \"clean energy policies,\" and \"greenhouse gas emissions,\" which are crucial for capturing the user's search intent. My instinct also suggests considering terms related to the policy's effectiveness, such as \"policy analysis\" and \"regulatory impact,\" as these would be important for users seeking a deeper understanding of the Clean Power Initiative.\n\nAs I synthesize the information, I believe the terms that would be most effective for a search query, especially in the context of a BM25 index, are those that capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking. The expanded query, \"Clean Power Initiative CO2 emissions Obama EPA director statement policy analysis effectiveness climate change regulations,\" seems to encompass a broad spectrum of user intents and information needs. It combines the core elements of the original query with additional terms that reflect the diverse perspectives and knowledge levels of potential users.\n\nThrough this thought process, it becomes clear that expanding a search query effectively requires a balance between structured techniques and natural cognitive patterns. By systematically applying the query expansion technique while remaining open to intuitive connections and occasional tangents, we can develop a search query that is both comprehensive and targeted, thereby enhancing the user's search experience and retrieval outcomes.",
