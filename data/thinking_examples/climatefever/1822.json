Electricity demand had been falling and in 2012 was at the lowest level seen since 2006 in the National Electricity Market .\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n... However , some economists argue that caps prevent non-price policies , such as renewable energy subsidies , from reducing carbon emissions , while carbon taxes do not . Others argue that an enforced cap is the only way to guarantee that carbon emissions will actually be reduced ; a carbon tax will not prevent those who can afford to do so from continuing to generate emissions .   The choice of pricing approach , a tax or cap-and-trade , has been controversial . A carbon tax is generally favored on economic grounds for its simplicity and stability , while cap-and-trade is often favored on political grounds . Recently ( 2013 \u2212 14 ) economic opinion has been shifting more heavily toward taxes as national policy measures , and toward a neutral carbon-price-commitment position for the purpose of international climate negotiations .\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n...

Over that same period , actual GHG emissions were projected to increase by 11 percent . The report estimated that in 2006 , U.S. GHG emissions decreased 1.5 percent from 2005 to 7,075.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent . This was an increase of 15.1 percent from the 1990 levels of 6,146.7 million tonnes ( or 0.9 percent annual increase ) , and an increase of 1.4 percent from the 2000 levels of 6,978.4 million tonnes . By 2012 GHG emissions were projected to increase to more than 7,709 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent , which would be 26 percent above 1990 levels .\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query \"Trudeau's carbon tax will raise gas prices by 11 cents/litre,\" this makes me think of the economic and environmental implications of such a policy. The user might actually be trying to understand the impact of carbon taxation on gas prices, but also potentially the broader effects on the economy and the environment. Hmm, not sure yet, but it seems like we're dealing with a complex issue that involves multiple factors.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the top documents discuss the economic aspects of carbon taxation, the comparison between carbon taxes and cap-and-trade systems, and the impact of climate change policies on greenhouse gas emissions. The strengths of these search terms lie in their ability to retrieve documents that discuss the economic and environmental implications of carbon taxation. However, the weaknesses are that they might not capture the specific context of Trudeau's policies or the Canadian perspective on carbon taxation.\n\nLet me approach this using the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal technique, which involves constructing a conceptual graph with core nodes, first-order connections, second-order connections, and domain contexts. This should help because it will allow me to systematically explore the relationships between the original query terms and identify relevant expansion terms.\n\nFollowing the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal approach, I should first identify the core concepts and entities in the original query. These are \"Trudeau,\" \"carbon tax,\" and \"gas prices.\" The search intent is informational, and there are implicit assumptions about the impact of carbon taxation on the economy and the environment.\n\nNext, I need to construct the conceptual graph. The core nodes are \"Trudeau,\" \"carbon tax,\" and \"gas prices.\" The first-order connections include the relationships between these nodes, such as the impact of carbon tax on gas prices. The second-order connections involve related concepts like climate change, emissions reduction, and energy policy. The domain contexts include the fields of economics, politics, and environmental science.\n\nNow, I need to select promising expansion paths. These could include synonymous terms, hierarchical terms, compositional terms, contextual terms, and domain-specific terminology. For example, synonymous terms for \"carbon tax\" could include \"carbon pricing\" or \"emissions tax.\" Hierarchical terms might include broader concepts like \"environmental policy\" or narrower concepts like \"fuel tax.\"\n\nAs I apply the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal technique, I'm noticing that the expansion paths are revealing interesting connections between the original query terms and related concepts. For instance, the concept of \"climate change\" is closely related to \"carbon tax\" and \"emissions reduction.\" This reminds me of the importance of considering the environmental impact of economic policies.\n\nI'm also seeing that the technique is helping me to identify high-value expansion terms that are relevant to the original query. These include terms like \"energy policy,\" \"environmental policies,\" and \"taxation.\" These terms are distinctive, specific, and searchable, making them useful for improving document retrieval.\n\nThrough this process of applying the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal technique and exploring related threads, I believe the expanded terms will be most effective for a BM25 index. These terms capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, including the economic, environmental, and political implications of Trudeau's carbon tax policy.\n\nThe final expanded query is \"Trudeau carbon tax gas prices climate change emissions reduction energy policy environmental policies taxation.\" This augmented query maintains the original search intent while providing valuable alternative pathways for retrieval.",
