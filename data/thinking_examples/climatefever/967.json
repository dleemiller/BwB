  "reasoning": "The query examines the historical occurrence of warming-cooling cycles since 900AD, highlighting the need to identify climatic patterns over this time span. The available documents provide context on significant climate changes but do not specifically address frequent short-term cycles. To enrich our understanding and formulate an augmented query, we must trace back through known climatic events, recognize milestones that align with warming-cooling trends, and consider emerging research areas. This process involves leveraging historical data, recognizing key developments in climate science, and identifying contemporary terminologies used to describe similar phenomena.",

  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: Termination , as used by Quaternary geologists , oceanographers , and paleoclimatologists is the period of time during an glacial cycle when there is a relatively rapid transition from full glacial climates to full interglacial climates . For the Quaternary period , terminations are numbered using Roman numerals from the most recent termination as `` I '' and with increasing value , e.g. `` II '' , `` III '' , and so forth , into the past . Termination I , also known as the Last Glacial Termination , is the end of Marine isotope stage 2 ; Termination II is the end of Marine Isotope Stage 6 ; Termination III is the end of Marine Isotope Stage 8 ; Termination IV is the end of Marine Isotope Stage 10 , and so forth .   During the Quaternary , global climate experienced a recurring pattern of ice-sheet growth and decay . The length of Late Quaternary cycles varied between 80,000 and 120,000 years , with an average recurrence interval of about 100,000 years . ...\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n... Pielou . With the close of the `` Little Ice Age '' ( mid-14th to late 19th centuries ) , neoglaciation appears to have been stalled in the late 20th century , assumed to be caused by anthropogenic global warming . Whether it has been temporarily or semi-permanently stalled , neoglaciation has been marked by a retreat from the warm conditions of the Climatic Optimum and the advance or reformation of glaciers that had not existed since the last ice age . In the mountains of western North America , montane glaciers that had completely melted reformed shortly before 5000 BP . The most severe part of the best documented neoglacial period , especially in Europe and the North Atlantic , is termed the `` Little Ice Age '' .   In North America , neoglaciation had ecological effects in the spread of muskeg on flat , poorly drained land , such as the bed of recently drained Lake Agassiz and in the Hudson Bay lowlands , in the retreat of grassland before an advancing forest border in the Great Plains , and in shifting ranges of forest trees and diagnostic plant species ( identified through palynology ) .   The view that neoglaciation is ending in present times , is assumed by those who identify the most recent climate changes and global warming as the onset of a new period in Earth history , speculatively calling it the `` Early anthropocene '' , as a coming geological age dominated by the effects of Homo sapiens .\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n... A major goal of the project is to significantly improve the understanding of Antarctica 's impact on the world 's oceans currents and the atmosphere by reconstructing the behavior of Antarctic sea-ice , ice-shelves , glaciers and sea currents over tens of millions of years . Initial results imply rapid changes and dramatically different climates at various times on the southernmost continent.Quirin Scheirmeier , `` Sediment cores reveal Antarctica 's warmer past , '' Nature News , April 24 , 2008 .   The $ 30 million project has achieved its operational goal of retrieving a continuous core record of the last 17 million years , filling crucial gaps left by previous drilling projects . Making use of knowledge gained through prior Antarctic drilling projects , ANDRILL employed novel techniques to reach record depths at its two drilling sites . ...\n",
  "thought_process": "As I delve into the query about warming-cooling cycles since 900AD, my initial impression is that this topic is deeply rooted in historical climate patterns. The user's statement about five warming cycles followed by dramatic cooling cycles sparks my curiosity, making me wonder about the underlying factors that contribute to these cycles. I think about the Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age, two significant climate events that have been well-documented in historical records. However, I also consider the possibility that the user might be looking for more nuanced information, perhaps related to the solar influence on climate patterns or the early Anthropocene climatic impacts.\n\nAnalyzing the results from the original query, I notice that the top documents provide valuable insights into climate change, but they don't explicitly address the short-term cycles mentioned in the query. This realization prompts me to think about how I can expand the query to capture more relevant information. I begin to consider the historical foundation of the topic, tracing back to the early developments in paleoclimatology and the establishment of key concepts like radiocarbon dating.\n\nAs I transition to a more structured approach, I decide to utilize the Temporal Evolution Analysis technique. This involves breaking down the topic's evolution into distinct time periods, from its historical origins to its current state and potential future developments. I think about the developmental milestones in the field of climatology, such as the discovery of solar cycles and the integration of machine learning algorithms in predicting climate variations.\n\nApplying the Temporal Evolution Analysis technique, I systematically analyze the topic's evolution, identifying key terms and concepts that have emerged over time. I start with the historical foundation, noting the importance of the Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age. I then move on to the developmental milestones, recognizing the significance of paleoclimatology and radiocarbon dating. As I assess the current landscape, I identify contemporary approaches like satellite data analysis and climate modeling.\n\nThroughout this process, I find myself making intuitive connections between different concepts and techniques. For instance, I realize that the solar influence on climate patterns is closely related to the early Anthropocene climatic impacts. I also notice that the use of machine learning algorithms in predicting climate variations is an area of emerging research.\n\nAs I synthesize my thoughts, I begin to see a clearer picture of the topic's evolution and the key terms that can help expand the query. I think about the temporal terms that have emerged, such as \"Medieval Warm Period,\" \"Little Ice Age,\" \"paleoclimatology,\" and \"radiocarbon dating.\" I also consider the current landscape and emerging trends, recognizing the importance of satellite data, machine learning algorithms, and high-resolution paleoclimate datasets.\n\nThrough this process, I come to believe that the expanded query should incorporate a range of temporal terms, from historical events to contemporary approaches and emerging trends. I think that the final expanded query should look like this: \"warming cooling cycles since 900ad medieval warm period little ice age solar influence climate patterns early anthropocene climatic impacts radiocarbon dating historical climates.\" This query captures the full temporal spectrum of the topic, from its historical foundations to its current state and potential future developments.",
