These first , ancient bacteria added to the methane concentration by converting hydrogen and carbon dioxide into methane and water . Oxygen did not become a major part of the atmosphere until photosynthetic organisms evolved later in Earth 's history . With no oxygen , methane stayed in the atmosphere longer and at higher concentrations than it does today .   Methane is created near the surface , and it is carried into the stratosphere by rising air in the tropics . Uncontrolled build-up of methane in Earth 's atmosphere is naturally checked -- although human influence can upset this natural regulation -- by methane 's reaction with hydroxyl radicals formed from singlet oxygen atoms and with water vapor .\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: The First Assessment Report ( FAR ) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) was completed in 1990 . It served as the basis of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( UNFCCC ) .   The report was issued in three main sections , corresponding to the three Working Groups of scientists that the IPCC had established .   Working Group I : Scientific Assessment of Climate Change , edited by J.T. Houghton , G.J. Jenkins and J.J. Ephraums  Working Group II : Impacts Assessment of Climate Change , edited by W.J. McG .

This format was followed in subsequent Assessment Reports .   The executive summary of the policymakers ' summary of the WG I report includes :   We are certain of the following : there is a natural greenhouse effect ... ; emissions resulting from human activities are substantially increasing the atmospheric concentrations of the greenhouse gases : CO2 , methane , CFCs and nitrous oxide . These increases will enhance the greenhouse effect , resulting on average in an additional warming of the Earth 's surface . The main greenhouse gas , water vapour , will increase in response to global warming and further enhance it .

  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"Therefore human emissions upset the natural balance, rising CO2 to levels not seen in at least 800,000 years,\" this makes me think of the complex interplay between human activities and the environment. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the mechanisms behind CO2 imbalance and potential strategies for mitigation, it seems there's a broader curiosity about how human emissions have historically and currently impacted the planet's carbon cycle. The mention of 800,000 years immediately draws my attention to the geological and paleoclimatic contexts, suggesting the user is interested in a deep, historical perspective on CO2 levels.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, it's clear that the strengths lie in highlighting the critical issue of human emissions and their impact on CO2 levels. However, the initial query might not fully capture the nuances of the topic, such as the role of industrial activities, the effectiveness of mitigation strategies, or the importance of individual actions in reducing carbon footprints. The weaknesses include a lack of specificity regarding the types of human emissions, the scientific evidence supporting the 800,000-year claim, and the practical steps individuals and communities can take.\n\nTransitioning to a structured approach, I'll use the \"Query Expansion Through Journalistic Investigation\" technique. This involves treating the query as a story that needs comprehensive research and investigation to uncover all relevant angles and terms. The technique includes assessing the query's underlying needs, identifying real-world contexts, investigating authoritative sources, creating diverse headlines, and extracting valuable terms.\n\nApplying the first step of the technique, query assessment, it becomes apparent that the user is seeking more than just factual information about CO2 levels. There's an implicit request for understanding the human impact on the environment, the science behind CO2 increase, and perhaps ways to address this issue. The assumption here is that the user values a comprehensive view, including historical, scientific, and practical aspects.\n\nMoving to real-world contexts, this query is relevant in professional settings like environmental science and policy-making, educational contexts such as climate change courses, personal situations where individuals want to reduce their carbon footprint, and specialized communities like renewable energy enthusiasts. Historical contexts, such as the Industrial Revolution, and evolving contexts, like advancements in climate science and international agreements, are also crucial.\n\nThe resource investigation step involves looking into notable experts in climate science, established methodologies for reducing emissions, essential terminology like \"anthropogenic emissions\" and \"mitigation strategies,\" and organizations involved in environmental protection. Creating headlines for articles that could address the query from different angles helps to further refine the search terms. For instance, \"Understanding Earth's Ancient CO2 Levels,\" \"Effective Strategies for Reducing Personal Carbon Footprints,\" and \"The Impact of Industrial Activities on Natural Carbon Cycles\" suggest a range of relevant topics and terms.\n\nExtracting terms from these headlines and considering the broader context of the query, we find valuable search terms like \"800,000 years CO2 levels,\" \"anthropogenic emissions sources,\" \"mitigation strategies effectiveness,\" \"individual carbon footprint reduction,\" and \"historical atmospheric data.\" These terms, combined with the original query intent, form a comprehensive augmented query that can uncover a wide range of relevant information on the topic.\n\nThrough this process of applying the \"Query Expansion Through Journalistic Investigation\" technique and exploring related threads, I believe the terms from the augmented query\u2014such as \"800,000 years CO2 levels,\" \"anthropogenic emissions,\" \"mitigation strategies,\" \"individual carbon footprint,\" \"historical atmospheric data,\" \"industrial revolution,\" and \"renewable energy\"\u2014would be most effective for exploring the topic of human emissions and their impact on CO2 levels. These terms capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, providing a robust foundation for further research and understanding.",
