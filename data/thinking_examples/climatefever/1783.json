  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n... This climate pattern also affects coastal sea and continental surface air temperatures from Alaska to California .   During a `` warm '' , or `` positive '' , phase , the west Pacific becomes cooler and part of the eastern ocean warms ; during a `` cool '' or `` negative '' phase , the opposite pattern occurs . The Pacific Decadal Oscillation was named by Steven R. Hare , who noticed it while studying salmon production pattern results in 1997 .   The Pacific Decadal Oscillation index is the leading empirical orthogonal function ( EOF ) of monthly sea surface temperature anomalies ( SST-A ) over the North Pacific ( poleward of 20 \u00b0 N ) after the global average sea surface temperature has been removed . This PDO index is the standardized principal component time series . A PDO ` signal ' has been reconstructed to 1661 through tree-ring chronologies in the Baja California area .\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n... There was increased public interest in 2013 in the run-up to publication of the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report , and despite concerns that a 15-year period was too short to determine a meaningful trend , the IPCC included a section on a hiatus , which it defined as a much smaller increasing linear trend over the 15 years from 1998 to 2012 , than over the 60 years from 1951 to 2012 . Various studies examined possible causes of the short-term slowdown . Even though the overall climate system has continued to accumulate energy due to Earth 's positive energy budget , the available temperature readings at the Earth 's surface indicate slower rates of increase in surface warming than in the prior decade . Since measurements at the top of the atmosphere show that Earth is receiving more energy than it is radiating back into space , the retained energy should be producing warming in the Earth 's climate system .   Research reported in July 2015 on an updated NOAA dataset casts doubt on the existence of a hiatus , and it finds no indication of a slowdown even in earlier years . ...\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n... Examples include variability in ocean basins such as the Pacific decadal oscillation and Atlantic multidecadal oscillation. Climate variability can also result from external forcing, when events outside of the climate system\\'s components nonetheless produce changes within the system. Examples include changes in solar output and volcanism.\\nClimate variability has consequences for sea level changes, plant life, and mass extinctions; it also affects human societies.\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query about internal variability and its role in global warming, this makes me think of the complexity of climate systems and how various factors contribute to warming and cooling trends. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the limitations of attributing recent warming solely to internal factors, it seems like they're hinting at the need to explore other contributing causes, such as external forcing mechanisms or anthropogenic influences.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, it's clear that the terms \"can only account for\" and \"small amounts\" are quite broad and non-precise, which could lead to ineffective search results. The text snippets from the initial results provide insights into climate patterns like the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, the concept of a hiatus in global warming, and the impact of external forcing on climate variability. These snippets suggest that the original query could benefit from more targeted and diverse terms to uncover relevant documents across various domains.\n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here, but to approach this systematically, I'll use the expansion technique provided, which involves being specific and diverse, applying varied augmentation techniques such as synonym replacement, conceptual expansion, and domain-specific terminology. This should help because it allows for a nuanced exploration of the topic, capturing both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking.\n\nFollowing this approach, the first step is to elucidate the query's goals and gaps. The primary objective is to understand the limitations of internal variability in explaining recent warming, with a gap in exploring alternative explanations. The ineffective terms identified are \"can only account for\" and \"small amounts,\" which are too broad and should be avoided.\n\nFor breadth expansion, candidate terms with increasingly distant concepts to the original query include ocean currents, solar cycles, volcanic activity, aerosols, and greenhouse gases. These terms introduce new dimensions to the query, targeting non-overlapping results from the original.\n\nChoosing one distant but important topic from the breadth expansion, such as ocean currents, and going deeper into related terms, we find concepts like climate models, forcing mechanisms, anthropogenic influence, carbon emissions, and IPCC reports. These terms are not only relevant but also targeted, primarily focusing on depth expansion with additional high-relevance terms.\n\nApplying the technique systematically and interspersing it with natural cognitive elements, I notice that the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, mentioned in one of the text snippets, relates to ocean currents and could be a valuable addition to the expanded query. However, to maintain uniqueness and diversity, it's essential to focus on terms that are contextually or peripherally relevant to the original query without duplicating concepts.\n\nThrough this process of applying the expansion technique and exploring related threads, I believe the terms that would be most effective for a BM25 index are those that capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, such as climate models, forcing mechanisms, anthropogenic influence, carbon emissions, IPCC reports, and ocean currents. These terms emerge logically from both the technique and natural insights, ensuring a novel and relevant augmented query.\n\nThe final thought is that the augmented query should indeed reflect a balance between structured technique and natural cognitive patterns, leading to a more effective search strategy that uncovers relevant documents across various domains.",
