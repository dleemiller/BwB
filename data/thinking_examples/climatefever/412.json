  "reasoning": "The query seeks to link a specific warming period (1970-1998) with the emergence of the global warming alarmist movement. The current results fall short by not making this explicit link. To address this gap, we'll create user personas with varying levels of understanding of climate science and motivations for researching this period. We'll then map their potential search terms and information needs across their learning journey, considering different usage scenarios and intents. Finally, we'll extract key terms to augment the query, aiming to surface content that directly connects the warming period with the rise of climate change awareness or activism, and specifically whether the warming trend was a catalyst.",

  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n... There was increased public interest in 2013 in the run-up to publication of the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report , and despite concerns that a 15-year period was too short to determine a meaningful trend , the IPCC included a section on a hiatus , which it defined as a much smaller increasing linear trend over the 15 years from 1998 to 2012 , than over the 60 years from 1951 to 2012 . Various studies examined possible causes of the short-term slowdown . Even though the overall climate system has continued to accumulate energy due to Earth 's positive energy budget , the available temperature readings at the Earth 's surface indicate slower rates of increase in surface warming than in the prior decade . Since measurements at the top of the atmosphere show that Earth is receiving more energy than it is radiating back into space , the retained energy should be producing warming in the Earth 's climate system .   Research reported in July 2015 on an updated NOAA dataset casts doubt on the existence of a hiatus , and it finds no indication of a slowdown even in earlier years . ...\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: The Deniers is a 2008 book by Lawrence Solomon , a Canadian environmentalist and writer . Subtitled `` The world-renowned scientists who stood up against global warming hysteria , political persecution , and fraud , '' the book draws attention to a number of scientists and others who , according to Solomon , have advanced arguments against what he calls the `` alarmist '' view of global warming , as presented by Al Gore , the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , the mainstream media , and others . The book is based on a series of columns Solomon wrote for Canada 's National Post .\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: The rate of global mean sea-level rise ( ~ 3 mm/yr ; SLR ) has accelerated compared to the mean of the 20th century ( ~ 2 mm/yr ) , but the rate of rise is locally variable . Factors contributing to SLR include decreased global ice volume and warming of the ocean . On Greenland , the deficiency between annual ice gained and lost tripled between 1996 and 2007 . On Antarctica the deficiency increased by 75 % . Mountain glaciers are retreating and the cumulative mean thickness change has accelerated from about \u2212 1.8 to \u2212 4 m in 1965 to 1970 to about \u2212 12 to \u2212 14 m in the first decade of the 21st century . From 1961 to 2003 , ocean temperatures to a depth of 700 m increased and portions of the deeper ocean are warming .   The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( 2007 ) projected sea level would reach 0.18 to 0.59 m above present by the end of the 21st century but lacked an estimate of ice flow dynamics calving . Calving was added by Pfeffer et al. ( 2008 ) indicating 0.8 to 2 m of SLR by 2100 ( favouring the low end of this range ) . Rahmstorf ( 2007 ) estimated SLR will reach 0.5 to 1.4 m by the end of the century . Pielke ( 2008 ) points out that observed SLR has exceeded the best case projections thus far . These approximations and others indicate that global mean SLR may reach 1 m by the end of this century . However , sea level is highly variable and planners considering local impacts must take this variability into account .\n",
  "thought_process": "As I begin to expand the query related to the 1970-1998 warming period and its connection to the global warming alarmist movement, my initial thoughts revolve around understanding the context and motivations behind the original query. It seems the user is interested in exploring how a specific warming period influenced the emergence of global warming as a significant concern. The existing reasoning provided highlights the need to connect the dots between this warming period and the rise of climate change awareness or activism, essentially seeking to understand if the warming trend was a catalyst for the movement.\n\nMy first step is to analyze the results of the original query to identify strengths and weaknesses of the search terms. The text snippets from documents at various positions (k=1, k=2, k=10) provide insights into how different sources discuss global warming, its implications, and the scientific consensus around it. For instance, the snippet at k=1 discusses the concept of a hiatus in global warming, while the snippet at k=2 introduces the idea of \"deniers\" and the political aspect of the global warming debate. The snippet at k=10 delves into the specifics of sea-level rise and its projections. These snippets suggest that the discussion around global warming is multifaceted, involving scientific, political, and social dimensions.\n\nTo systematically approach the query expansion, I will utilize the technique of user intent and journey mapping. This involves creating user personas with varying levels of expertise and motivations for seeking information on the 1970-1998 warming period. By mapping their information needs across their learning journey, I can identify key terms and concepts that would be relevant at different stages of their search.\n\nThe user personas created include a climate science novice, a climate policy analyst, a climate change skeptic, and an environmental historian. Each persona has distinct goals, prior knowledge, and vocabulary differences that influence their search terms and information needs. For example, a novice might start with basic terms like \"climate change\" and \"global warming,\" while an expert might use more specialized terms like \"anthropogenic climate change\" and \"hockey stick graph.\"\n\nAs I apply the user intent and journey mapping technique, I notice that the search vocabulary and intent terms extracted can significantly enhance the query. Terms like \"origins,\" \"rise,\" \"catalyst,\" \"alarmism,\" and \"scientific basis\" reflect the diverse intents and information needs of the user personas. Incorporating these terms into the query can help surface content that directly addresses the connection between the 1970-1998 warming period and the emergence of the global warming alarmist movement.\n\nThe journey stages and usage scenarios further refine the query expansion process. By considering how users progress from basic understanding to advanced knowledge and how they apply this information in different contexts (e.g., writing a blog post, developing a curriculum, preparing a presentation), I can ensure that the expanded query captures the complexity and nuance of the user's information needs.\n\nAs I synthesize the insights from the user personas, journey mapping, and intent-based term extraction, I realize that the expanded query should not only include terms directly related to the 1970-1998 warming period and global warming but also terms that reflect the user's intent to understand the origins, rise, and catalysts of the alarmist movement. The final augmented query, \"1970-1998 warming period AND (climate change OR global warming) AND (origins OR rise OR catalyst) AND (alarmism OR activism OR awareness) AND (scientific basis OR public perception OR political impact),\" aims to capture this complexity and surface relevant content that connects the warming period with the emergence of climate change awareness or activism.\n\nThrough this process of applying the user intent and journey mapping technique and balancing structured steps with natural thought patterns, I have generated an expanded query that reflects a deeper understanding of the user's information needs and the complex context of the global warming debate.",
