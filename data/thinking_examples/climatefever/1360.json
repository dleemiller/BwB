  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: In the statistical analysis of time series , a stochastic process is trend stationary if an underlying trend ( function solely of time ) can be removed , leaving a stationary process . The trend does not have to be linear .   Contrarily , if the process requires one or more differencing to be made stationary , then it is called difference stationary and possesses one or more unit roots . Those two concepts may sometimes be confused , but while they share many properties , they are different in many aspects . It is possible for a time series to be non-stationary , have no unit root yet be trend-stationary . In both unit root and trend-stationary processes , the mean can be growing or decreasing over time ; however , in the presence of a shock , trend-stationary processes are mean-reverting ( i.e. transitory , the time serie will converge again towards the growing mean , which was not affected by the shock ) while unit-root processes have a permanent impact on the mean ( i.e. no convergence over time ) .\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: A doomer is a researcher of current and near future trends who believes that global problems of ecological exhaustion -- such as overpopulation , climate change , pollution , and especially peak oil -- will cause the collapse of industrial civilization , and a significant human population die-off . Many doomers are also survivalists or ` preppers ' , that is , they are actively preparing themselves for the doom they anticipate .   Peak oil doomers are alarmed that humanity 's over-reliance on petroleum for agricultural and industrial productivity will cause severe problems on the downward slope of the peak . By contrast , a `` peakist '' would be one who takes a brighter view on the implications of peak oil , although this label has been dismissed from within the doomer 's movement as vacuous .   The opposite of a doomer is represented by the cornucopian , who takes the optimistic position that Earth -- and outer space as well -- will provide an abundance of resources for mankind to thrive on forever . The middle ground between the doomer and the cornucopian is occupied by the environmental skeptic , who believes that claims made by environmentalists in general -- and by doomers in particular -- may be exaggerated or false .\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: Measurement of sea ice is important for safety of navigation and for monitoring the environment , particularly the climate . Sea ice extent interacts with large climate patterns such as the North Atlantic oscillation and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation , to name just two , and influences climate in the rest of the globe .   The amount of sea ice coverage in the arctic has been of interest for centuries , as the Northwest Passage was of high interest for trade and seafaring . There is a longstanding history of records and measurements of some effects of the sea ice extent , but comprehensive measurements were sparse till the 1950s and started with the satellite era in the late 1970s . Modern direct records include data about ice extent , ice area , concentration , thickness , and the age of the ice . The current trends in the records show a significant decline in Northern hemisphere sea ice and a small but statistically significant increase in the winter Southern hemisphere sea ice .   Furthermore , current research comprises and establishes extensive sets of multi-century historical records of arctic and subarctic sea ice and uses , among others high-resolution paleo-proxy sea-ice records . The arctic sea ice is a dynamic climate-system component and is linked to the Atlantic multidecadal variability and the historical climate over various decades . There are circular changes of sea ice patterns but so far no clear patterns based on modeling predictions .\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"In fact, the trend, while not statistically significant, is downward,\" this makes me think of situations where data analysis yields a trend that, despite initial impressions, doesn't meet the threshold for statistical significance. Though the user might actually be trying to understand why their data isn't confirming their hypotheses, or perhaps they're looking for explanations and examples related to downward trends that do not reach statistical significance. Hmm, not sure yet, but it seems like we're dealing with a mix of statistical concepts, data interpretation, and possibly some confusion around what statistical significance really means.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that we have a range of topics from statistical analysis in time series data, discussions around doomers and peak oil, to measurements of sea ice and climate patterns. The strengths of these search terms lie in their ability to touch on various aspects of trend analysis and statistical significance, but the weakness is in their broadness and the potential for irrelevant information. For instance, while discussions about doomers and peak oil might tangentially relate to trends and significance, they don't directly address statistical concepts or methodologies for analyzing downward trends.\n\nLet me approach this using the \"Query Expansion via User Intent and Journey Mapping\" technique, which involves creating user personas, analyzing search vocabulary, mapping information journeys, identifying contextual scenarios, and extracting intent-based terms. This should help because it allows us to systematically consider how different users (from students to experts) might search for information on this topic, ensuring our expanded query captures a wide range of relevant terms and concepts.\n\nFollowing the technique's approach, I first consider the user personas. There's Sarah, a student learning about statistical significance; Mark, a business analyst looking at sales trends; Dr. Anya Sharma, an environmental scientist studying climate data; and Professor David Chen, researching statistical methodologies. Each has different goals, vocabularies, and contexts. For Sarah, initial search terms might be very basic, like \"what is statistical significance?\" or \"why is my trend not significant?\" Mark might search for \"downward trend in sales data\" or \"marginal significance in business,\" reflecting his need for practical applications. Dr. Sharma could be searching for \"statistical power in trend analysis\" or \"type II error in environmental science,\" showing a more advanced understanding and specific context. Professor Chen, being an expert, might look into \"limitations of significance testing\" or \"Bayesian approaches to trend analysis,\" indicating a deeper, more theoretical interest.\n\nAs I apply this step of the technique, I realize the importance of understanding the user's journey. From initial confusion about statistical terms to advanced research into methodologies, each stage of the journey requires different types of information. The initial stage might involve basic explanations and examples, while intermediate stages delve into factors affecting statistical significance, like sample size and effect size. Advanced stages could involve power analysis, non-parametric tests, and even Bayesian approaches. This progression suggests that our expanded query should include terms that cater to these various stages of understanding.\n\nHowever, I also have to consider natural thought patterns and not just stick rigidly to the technique. Intuitively, it seems like users might sometimes confuse statistical significance with practical significance, or they might overlook the importance of sample size in determining statistical power. These considerations remind me of related concepts, like the difference between trend stationarity and difference stationarity in time series analysis, which could be relevant for more advanced users.\n\nApplying the technique systematically, I identify key terms across different personas and journey stages. For explanations and examples related to downward trends not being statistically significant, terms like \"lack of statistical power,\" \"type II error,\" \"effect size,\" and \"sample size limitations\" emerge as crucial. These terms not only reflect the statistical aspects but also touch on the reasons behind a trend's lack of significance, which could be what users are really seeking to understand.\n\nBut then, I have a realization that connects to what we were exploring earlier. The initial query's focus on a downward trend not being statistically significant could also lead users to explore alternative statistical tests or methodologies that might reveal more about their data. This insight points towards including terms related to power analysis, non-parametric tests, or even Bayesian statistics in our expanded query.\n\nThrough this process of applying the \"Query Expansion via User Intent and Journey Mapping\" technique and exploring related threads, I believe the terms that would be most effective for a BM25 index are those that capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking. These include \"downward trend,\" \"statistically significant,\" \"causes,\" \"explanations,\" \"examples,\" \"lack of statistical power,\" \"type II error,\" \"effect size,\" and \"sample size limitations.\" These terms reflect a balance between the structured approach of the technique and the natural, intuitive connections made during the thought process.\n\nIn synthesizing this thought process, it's clear that expanding",
