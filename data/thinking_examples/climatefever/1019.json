  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: The 1997 -- 98 El Ni\u00f1o was regarded as one of the most powerful El Ni\u00f1o -- Southern Oscillation events in recorded history , resulting in widespread droughts , flooding and other natural disasters across the globe . It caused an estimated 16 % of the world 's reef systems to die , and temporarily warmed air temperature by 1.5 \u00b0 C , compared to the usual increase of 0.25 \u00b0 C associated with El Ni\u00f1o events .   It led to a severe outbreak of Rift Valley fever after extreme rainfall in north-eastern Kenya and southern Somalia . It also led to record rainfalls in California during the water season of 1997 -- 98 and one of Indonesia 's worst droughts on record . 1998 ultimately became the warmest year in recorded history ( up until then ) .\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n... Developing countries dependent upon agriculture and fishing , particularly those bordering the Pacific Ocean , are the most affected .\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: From mid-May to mid-June 2019, India and Pakistan had a severe heat wave. It was one of the hottest and longest heat waves since the two countries began recording weather reports. The highest temperatures occurred in Churu, Rajasthan, reaching up to 50.8 \u00b0C (123.4 \u00b0F), a near record high in India, missing the record of 51.0 \u00b0C (123.8 \u00b0F) set in 2016 by a fraction of a degree. As of 12 June 2019, 32 days are classified as parts of the heatwave, making it the second longest ever recorded.As a result of hot temperatures and inadequate preparation, more than 184 people died in the state of Bihar, with many more deaths reported in other parts of the country. In Pakistan, five infants died after extreme heat exposure.The heat wave coincided with extreme droughts and water shortages across India and Pakistan. In mid-June, reservoirs that previously supplied Chennai ran dry, depriving millions. The water crisis was exacerbated by high temperatures and lack of preparation, causing protests and fights that sometimes led to killing and stabbing.\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query about the 2016 global temperature record and its connection to El Ni\u00f1o, this makes me think of the broader context of climate change and how various factors contribute to global warming. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the specific role of El Ni\u00f1o in the warming trend, it's also possible they're seeking a more comprehensive view of what drives climate change. Hmm, not sure yet, but it seems like the query touches on both the immediate effects of El Ni\u00f1o and the long-term patterns of global warming.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, it's clear that while they adequately explain El Ni\u00f1o's role in warming, there's a lack of connection to the specific year 2016 and the broader causes of global warming. The results mention El Ni\u00f1o's impact on global temperatures but don't delve deeply into how this event fits into the larger narrative of climate change, including other factors like greenhouse gases, ocean heat content, and anthropogenic climate forcing.\n\nLet me approach this using the Conceptual Territory Mapping technique, which involves creating a detailed map of the concepts surrounding the topic. By identifying the central coordinates of the query, I can establish a framework for exploring related ideas. The exact center point here seems to be the intersection of El Ni\u00f1o and the 2016 global temperature record. Setting the scale for exploration, I'm aiming for a balance between granular details and broad context, as the query seems to demand both specificity about El Ni\u00f1o's impact and a general understanding of global warming causes.\n\nAs I chart the boundaries of the query's immediate territory, I notice neighboring domains such as climate modeling, the role of La Ni\u00f1a, and the impacts of climate change on global ecosystems. It's also crucial to identify areas where these territories overlap or connect, such as the feedback mechanisms between ocean temperatures and atmospheric CO2 concentrations.\n\nPlotting major landmarks, I identify key concepts like the IPCC reports, the Keeling Curve, and the Paris Agreement as essential for understanding the global response to climate change. These landmarks also serve as \"settlements\" where communities of practice and schools of thought converge, offering insights into the methodologies and processes used in climate science.\n\nFor detail mapping, filling in specialized features within each region involves labeling with precise terminology and noting historical developments and emerging trends. The Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), ocean heat content, and atmospheric CO2 concentrations are critical features that help explain the complex interactions within the Earth's climate system.\n\nCreating a cartographic legend of the most important terms helps in classifying them by region and significance. Terms like ENSO, global warming potential, sea surface temperature anomaly, and mitigation strategies become crucial for navigating this knowledge landscape. They not only provide a pathway for understanding the query's specifics but also offer a framework for exploring the broader implications of climate change.\n\nThrough this process of applying the Conceptual Territory Mapping technique and exploring related threads, I believe the terms that would be most effective for a BM25 index are those that capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking. The augmented query, which includes terms like El Ni\u00f1o, La Ni\u00f1a, global warming causes, 2016 temperature record, climate change impacts, and mitigation strategies, emerges logically from both the technique and natural insights. It reflects a comprehensive approach to understanding the 2016 global temperature record within the context of climate change, acknowledging the complexity of factors at play and the need for a multifaceted inquiry.",
