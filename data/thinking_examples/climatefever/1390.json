  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: Southern tick-associated rash illness ( STARI ) or Masters ' disease is an emerging infectious disease related to Lyme disease that occurs in southeastern and south-central United States . It is spread by tick bites , but the organism that causes the infection is unknown .\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n... Despite appropriate treatment , about 10 to 20 % of people develop joint pains , memory problems , and feel tired for at least six months .   Lyme disease is transmitted to humans by the bite of infected ticks of the Ixodes genus . Usually , the tick must be attached for 36 to 48 hours before the bacteria can spread . In North America , Borrelia burgdorferi and Borrelia mayonii are the cause . In Europe and Asia , the bacteria Borrelia afzelii and Borrelia garinii are also causes of the disease . The disease does not appear to be transmissible between people , by other animals , or through food . Diagnosis is based upon a combination of symptoms , history of tick exposure , and possibly testing for specific antibodies in the blood . Blood tests are often negative in the early stages of the disease . Testing of individual ticks is not typically useful .   Prevention includes efforts to prevent tick bites such as by wearing long pants and using DEET . ...\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n... Generally , for snow to occur , the polar jet stream must move southward through Texas and into the Gulf of Mexico , with a stalled cold front across the southern portion of the state curving northeastward to combine freezing air into the frontal clouds . While light snowfall occurs a few times each decade across the northern panhandle , most of the state is too far south of the cold continental air masses responsible for generating snowfall in the rest of the country . The mean maximum monthly snowfall in most parts of Florida is zero . The only other areas in the continental United States with this distinction are extreme southern Texas and parts of coastal southern California .   Much of the known information on snow in Florida prior to 1900 is from climatological records provided by the National Weather Service meteorological station in Jacksonville , and information for other locations is sparse . The earliest recorded instance of snow in Florida occurred in 1774 ; being unaccustomed to snow , some Jacksonville residents called it `` extraordinary white rain . '' The first White Christmas in northeastern Florida 's history resulted from a snow event that occurred on December 23 , 1989 .\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"Lyme Disease is much more common in northern, cooler regions of the United States than in southern, warmer regions,\" this makes me think of the potential underlying factors contributing to this geographical correlation. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the impact of climate change on the spread of Lyme Disease, I'm not sure yet how deep they want to dive into the specifics of vector biology, epidemiology, or the ecological distribution of disease vectors.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the top documents discuss various aspects of Lyme Disease, including its transmission, symptoms, diagnosis, and prevention. However, there seems to be a lack of direct information connecting climate change to the disease's prevalence in specific regions. The text snippets from documents at k=1 and k=2 provide valuable insights into the disease's characteristics and transmission but do not explicitly address the climate change angle. The snippet from k=10 seems unrelated at first glance, discussing snowfall patterns in the United States, but it might indirectly relate to climate patterns and their potential influence on tick habitats.\n\nLet me approach this using the Query Expansion via Conceptual Territory Mapping technique, which involves creating a detailed map of the conceptual territory surrounding the topic. This should help because it will allow me to systematically explore the relationships between climate, Lyme Disease, and geographical factors, as well as identify key landmarks in the field, such as major research institutions and historical records of tick-borne illnesses.\n\nFollowing the technique's steps, I start by identifying the central coordinates of the query, which are the relationship between climate (temperature, humidity) and Lyme Disease incidence. The boundary areas include vector biology, epidemiology, environmental science, and public health. Key landmarks would be the Northeastern US, the Appalachian Region, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), and Yale School of Public Health. Detail features to consider are blacklegged tick habitat, Lyme bacteria transmission cycle, climate modeling, and public health interventions.\n\nAs I apply the technique, I notice that considering the blacklegged tick distribution and its habitat preferences is crucial. This step of the technique is revealing insights into how climate change could affect tick populations and, consequently, Lyme Disease transmission. It reminds me of the concept of ecological niches and how changes in climate can alter the distribution and prevalence of disease vectors. I need to consider how climate change impacts the environment in a way that might expand or contract the habitats of ticks, thereby influencing the spread of Lyme Disease.\n\nHowever, I'm also noticing this interesting pattern where the discussion around Lyme Disease often touches upon public health interventions and the importance of awareness and prevention strategies. This makes me think about the role of education and community engagement in mitigating the risk of Lyme Disease, especially in areas where climate change might be increasing the tick population.\n\nThrough this process, insights are emerging from both the structured approach and my intuition. Applying the specific aspect of the technique related to landmark identification leads me to consider the role of research institutions like the CDC and Yale School of Public Health in studying and addressing Lyme Disease. My instinct says we should also consider the economic and social impacts of Lyme Disease on communities, especially in regions where the disease is becoming more prevalent due to climate change.\n\nSynthesizing all this information, I believe the terms that would be most effective for a BM25 index, capturing both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, are related to the impact of climate change on Lyme Disease transmission, blacklegged tick distribution, and public health interventions in the Northeastern United States. These terms emerge logically from both the technique and the natural insights gained during the thought process, ensuring a comprehensive and relevant query expansion.",
