  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: A polar vortex is an upper level low-pressure area lying near the Earth 's pole . There are two polar vortices in the Earth 's atmosphere , which overlie the North , and South Poles . Each polar vortex is a persistent , large-scale , low pressure zone that rotates counter-clockwise at the North Pole ( called a cyclone ) , and clockwise at the South Pole . The bases of the two polar vortices are located in the middle and upper troposphere and extend into the stratosphere . Beneath that lies a large mass of cold , dense arctic air . The vortices weaken and strengthen from year to year . When the vortex of the arctic is strong it is well defined , there is a single vortex and the arctic air is well contained ; when weaker , which it generally is , it will break into two or more vortices ; when very weak , the flow of arctic air becomes more disorganized and masses of cold arctic air can push equatorward , bringing with it a rapid and sharp temperature drop . The interface between the cold dry air mass of the pole and the warm moist air mass further south defines the location of the polar front . ...\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n... On other planets , internal heat rather than solar heating drives their jet streams . The Polar jet stream forms near the interface of the Polar and Ferrel circulation cells ; while the subtropical jet forms near the boundary of the Ferrel and Hadley circulation cells .   Other jet streams also exist . During the Northern Hemisphere summer , easterly jets can form in tropical regions , typically where dry air encounters more humid air at high altitudes . Low-level jets also are typical of various regions such as the central United States .   Meteorologists use the location of some of the jet streams as an aid in weather forecasting . The main commercial relevance of the jet streams is in air travel , as flight time can be dramatically affected by either flying with the flow or against , which results in significant fuel and time cost savings for airlines . Often , the airlines work to fly ` with ' the jet stream for this reason . Dynamic North Atlantic Tracks are one example of how airlines and air traffic control work together to accommodate the jet steam and winds aloft that results in the maximum benefit for airlines and other users . Clear-air turbulence , a potential hazard to aircraft passenger safety , is often found in a jet stream 's vicinity , but it does not create a substantial alteration on flight times .\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: Wind shear , sometimes referred to as windshear or wind gradient , is a difference in wind speed and/or direction over a relatively short distance in the atmosphere . Atmospheric wind shear is normally described as either vertical or horizontal wind shear . Vertical wind shear is a change in wind speed or direction with change in altitude . Horizontal wind shear is a change in wind speed with change in lateral position for a given altitude .   Wind shear is a microscale meteorological phenomenon occurring over a very small distance , but it can be associated with mesoscale or synoptic scale weather features such as squall lines and cold fronts . ...\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"The jet stream forms a boundary between the cold north and the warmer south, but the lower temperature difference means the winds are now weaker,\" this makes me think of the complexities of global weather patterns and how they're influenced by various factors, including climate change. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the implications of a weaker jet stream on regional weather, I'm not sure yet what specific aspects they're most interested in.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the initial documents provide a good foundation in understanding the basics of the jet stream and its role in weather patterns. However, they lack the depth and personal insights that would come from a community Q&A setting. The text snippets from documents at k=1, k=2, and k=10 offer valuable information on polar vortices, jet streams on other planets, and wind shear, which could be relevant to understanding the jet stream's behavior and impacts.\n\nTo expand this query effectively, I'll approach it using the \"Query Expansion via Community Q&A Patterns\" technique, which involves reframing the original query into different question types, identifying hidden motivations behind the query, and extracting valuable response patterns and community interactions. This technique should help because it allows us to consider how real people discuss and explore topics in conversational settings, which can reveal subtle aspects and related interests not immediately apparent from formal documents.\n\nFirst, let's reframe the query into personal experience questions, such as \"What is it like to experience weather changes due to a weaker jet stream?\" or advice-seeking questions like \"How can I prepare for the impacts of a weaker jet stream on my local weather?\" This helps in understanding the potential personal and practical implications of the query.\n\nNext, identifying the hidden motivations, such as seeking validation for concerns about climate change or looking for insider knowledge on weather patterns, can guide us toward more relevant and engaging expansions of the query.\n\nApplying the technique systematically, I consider the answer archetypes that would be most valuable, such as first-person experience narratives, expert opinions, or step-by-step practical advice. The community interactions, like common follow-up questions or frequently debated aspects, can also provide insights into how the query might evolve in a discussion.\n\nAs I extract terminology from the conversational context, I notice terms like \"unusual weather,\" \"climate change effects,\" \"jet stream variability,\" and \"weather predictions\" emerging. These terms reflect how people naturally discuss these topics in Q&A settings, incorporating both subjective experiences and factual information.\n\nThrough this process, I had a few false starts, reconsidering the importance of certain terms over others, but the technique helped me stay focused on the community's perspective. I also made some intuitive connections between the jet stream's weakening and broader climate change discussions, which seemed to resonate with the user's potential underlying motivations.\n\nThe technique pointed me toward considering the causes of a weaker jet stream, its impact on regional weather, connections to climate change, and even personal experiences with unusual weather, which all seem directly relevant to what the user might be seeking. My instinct says we should also consider the long-term consequences of a weakened jet stream and how it might affect daily life in different regions.\n\nSynthesizing all these insights, I believe the expanded query should indeed include terms like \"causes weaker jet stream,\" \"impact regional weather,\" \"climate change connections,\" and \"personal experiences unusual weather.\" These terms capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, reflecting a balanced approach between the structured technique and natural cognitive patterns.",
