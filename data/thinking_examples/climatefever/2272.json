The previous deglaciation took place between approximately 22ka until 11.5 ka . This occurred when there was an annual mean atmospheric temperature on the earth that increased by roughly 5 \u00b0 C , which was also accompanied by regional high-latitude warming that exceeded 10 \u00b0 C .

  "thought_process": "As I delve into the original query, \"It found the scientists' rigour and honesty are not in doubt, and their behaviour did not prejudice the IPCC's conclusions, though they did fail to display the proper degree of openness,\" my initial impression is that this inquiry is about a specific event or incident involving scientists and their conduct in relation to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and its findings. The mention of \"rigour,\" \"honesty,\" \"behaviour,\" and \"openness\" suggests a focus on the ethical aspects of scientific research and its impact on the conclusions drawn by the IPCC.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the text snippets provided touch on the topics of climate change, scientific techniques for reconstructing past temperatures, and the controversy surrounding certain findings and their representation in reports like the IPCC's Third Assessment Report. The snippets from documents at k=1 and k=2 specifically mention the work of Mann, Bradley, and Hughes, known as the MBH98 and MBH99 studies, which have been focal points of discussion and debate regarding the \"hockey stick\" graph. This graph is a visual representation of global temperatures over the centuries, showing a sharp increase in recent times, akin to the blade of a hockey stick.\n\nThe task at hand is to expand the query using the technique of Conceptual Graph Traversal, a method that involves constructing a graph of concepts and their relationships to identify relevant terms for query expansion. This approach requires identifying core concepts, determining the search intent, listing implicit assumptions, and understanding how these elements relate to each other and to broader domains.\n\nTo transition into the structured approach, I start by applying the steps of Conceptual Graph Traversal. First, I identify the core concepts from the original query, which include \"scientists,\" \"IPCC,\" \"behaviour,\" \"conclusions,\" and \"openness.\" The search intent appears to be informational, aiming to understand the nature of the scientists' actions, their impact on the IPCC's conclusions, and the broader context of these events. Implicit assumptions include the relevance of ethical conduct in scientific research to the validity of findings and the potential controversy surrounding certain scientific conclusions.\n\nConstructing the conceptual graph involves creating nodes for these core concepts and exploring their relationships. For instance, \"scientists\" can be connected to \"IPCC\" through their role in contributing research that informs the IPCC's conclusions. \"Behaviour\" is linked to \"openness\" and \"conclusions\" as it affects the trustworthiness and validity of scientific findings. The graph also includes nodes for broader concepts like \"climate change,\" \"scientific misconduct,\" \"transparency,\" and \"peer review,\" which are relevant to the context and implications of the scientists' actions.\n\nTo select expansion paths, I consider various directions such as synonymous terms, hierarchical terms, compositional terms, contextual terms, and domain-specific terminology. For example, synonymous terms for \"behaviour\" might include \"conduct\" or \"actions,\" while hierarchical terms could involve broader concepts like \"professional ethics\" or narrower concepts like \"data manipulation.\" Compositional terms might delve into specific aspects of scientific conduct, such as \"research integrity\" or \"conflict of interest.\" Contextual terms could relate to the specific domain of climate science, including \"climate modeling,\" \"temperature reconstruction,\" or \"policy implications.\" Domain-specific terminology might involve technical terms like \"eigenvector-based climate field reconstruction\" or acronyms relevant to the field, such as \"CFR\" or \"TAR.\"\n\nApplying these expansion paths systematically, I extract high-value terms that are relevant, distinctive, specific, and searchable. Terms like \"scientific misconduct,\" \"transparency,\" \"peer review,\" \"research ethics,\" and \"data integrity\" emerge as strong candidates for query expansion. They not only relate directly to the core concepts but also capture the essence of the search intent, which is to understand the ethical dimensions of scientific research and their implications for the conclusions drawn by bodies like the IPCC.\n\nAs I balance the structured steps of Conceptual Graph Traversal with natural thought patterns, I find myself occasionally reconsidering the relevance of certain terms or exploring tangents that seem promising. For instance, the mention of \"hockey stick\" in the initial results leads me to think about the controversy surrounding climate change research and how that might influence the choice of expansion terms. Intuitive connections are made between the original query's focus on openness and the broader issues of transparency and accountability in scientific research.\n\nThrough this process, insights emerge from both the structured approach and natural intuition. The systematic application of Conceptual Graph Traversal helps to identify a robust set of expansion terms that are logically connected to the original query. At the same time, natural cognitive elements like reconsiderations, intuitive leaps, and the exploration of related concepts enrich the query expansion process, ensuring that the final terms are not only relevant but also capture",
