As of the end of 2016 , the U.S. had 40 gigawatts ( GW ) of installed photovoltaic capacity , having almost doubled in capacity from the previous year . In the twelve months through March 2017 , utility scale solar power generated 38.3 terawatt-hours ( TWh ) , 0.94 % of total U.S. electricity . During the same time period total solar generation , including estimated distributed solar photovoltaic generation , was 59.8 TWh , 1.47 % of total U.S. electricity . In terms of total installed capacity , by year end 2015 the USA ranked 4th in the world behind China , Germany , and Japan . In 2016 , 39 % of all new electricity generation capacity in the country came from solar , more than any other source and ahead of natural gas ( 29 % ) . By 2015 , solar employment had overtaken oil and gas as well as coal employment in the U.S.   The United States conducted much early research in photovoltaics and concentrated solar power . ...\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: Renewable energy in the United States accounted for 13.44 percent of the domestically produced electricity in 2015 , and 11.1 percent of total energy generation . As of 2016 , more than 260,000 people work in the solar industry and 43 states deploy net metering , where energy utilities buy back excess power generated by solar arrays .   Renewable energy reached a major milestone in the first quarter of 2011 , when it contributed 11.7 percent of total U.S. energy production ( 2.245 quadrillion BTU of energy ) , surpassing energy production from nuclear power ( 2.125 quadrillion BTU ) . 2011 was the first year since 1997 that renewables exceeded nuclear in US total energy production .   Hydroelectric power is currently the largest producer of renewable power in the U.S. . It produced around 6.14 % of the nation 's total electricity in 2015 which was 45.71 % of the total renewable power in the U.S. . The United States is the fourth largest producer of hydroelectricity in the world after China , Canada and Brazil . ...\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n...

  "thought_process": "As I delve into the query about California's dominance in solar power generation and employment, my initial impression is that this is a multifaceted issue, involving not just the technical aspects of solar power, but also economic, environmental, and policy dimensions. The user might be looking for a comprehensive overview that includes statistics on solar power generation, the number of jobs in the solar industry, and perhaps the policies that have contributed to California's leading position in this field.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the top documents provide a good starting point, discussing the current state of solar power in the United States, including installed capacity, generation, and employment. However, to fully address the query, we need to dig deeper into California-specific information and the factors that have led to its prominence in solar power. The initial results touch on national trends and the growth of the solar industry but lack the specific focus on California that the query demands.\n\nTo transition to a more structured approach, I'll utilize the \"Query Expansion via Multi-Disciplinary Expert Panel\" technique. This involves convening a panel of experts from different disciplines relevant to the query: energy policy, economics, technology, environmental impact, and labor market dynamics. Each expert will analyze the query from their perspective, identifying key concepts, methodologies, and specialized vocabulary that might have been overlooked in the original query.\n\nStarting with the expert selection process, I identify Dr. Anya Sharma as an energy policy analyst, Dr. Ben Carter as an economist specializing in renewable energy, Dr. Chloe Davis as a solar energy technology expert, Dr. David Evans as an environmental impact assessment specialist, and Dr. Emily Fox as a labor market analyst for green jobs. Each of these experts will contribute unique insights and terminology related to their field.\n\nIn the individual consultations, Dr. Sharma highlights the importance of California's Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) and other policies in driving solar power adoption. Dr. Carter emphasizes the role of economic incentives, such as tax credits and subsidies, in the growth of the solar industry. Dr. Davis discusses the technological advancements and high solar irradiance levels in California that contribute to its solar power generation capabilities. Dr. Evans points out the need to consider environmental impact, including land use and lifecycle assessment of solar power technologies. Dr. Fox focuses on the types of jobs created by the solar industry in California and the required skill sets and training programs.\n\nDuring the panel discussion, the experts identify cross-disciplinary connections and complementary tools and frameworks. For instance, the interplay between energy policies and economic incentives directly impacts the deployment of solar technologies, which in turn affects labor market dynamics and environmental considerations.\n\nBased on the expert insights and the initial results, I synthesize the key terms and concepts into an expanded query. This includes terms like \"California solar power generation statistics comparison,\" \"California solar jobs numbers,\" \"Renewable Portfolio Standard California,\" \"solar power economic incentives California,\" and \"solar irradiance levels California.\" These terms capture the multifaceted nature of the query, incorporating policy, economic, technological, environmental, and labor market aspects.\n\nThe recommended resources, including reports from the California Energy Commission, data from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, and statistics from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, will provide a comprehensive foundation for understanding California's dominance in solar power.\n\nThrough this process of applying the \"Query Expansion via Multi-Disciplinary Expert Panel\" technique and exploring related threads, I believe the identified terms and concepts will be most effective for capturing the essence of the query. They balance the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, combining structured technique with natural cognitive patterns to provide a thorough and informative search.",
