The effort has focused on changes observed during the period of instrumental temperature record , when records are most reliable ; particularly in the last 50 years , when human activity has grown fastest and observations of the troposphere have become available . The dominant mechanisms are anthropogenic , i.e. , the result of human activity . They are :  increasing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases  global changes to land surface , such as deforestation  increasing atmospheric concentrations of aerosols .   There are also natural mechanisms for variation including climate oscillations , changes in solar activity , and volcanic activity .   According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , it is `` extremely likely '' that human influence was the dominant cause of global warming between 1951 and 2010 . ...\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: Climate change is a change in the statistical distribution of weather patterns when that change lasts for an extended period of time ( i.e. , decades to millions of years ) . Climate change may refer to a change in average weather conditions , or in the time variation of weather around longer-term average conditions ( i.e. , more or fewer extreme weather events ) . Climate change is caused by factors such as biotic processes , variations in solar radiation received by Earth , plate tectonics , and volcanic eruptions . Certain human activities have been identified as primary causes of ongoing climate change , often referred to as global warming .   Scientists actively work to understand past and future climate by using observations and theoretical models .

More recent data are provided by the instrumental record .

  "thought_process": "Let's dive into the thought process of expanding the query \"The data suggests solar activity is influencing the global climate causing the world to get warmer\" using the conceptual territory mapping technique. Initially, this query makes me think of the intricate relationships between solar activity, global climate change, and the factors that contribute to warming. The user might be trying to understand how solar activity fits into the broader discussion of climate change, which is often dominated by anthropogenic factors.\n\nAnalyzing the initial results, particularly the text snippets from documents at k=1 and k=2, it's clear that climate change is a multifaceted issue involving both natural mechanisms like solar activity and human-induced factors such as greenhouse gas emissions. The mention of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the emphasis on human influence as the dominant cause of global warming between 1951 and 2010 provide a strong foundation for understanding the scientific consensus on climate change.\n\nNow, applying the conceptual territory mapping technique, I start by identifying the central coordinates of the query. The exact center point is the influence of solar activity on global climate warming, with cardinal directions that include scientific consensus, anthropogenic factors, and natural climate variability. The appropriate scale for exploration is both granular, to understand specific mechanisms, and broad, to capture the complexity of climate change dynamics.\n\nExploring the boundaries of the query's immediate territory, it's essential to chart neighboring domains and disciplines. This includes geoengineering efforts, studies on urban heat islands, the impact of renewable energy on climate, atmospheric science disciplines, and environmental policy and regulation. Noting areas where territories overlap or connect, such as the intersection of solar activity with anthropogenic factors in climate change models, is crucial for a comprehensive understanding.\n\nIdentifying landmarks within this conceptual territory involves plotting major key concepts and essential resources. The IPCC reports, NASA's solar radiation research, NOAA's climate monitoring programs, and leading climate change research universities are significant landmarks. These landmarks not only provide a framework for understanding but also serve as conduits for deeper exploration into the specifics of climate change research and policy.\n\nDetail mapping involves filling in specialized features within each region of the conceptual territory. This includes labeling with precise, domain-specific terminology such as solar irradiance measurements, carbon dioxide emission metrics, Earth System Models (ESMs), and historical climate data analysis. Noting historical sites, such as the discovery of the ozone hole over Antarctica, and emerging developments in climate science and policy is also vital.\n\nCreating a cartographic legend or a lexicon of the most important terms on the map is the final step. This involves classifying terms by region and significance, selecting those that would help a traveler navigate this knowledge landscape. Terms like \"solar cycle variability,\" \"climate sensitivity,\" \"radiative forcing,\" and \"mitigation strategies\" are not only crucial for understanding the complex interactions within the climate system but also for developing effective strategies to address climate change.\n\nThrough this process of applying conceptual territory mapping and exploring related threads, I believe the terms that would be most effective for a BM25 index include those that capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking. This includes comparative analyses of solar activity and anthropogenic factors, insights from IPCC reports, implications of geoengineering, and the broader context of atmospheric science and climate change policy. The final expanded query, \"Solar activity and its influence on global climate warming: comparative analysis with anthropogenic factors, IPCC reports, geoengineering implications, atmospheric science insights,\" reflects a synthesis of structured technique and natural cognitive patterns, aiming to provide a comprehensive framework for exploring the complex territory of climate change.",
