  "reasoning": "The original query focuses on Prof. Adam Scaife's statement regarding the link between shrinking Arctic ice and climate change, emphasizing his expertise and evidence supporting this claim. To enhance the search results for a community Q&A context like Quora, it is essential to explore how users might naturally expand or reframe their queries based on personal experiences, advice needs, opinion requests, comparisons, and stories related to the topic. Additionally, understanding the hidden motivations of the askers can guide the augmentation process by revealing what deeper insights or support they are seeking. The document types reveal strengths in scientific credibility and climate data relevance but weaknesses in off-topic energy reports and controversies. Augmenting the query involves incorporating conversational elements reflecting how people typically discuss such topics.",

  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: Adam Arthur Scaife B.A. M.A. MSc PhD FRMetS ( born 18 March 1970 ) is a British physicist , and head of long range prediction at the Met Office . He is an honorary visiting Professor at Exeter University . Scaife carries out research into long range weather forecasting and computer modelling of the climate . Scaife has published over 100 peer reviewed studies on atmospheric dynamics , computer modelling and climate predictability and change and recently published popular science and academic books on meteorology .\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: HadCRUT is the dataset of monthly instrumental temperature records formed by combining the sea surface temperature records compiled by the Hadley Centre of the UK Met Office and the land surface air temperature records compiled by the Climatic Research Unit ( CRU ) of the University of East Anglia .   The data is provided on a grid of boxes covering the globe , with values provided for only those boxes containing temperature observations in a particular month and year . Interpolation is not applied to infill missing values . The first version of HadCRUT initially spanned the period 1881 -- 1993 , and this was later extended to begin in 1850 and to be regularly updated to the current year/month in near real-time .\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: Real wages are wages adjusted for inflation , or , equivalently , wages in terms of the amount of goods and services that can be bought . This term is used in contrast to nominal wages or unadjusted wages .   Because it has been adjusted to account for changes in the prices of goods and services , real wages provide a clearer representation of an individual 's wages in terms of what they can afford to buy with those wages -- specifically , in terms of the amount of goods and services that can be bought . However , real wages suffer the disadvantage of not being well defined , since the amount of inflation ( which can be calculated based on different combinations of goods and services ) is itself not well defined . Hence real wage defined as the total amount of goods and services that can be bought with a wage , is also not defined . This is because changes in the relative prices of goods and services will change the financial comparability of various bundles of goods and services .   Despite difficulty in defining one value for the real wage , in some cases a real wage can be said to have unequivocally increased . This is true if : After the change , the worker can now afford any bundle of goods and services that he could just barely afford before the change , and still have money left over . In such a situation , real wage increases no matter how inflation is calculated . Specifically , inflation could be calculated based on any good or service or combination thereof , and real wage has still increased . ...\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query about Prof. Adam Scaife's statement on the link between shrinking Arctic ice and climate change, this makes me think of how people might discuss this topic in a community Q&A setting. The user might actually be trying to understand the personal experiences of climate modelers like Prof. Scaife, or seeking opinions from experts on the implications of Arctic ice reduction. However, the original query seems quite specific and focused on scientific evidence, so I need to consider how to expand it to capture the conversational nature of Q&A discussions.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the top documents provide a lot of scientific credibility and relevance to climate data, but there are also some off-topic results related to energy reports and controversies. This suggests that the search terms might be too narrow or specific, and that we need to incorporate more conversational elements to reflect how people typically discuss climate change and Arctic ice.\n\nTo approach this, I'll use the query expansion technique via community Q&A patterns. This involves reframing the original query as personal experience questions, advice-seeking questions, opinion-based questions, comparison questions, and story-soliciting questions. For example, \"What is it like to study the effects of shrinking Arctic ice as a climate modeler?\" or \"How should we interpret Prof. Scaife's findings on Arctic ice reduction?\"\n\nAs I apply this technique, I'll also consider the hidden motivations of the asker. Are they seeking validation for their concerns about climate change impacts? Looking for advice on how to communicate scientific evidence effectively? Desiring insider knowledge from experts like Prof. Scaife? By understanding these motivations, I can identify valuable response patterns to target, such as first-person experience narratives, expert opinions with credibility markers, step-by-step practical advice, contrarian or alternative viewpoints, and nuanced \"it depends\" conditional answers.\n\nNow, let me systematically apply the steps of the query expansion technique. First, I'll reframe the original query as personal experience questions, such as \"What is it like to study the effects of shrinking Arctic ice as a climate modeler?\" or \"How do experts like Prof. Scaife feel about the implications of Arctic ice reduction?\" Next, I'll consider advice-seeking questions, such as \"How should we interpret Prof. Scaife's findings on Arctic ice reduction?\" or \"What can we do to mitigate the effects of climate change on Arctic ice?\"\n\nAs I work through the technique, I'll also keep an eye out for natural thought patterns, such as occasional false starts or reconsiderations. For example, I might think, \"Wait, that's not quite right for this query. Let me adjust my approach to focus more on the conversational aspects of Q&A discussions.\" Or, \"This step of the technique is revealing some interesting insights, which actually reminds me of a related concept that might also be relevant.\"\n\nThrough this process, I'm starting to see some insights emerge from both the structure of the technique and my own intuitive connections. For instance, applying the technique leads me to consider the importance of personal experiences and opinions in Q&A discussions, which might not be immediately apparent from the original query. At the same time, my instinct is telling me that we should also consider the wider context of climate change and its impacts on Arctic ice, rather than just focusing on Prof. Scaife's statement.\n\nAs I synthesize my thoughts, I believe that the expanded query should incorporate terms that reflect the conversational nature of Q&A discussions, such as \"experiences,\" \"opinions,\" and \"scientific consensus.\" This will help capture the nuances of how people discuss climate change and Arctic ice in a community Q&A setting. The final expanded query could be something like \"Prof Adam Scaife on shrinking Arctic ice: experiences, opinions, and scientific consensus.\"",
