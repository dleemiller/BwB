  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: A sea level rise is an increase in the volume of water in the world 's oceans , resulting in an increase in global mean sea level . Sea level rise is usually attributed to global climate change by thermal expansion of the water in the oceans and by melting of Ice sheets and glaciers on land . Melting of floating ice shelves or icebergs at sea raises sea levels only slightly .   Sea level rise at specific locations may be more or less than the global average . Local factors might include tectonic effects , subsidence of the land , tides , currents , storms , etc. .  Sea level rise is expected to continue for centuries . Because of the slow inertia , long response time for parts of the climate system , it has been estimated that we are already committed to a sea-level rise of approximately 2.3 m for each degree Celsius of temperature rise within the next 2,000 years . IPCC Summary for Policymakers , AR5 , 2014 , indicated that the global mean sea level rise will continue during the 21st century , very likely at a faster rate than observed from 1971 to 2010 . Projected rates and amounts vary . A January 2017 NOAA report suggests a range of GMSL rise of 0.3 -- 2.5 m possible during the 21st century .   Sea level rises can considerably influence human populations in coastal and island regions and natural environments like marine ecosystems .\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: Regional effects of global warming are long-term significant changes in the expected patterns of average weather of a specific region due to global warming . The world average temperature is rising due to the greenhouse effect caused by increasing levels of greenhouse gases , especially carbon dioxide . When the global temperature changes , the changes in climate are not expected to be uniform across the Earth . In particular , land areas change more quickly than oceans , and northern high latitudes change more quickly than the tropics , and the margins of biome regions change faster than do their cores .   Regional effects of global warming vary in nature . Some are the result of a generalised global change , such as rising temperature , resulting in local effects , such as melting ice . In other cases , a change may be related to a change in a particular ocean current or weather system . In such cases , the regional effect may be disproportionate and will not necessarily follow the global trend . The increasing temperatures from greenhouse gases have been causing sea levels to rise for many years .   There are three major ways in which global warming will make changes to regional climate : melting or forming ice , changing the hydrological cycle ( of evaporation and precipitation ) and changing currents in the oceans and air flows in the atmosphere . The coast can also be considered a region , and will suffer severe impacts from sea level rise .\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: Climate variability includes all the variations in the climate that last longer than individual weather events, whereas the term climate change only refers to those variations that persist for a longer period of time, typically decades or more. In the time since the industrial revolution the climate has increasingly been affected by human activities that are causing global warming and climate change.The climate system receives nearly all of its energy from the sun. The climate system also radiates energy to outer space. The balance of incoming and outgoing energy, and the passage of the energy through the climate system, determines Earth's energy budget. When the incoming energy is greater than the outgoing energy, earth's energy budget is positive and the climate system is warming. If more energy goes out, the energy budget is negative and earth experiences cooling. The energy moving through Earth's climate system finds expression in weather, varying on geographic scales and time. Long-term averages and variability of weather in a region constitute the region's climate. ...\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query about local and regional sea levels, this makes me think of the complex interplay between global climate trends and local geological factors. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the specific impacts on their area, it's clear that the query touches on a broader spectrum of factors influencing sea level rise. The mention of local and regional variability hints at the user's desire to move beyond general global trends and delve into the nuances of how sea levels are affected in different areas.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, it's evident that the search terms provided yield information that is both relevant and extensive. However, there's a noticeable lack of specificity regarding local factors and how they intersect with climate change to affect sea levels. The initial results highlight the importance of understanding global climate change but also underscore the need for localized data and insights. This weakness in the original query results suggests that expanding the search terms to include more specific local and geological factors could significantly enhance the relevance and usefulness of the search outcomes.\n\nTransitioning to a more structured approach, I'll be using the Query Expansion via User Intent and Journey Mapping technique. This technique involves creating user personas with varying levels of expertise and understanding how their search vocabulary and information needs evolve as they progress from novices to experts. By mapping the journey of these personas, we can identify key terms, concepts, and scenarios that reflect the diverse ways users might search for information on local and regional sea level changes.\n\nApplying this technique systematically, the first step is to create distinct user personas: a Concerned Citizen (novice), a Local Government Official (intermediate), a Coastal Geologist (advanced), and a Climate Change Researcher (expert). Each persona has different goals, motivations, prior knowledge, and vocabulary related to sea level rise. For instance, a novice might start with broad terms like \"sea level rising near me,\" while an expert might use more specialized terms such as \"paleo sea level reconstructions\" or \"climate forcing on regional sea level trends.\"\n\nAs I delve deeper into the personas and their search behaviors, it becomes clear that their information needs and search vocabularies change significantly as they progress in their understanding. The novice is looking for basic information and local impacts, the intermediate user seeks data on regional variations and projections, the advanced user delves into causes and geological influences, and the expert explores modeling, predictions, and historical context. This progression helps in identifying a wide range of relevant terms and concepts that can be used to expand the original query.\n\nInterspersing the systematic application of the technique with natural cognitive elements, I notice that there are occasional false starts or reconsiderations. For example, initially, it might seem that focusing solely on climate change terms would suffice, but upon further reflection, the importance of geological factors, such as tectonic subsidence and isostatic adjustment, becomes apparent. There are also intuitive connections that complement the technique, such as realizing that users might be interested in both the current state of sea level rise and projections for the future, which leads to considering terms related to adaptation strategies and historical sea levels.\n\nStepping back to reassess, it's evident that the expanded query needs to balance the explicit and implicit aspects of the user's information needs. The technique helps in systematically identifying key terms and concepts, but natural insights and reconsiderations add depth and nuance to the query expansion process. For instance, recognizing that users might be evaluating flood risks or developing adaptation strategies highlights the need for terms that reflect practical applications and decision-making contexts.\n\nThrough this process of applying the Query Expansion via User Intent and Journey Mapping technique and exploring related threads, I believe the terms identified\u2014such as \"local factors affecting sea level rise,\" \"geological and climate influences,\" and specific scenarios like \"evaluating flood risks\" and \"understanding impacts on local ecosystems\"\u2014would be most effective for capturing the user's intent. These terms reflect both the structured approach of understanding user journeys and the natural cognitive patterns of considering diverse user needs and contexts.\n\nIn synthesizing the insights with clarity, it's apparent that the expanded query, \"local factors affecting sea level rise [city name] including geological and climate influences,\" more accurately reflects the complexity of the user's information needs. This query balances the need for localized information with an understanding of the broader geological and climate factors influencing sea level rise, thereby enhancing the likelihood of retrieving relevant and useful search results.",
