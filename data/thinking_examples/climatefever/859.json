  "reasoning": "The query focuses on a specific climate change prediction (southern Europe drought by 2080) and its mitigation through emissions reductions. Current results lack this specificity, focusing on general drought information. To augment the search, I've selected experts who can address climate modeling, regional climate dynamics, policy implications, historical analogies, and agricultural impacts. Their insights will guide the expansion of the query with relevant terminology and concepts, addressing the weaknesses identified in the initial results.",

These choking billows of dust -- named `` black blizzards '' or `` black rollers '' -- traveled cross country , reaching as far as the East Coast and striking such cities as New York City and Washington , D.C. On the Plains , they often reduced visibility to 1 metre ( 3.3 ft ) or less . Associated Press reporter Robert E. Geiger happened to be in Boise City , Oklahoma , to witness the `` Black Sunday '' black blizzards of April 14 , 1935 ; Edward Stanley , Kansas City news editor of the Associated Press coined the term `` Dust Bowl '' while rewriting Geiger 's news story . ...\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: A megadrought ( or mega-drought ) is a prolonged drought lasting two decades or longer . Past megadroughts have been associated with persistent multiyear La Ni\u00f1a conditions ( cooler than normal water temperatures in the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean ) .   The term megadrought is generally used to describe the length of a drought , and not its acute intensity . In scientific literature the term is used to describe decades-long droughts or multi-decadal droughts . Multiyear droughts of less than a decade , such as the Dust Bowl drought of the 1930s , are generally not described as megadroughts even though they are of a long duration . In popular literature multiyear or even single year droughts are occasionally described as megadroughts based upon their severity , the economic damage they inflict or other criteria , but this is the exception and not the rule .\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: The 2013 extreme weather events included several all-time temperature records in Northern and Southern Hemisphere . The February extent of snow cover in Eurasia and North America was above average , while the extent of Arctic ice in the same month was 4,5 % below the 1981 -- 2010 average . The Northern Hemisphere weather extremes have been linked to the melting of Arctic sea ice , which alters atmospheric circulation in a way that leads to more snow and ice .   By January 11 , 233 weather-related deaths were reported in India . Elsewhere , particularly in Russia , the Czech Republic and the United Kingdom , low temperatures affected wildlife , delaying bird breeding and disrupting the bird migration . On January 10 Bangladesh faced the lowest temperature since country 's independence , at 3.0 \u00b0 C in Saidpur . While Finland and most of Northern European countries got the record high , and even the highest temperatures at Europe during May and June , Western - and Middle Europe faced much cooler weather and even their wettest May and June ever . During summer prolonged heat waves in the Northern Hemisphere set new record high temperatures .   On March 24 , 2014 , the secretary-general of the World Meteorological Organization Michel Jarraud announced that `` many of the extreme events of 2013 were consistent with what we would expect as a result of human-induced climate change '' .\n",
  "thought_process": "As I delve into the original query, \"By 2080, without dramatic reductions in emissions, southern Europe will be in permanent extreme drought, much worse than the American dust bowl ever was,\" my first impression is that this is a stark prediction with significant implications for climate change, agriculture, and policy. The mention of the American dust bowl serves as a historical reference point, making the potential future scenario in southern Europe even more alarming. I wonder if the user is looking for evidence to support or refute this prediction, or perhaps seeking strategies for mitigation and adaptation.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that they lack the specificity required to address the user's concern effectively. The text snippets provided, discussing the Dust Bowl, megadroughts, and extreme weather events, offer some relevant historical and scientific context but do not directly tackle the query's focus on southern Europe's future climate scenario. The strengths of these results lie in their ability to provide a broad understanding of droughts and climate change impacts, but their weakness is the absence of targeted information on southern Europe's climate projections and the potential for permanent extreme drought by 2080.\n\nTo expand this query effectively, I decide to employ the \"Query Expansion via Multi-Disciplinary Expert Panel\" technique. This approach involves convening a panel of experts from various disciplines relevant to the query, including climatology, hydrology, environmental policy, history, and agricultural science. Each expert will bring unique insights, terminology, and perspectives to the table, allowing for a comprehensive expansion of the query.\n\nThe process begins with the selection of experts. For this query, the panel consists of Dr. Elena Rossi, a climatologist specializing in European climate models and drought forecasting; Dr. Javier Silva, a hydrologist focusing on water resource management and drought mitigation strategies; Dr. Ingrid M\u00fcller, an environmental policy analyst specializing in climate change policy and international agreements for emissions reductions; Dr. Alistair McGregor, a historian specializing in the social and economic impacts of historical droughts and famines; and Dr. Sofia Lorenzo, an agricultural scientist researching drought-resistant crops and sustainable farming practices.\n\nThrough individual consultations and a panel discussion, these experts identify key concepts, methodologies, and specialized vocabulary relevant to the query. They note the importance of climate models like EURO-CORDEX for predicting drought risk in southern Europe, the need for integrated water resource management (IWRM) for mitigation, and the role of policies like carbon pricing mechanisms for reducing emissions. The experts also highlight the potential of drought-resistant crops and sustainable agriculture practices in enhancing resilience to drought conditions.\n\nThe panel discussion reveals cross-disciplinary connections, such as how climate models inform policy decisions regarding emissions reductions and how hydrological management and agricultural adaptation are crucial for reducing drought impacts. Historical drought events, like the Dust Bowl, provide valuable lessons for developing proactive strategies and policies to prevent future crises.\n\nEach expert recommends resources and contributes domain-specific search terms. Dr. Rossi suggests the EURO-CORDEX regional climate models and IPCC reports for detailed climate projections and assessments. Dr. Silva recommends resources on IWRM and efficient irrigation practices. Dr. M\u00fcller points to the UN Convention to Combat Desertification and research on carbon pricing mechanisms. Dr. McGregor suggests historical accounts of the Dust Bowl and other significant drought events. Dr. Lorenzo recommends research articles on drought-resistant crops and sustainable agriculture practices.\n\nSynthesizing these insights, I prioritize terms that add new dimensions to the search, such as \"EURO-CORDEX,\" \"RCP scenarios,\" \"Shared Socioeconomic Pathways,\" \"IWRM,\" \"drought-resistant crops,\" \"sustainable agriculture,\" \"climate change mitigation,\" and \"climate change adaptation.\" These terms, along with the experts' recommendations, form the basis of an expanded query that captures both the explicit and implicit aspects of the user's concern.\n\nThrough this process of applying the \"Query Expansion via Multi-Disciplinary Expert Panel\" technique and exploring related threads, I believe the terms identified would be most effective for a BM25 index. They reflect a nuanced understanding of the query, balancing the need for specific climate projections with the broader implications for policy, agriculture, and historical context.",
