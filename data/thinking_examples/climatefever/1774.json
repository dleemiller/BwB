British meteorologist Luke Howard was a major researcher within this field , establishing a cloud classification system .   While this branch of meteorology still exists today , the term nephology , or nephologist is rarely used . The term came into use at the end of the nineteenth century , and fell out of common use by the middle of the twentieth .  Recently , interest in nephology ( if not the name ) has surged as many meteorologists have begun to focus on the relationship between clouds and global warming .   Since the late 1990s , some have suggested that when high solar activity lowers levels of cosmic rays , that in turn reduces cloud cover and warms the planet . Others say that there is no statistical evidence for such an effect .   Some nephologists believe that an increase in global temperature could decrease the thickness and brightness ( ability to reflect light energy ) , which would further increase global temperature . Recently research has been going on at CERN 's CLOUD facility to study the effects of the solar cycle and cosmic rays on cloud formation .\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: Cosmics Leaving Outdoor Droplets or CLOUD is an experiment being run at CERN by a group of researchers led by Jasper Kirkby to investigate the microphysics between galactic cosmic rays ( GCRs ) and aerosols under controlled conditions . The experiment began operation in November 2009 .   The primary goal is to understand the influence of galactic cosmic rays ( GCRs ) on aerosols and clouds , and their implications for climate . Although its design is optimised to address the cosmic ray question , ( as posed by Henrik Svensmark and colleagues in 1997 ) CLOUD allows as well to measure aerosol nucleation and growth under controlled laboratory conditions . Atmospheric aerosols and their effect on clouds are recognised by the IPCC as main source of uncertainty in present radiative forcing and climate models .\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: Atmospheric electricity is the study of electrical charges in the Earth 's atmosphere ( or that of another planet ) . The movement of charge between the Earth 's surface , the atmosphere , and the ionosphere is known as the global atmospheric electrical circuit . Atmospheric electricity is an interdisciplinary topic , involving concepts from electrostatics , atmospheric physics , meteorology and Earth science .   Thunderstorms act as a giant battery in the atmosphere , charging up the ionosphere to about 400,000 volts with respect to the surface . This sets up an electric field throughout the atmosphere , which decreases with increase in altitude . Atmospheric ions created by cosmic rays and natural radioactivity move in the electric field , so a very small current flows through the atmosphere , even away from thunderstorms . Near the surface of the earth , the magnitude of the field is around 100 V/m .   Atmospheric electricity involves both thunderstorms , which create lightning bolts to rapidly discharge huge amounts of atmospheric charge stored in storm clouds , and the continual electrification of the air due to ionization from cosmic rays and natural radioactivity , which ensure that the atmosphere is never quite neutral .\n",
  "thought_process": "As I delve into the query about the CERN CLOUD experiment and its implications for global warming, my initial thoughts revolve around the complexities of climate change and the role of cosmic rays. The user's query suggests a need to understand the specific findings of the CERN CLOUD experiment in relation to the requirements for blaming global warming on cosmic rays. This immediately brings to mind the multifaceted nature of climate science, where various factors, including solar activity, aerosol formation, and cloud nucleation, play crucial roles.\n\nAnalyzing the results from the original query, I notice that the top documents touch on the CERN CLOUD experiment, its objectives, and the broader context of nephology\u2014the study of clouds and cloud formation. The mention of cosmic rays and their potential influence on cloud cover and global temperature stands out, as it directly pertains to the user's query. However, I also recognize the need to consider the diverse backgrounds and expertise levels of potential users, from novices seeking basic information to experts looking for detailed analysis and methodology.\n\nTo expand the query effectively, I decide to employ the technique of User Intent and Journey Mapping. This involves creating personas for different user types, analyzing their search vocabulary, mapping their information journey, identifying contextual scenarios, and extracting intent-based terms. By doing so, I aim to capture the breadth of possible search terms and intents that users might have when exploring the relationship between the CERN CLOUD experiment, cosmic rays, and global warming.\n\nStarting with user personas, I envision a novice user who might begin with general terms like \"cosmic rays climate change\" or \"CERN experiment global warming.\" In contrast, an advanced user or an expert might use more specific terms such as \"CERN CLOUD experiment requirements,\" \"aerosol nucleation cosmic rays,\" or even technical terms related to cloud chamber measurements or primary cosmic ray composition.\n\nAs I map the information journey, I consider how users progress from awareness to expertise. Initially, they might ask broad questions about the causes of climate change or the role of cosmic rays in weather phenomena. As they delve deeper, their queries could become more specific, focusing on the CERN CLOUD experiment's findings, the impact of aerosols on clouds, or the statistical significance of the experiment's results.\n\nThe technique also involves analyzing contextual scenarios where users might need this information, such as problem-solving, learning, decision-making, or practical applications. This step helps in identifying a wide range of potential search terms and intents, from understanding natural versus human factors in climate change to developing models for cloud formation based on CERN CLOUD data.\n\nBy systematically applying this technique and interspersing it with natural thought patterns, I find myself occasionally reconsidering initial assumptions or making intuitive connections between different concepts. For instance, the realization that the CERN CLOUD experiment's findings on aerosol nucleation could have significant implications for understanding cloud formation and, by extension, global warming, prompts me to consider related terms and concepts that might not have been immediately apparent.\n\nThrough this process of applying the User Intent and Journey Mapping technique and exploring related threads, I believe the most effective terms for expanding the query would include a combination of general and specific terms related to the CERN CLOUD experiment, cosmic rays, cloud formation, aerosol nucleation, and global warming. These terms would capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, providing a comprehensive overview of the topic.\n\nIn synthesizing the insights gained, I conclude that the expanded query should indeed reflect the diverse needs and intents of potential users, from basic information seekers to advanced researchers. By incorporating terms that reflect the user's journey from awareness to expertise and considering various scenarios and intents, the expanded query can better serve the needs of a wide range of users interested in the CERN CLOUD experiment and its implications for our understanding of global warming.",
