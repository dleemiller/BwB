  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: The Copenhagen Diagnosis is a report written by twenty-six climate scientists from eight countries . It was published in 2009 and was a summary of the peer-reviewed literature to date .   The Copenhagen Diagnosis is a follow-up of the previous Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 's Working Group 1 Report . The studies summarized , which date back to the cutoff point of the Working Group 1 Report , are those that authors viewed most relevant to the discussions at the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference . ...\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: A sea level rise is an increase in the volume of water in the world 's oceans , resulting in an increase in global mean sea level . Sea level rise is usually attributed to global climate change by thermal expansion of the water in the oceans and by melting of Ice sheets and glaciers on land . Melting of floating ice shelves or icebergs at sea raises sea levels only slightly .   Sea level rise at specific locations may be more or less than the global average . Local factors might include tectonic effects , subsidence of the land , tides , currents , storms , etc. .  Sea level rise is expected to continue for centuries . Because of the slow inertia , long response time for parts of the climate system , it has been estimated that we are already committed to a sea-level rise of approximately 2.3 m for each degree Celsius of temperature rise within the next 2,000 years . IPCC Summary for Policymakers , AR5 , 2014 , indicated that the global mean sea level rise will continue during the 21st century , very likely at a faster rate than observed from 1971 to 2010 . Projected rates and amounts vary . A January 2017 NOAA report suggests a range of GMSL rise of 0.3 -- 2.5 m possible during the 21st century .   Sea level rises can considerably influence human populations in coastal and island regions and natural environments like marine ecosystems .\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: Deglaciation describes the transition from full glacial conditions during ice ages , to warm interglacials , characterized by global warming and sea level rise due to change in continental ice volume ( IPCC AR5 ) . Thus , it refers to the retreat of a glacier , an ice sheet or frozen surface layer , and the resulting exposure of the Earth 's surface . The decline of the cryosphere due to ablation can occur on any scale from global to localized to a particular glacier . After the Last Glacial Maximum ( ca. 21k years ago ) , the last deglaciation begun , which lasted until the early Holocene .   The previous deglaciation took place between approximately 22ka until 11.5 ka . This occurred when there was an annual mean atmospheric temperature on the earth that increased by roughly 5 \u00b0 C , which was also accompanied by regional high-latitude warming that exceeded 10 \u00b0 C . This was also followed by noteworthy deep-sea and tropical-se warming , between about 1-2 \u00b0 C ( deep-sea ) and 2-4 \u00b0 C ( tropical sea ) . Not only did this warming occur , but the global hydrological budget also experienced noticeable changes and regional precipitation patters changed . As a result of all of this , the worlds main ice sheets , including the ones located in Eurasia , North America and parts of the Antarctic Ice Sheets melted . As a consequence , sea levels rose roughly 120 metres ) . These processes did not occur steadily , and they also did not occur at the same time .\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"Sea level rise is now increasing faster than predicted due to unexpectedly rapid ice melting,\" this makes me think of the complex interplay between climate change, ice sheet dynamics, and ocean currents. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the implications of this rapid ice melting on global sea levels and the potential consequences for coastal communities, I'm not sure yet how to tease out the most relevant information.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the top documents discuss the Copenhagen Diagnosis, sea level rise, and deglaciation. These text snippets provide a good starting point, but I need to dig deeper to identify the key factors contributing to the accelerated ice melting. The initial results highlight the importance of considering multiple factors, including thermal expansion, melting of ice sheets and glaciers, and local factors like tectonic effects and subsidence.\n\nTo approach this query expansion systematically, I'll use the multi-disciplinary expert panel technique. This involves convening a panel of experts from diverse disciplines, such as glaciology, oceanography, climate modeling, geology, and social science. Each expert will analyze the query from their unique perspective, identifying key concepts, methodologies, and specialized vocabulary.\n\nAs I imagine the panel discussion, I start to see connections between the different disciplines. The glaciologist might focus on the dynamics of ice sheets and glaciers, while the oceanographer could explore the role of warming ocean waters in melting ice from below. The climate modeler would likely examine the impact of increasing greenhouse gas concentrations on polar amplification, and the geologist might investigate long-term geological factors influencing ice sheet behavior. The social scientist would consider the implications of sea level rise for public perception and policy responses.\n\nFollowing the multi-disciplinary expert panel technique, I'll compile the specialized terminology from each expert and identify terms with cross-disciplinary relevance. This should help me prioritize terms that add new dimensions to the search. I notice that terms like \"ice sheet dynamics,\" \"ocean currents,\" \"greenhouse gas concentrations,\" and \"polar amplification\" are relevant across multiple disciplines.\n\nAs I apply this technique, I'm reminded of the importance of considering both the explicit and implicit aspects of the user's query. The explicit aspect is the rapid ice melting and its contribution to sea level rise, while the implicit aspect is the potential consequences for coastal communities and the need for effective climate mitigation strategies.\n\nThrough this process, I've started to see how the structured approach of the multi-disciplinary expert panel technique can be balanced with natural cognitive patterns. I've had moments of reconsideration, such as realizing the need to include geological factors in the analysis, and intuitive connections, like recognizing the interplay between ocean currents and ice sheet dynamics.\n\nThe insights emerging from both the structure and intuition are helping me to identify the most relevant terms for the expanded query. I've realized that terms like \"glacial melt,\" \"sea level rise projections,\" and \"climate mitigation strategies\" are crucial for capturing the essence of the user's query.\n\nIn synthesizing the insights, I believe that the following terms would be most effective for a BM25 index: \"ice sheet dynamics,\" \"ocean currents,\" \"greenhouse gas concentrations,\" \"polar amplification,\" \"glacial melt,\" \"sea level rise projections,\" \"climate mitigation strategies,\" and \"IPCC assessments.\" These terms capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, and they reflect the interplay between different disciplines and factors contributing to the accelerated ice melting.",
