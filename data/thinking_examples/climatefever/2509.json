  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: The Pacific Decadal Oscillation ( PDO ) is a robust , recurring pattern of ocean-atmosphere climate variability centered over the mid-latitude Pacific basin . The PDO is detected as warm or cool surface waters in the Pacific Ocean , north of 20 \u00b0 N. Over the past century , the amplitude of this climate pattern has varied irregularly at interannual-to-interdecadal time scales ( meaning time periods of a few years to as much as time periods of multiple decades ) . There is evidence of reversals in the prevailing polarity ( meaning changes in cool surface waters versus warm surface waters within the region ) of the oscillation occurring around 1925 , 1947 , and 1977 ; the last two reversals corresponded with dramatic shifts in salmon production regimes in the North Pacific Ocean . ...\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: The WECT Tower was a 1905 ft - tall mast used as antenna for TV-broadcasting , including broadcasting the analog television signal of WECT channel 6 . It was built in 1969 and was situated along NC 53 south of White Lake in Colly Township in Bladen County , North Carolina , United States . Before demolition , WECT Tower was , along with several other masts , the seventh tallest man-made structure ever created ; and was not only the tallest structure in North Carolina , but also the tallest in the United States east of the Mississippi River .   On September 8 , 2008 , WECT ceased regular transmission of their analog signal from the Bladen County tower , relying instead on its newer digital transmitter in Winnabow . Following the switch , the analog signal remained on air until the end of September as a `` Nightlight '' , broadcasting an instructional video explaining installation of converters and UHF antennas , but many who were able to receive WECT 's former VHF analog signal would no longer be able to receive the station at all digitally , due to a shift to a UHF channel and a vastly smaller coverage area .   WECT continued to utilize the former analog tower for electronic news-gathering purposes before donating the tower and 77 acre site to the Green Beret Foundation in 2011 . On September 20 , 2012 , the tower was demolished to be scrapped . Proceeds from the sale of the land and the scrap metal of the tower will go to the foundation .\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: The Western Mediterranean oscillation ( WeMO or WeMOi ) is an index ( which varies over time with no particular periodicity ) measuring the difference between the standardized atmospheric pressure recorded at Padua ( 45.40 \u25e6 N , 11.48 \u25e6 E ) in northern Italy , and San Fernando , C\u00e1diz ( 36.28 \u25e6 N , 6.12 \u25e6 W ) in Southwestern Spain . Whereas Padua is an area with a relatively high barometric variability due to the influence of the central European anticyclone , San Fernando is often under the influence of the Azores High .   This new , more local , teleconnection was initially proposed by researches in the Climatology Group at the University of Barcelona as an alternative to the widely known NAO for studying the variability in rainfall in eastern Spain , in regions such as Catalonia , Valencia , and Murcia .   The WeMOi barometric pattern is believed by climatologists to be causally related to , and thus partially predictive of , rainfall variability on the eastern side of the Iberian Peninsula . ...\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"In 1905, PDO switched to a warm phase,\" this makes me think of climate patterns and significant events in history. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the implications of this phase shift or how it relates to broader climate trends, the initial query seems to focus on identifying the year this event occurred and possibly understanding what the \"warm phase\" means in the context of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). \n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query to point out strengths and weaknesses of the search terms, it's clear that the query lacks specificity regarding the type of information sought (e.g., causes, effects, climate implications). The results provide some insight into the PDO and its variability but don't directly address the user's query about the 1905 event. The text snippets from documents at various positions show a mix of relevant and irrelevant information, with the most relevant snippet discussing the PDO's variability and phase changes, but not specifically mentioning the 1905 event.\n\nTransitioning to a structured approach, I'll apply the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal technique, which involves constructing a conceptual graph and traversing it to find high-value expansion terms. This should help because it systematically explores related concepts and terms that could improve the query's specificity and retrieval effectiveness.\n\nFirst, I identify the core concepts and entities in the original query: the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), the year 1905, and the term \"warm phase.\" The search intent appears to be informational, with the user seeking specific details about a historical climate event. There are implicit assumptions about the relevance of the PDO's phase shift in 1905 to broader climate patterns or events.\n\nConstructing the conceptual graph, the core nodes include \"PDO,\" \"1905,\" and \"warm phase.\" First-order connections involve the properties and attributes of these concepts, such as the geographical area affected by the PDO (North Pacific), the characteristics of a \"warm phase\" (increased temperatures, specific climate indices), and the historical context of 1905 (other significant climate events or patterns around that time). Second-order connections might include related climate phenomena (El Ni\u00f1o, La Ni\u00f1a), the impact of the PDO on regional climate patterns, or the methodologies used to study and predict the PDO's phases.\n\nFor expansion path selection, promising directions include synonymous terms (e.g., \"Pacific climate variability\" for PDO), hierarchical terms (broader: \"climate oscillations,\" narrower: \"North Pacific Oscillation\"), compositional terms (components of the PDO, such as \"sea surface temperature anomalies\"), contextual terms (settings where the PDO has significant impacts, such as \"salmon production regimes\"), and domain-specific terminology (climate indices used to define the \"warm phase\").\n\nExtracting and filtering terms, I consider relevance, distinctiveness, specificity, and searchability. Relevant terms might include \"North Pacific climate variability,\" \"sea surface temperature anomalies,\" \"climate indices,\" and \"interdecadal variability.\" These terms are distinctive in that they add new facets to the query without merely repeating existing terms, and they are specific enough to potentially retrieve targeted information about the PDO's warm phase in 1905.\n\nAs I apply the technique and explore related concepts, I realize that the process is not just about mechanically adding terms but about understanding how they connect to the original query's intent. For instance, considering the \"warm phase\" in the context of the PDO leads me to think about how this phase shift might be defined using specific climate indices or how it correlate with other climate phenomena.\n\nThrough this process of applying Conceptual Graph Traversal and exploring related threads, I believe terms like \"Pacific Decadal Oscillation,\" \"warm phase,\" \"1905,\" \"climate records,\" \"North Pacific Gyre,\" and possibly \"interdecadal variability\" or \"sea surface temperature anomalies\" would be most effective for query expansion. They capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, balancing the need for specificity with the breadth of relevant climate information.\n\nThe final step involves synthesizing these insights into an augmented query that effectively balances structure and intuition. By incorporating terms that reflect the PDO's context, the definition of its \"warm phase,\" and the historical context of 1905, the query can be more accurately targeted towards retrieving relevant climate records and information about the North Pacific Gyre, thus enhancing the search results' relevance and usefulness for the user.",
