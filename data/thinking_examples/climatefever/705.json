  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: Following the development of Keynesian economics , applied economics began developing forecasting models based on economic data including national income and product accounting data . In contrast with typical textbook models , these large-scale macroeconometric models used large amounts of data and based forecasts on past correlations instead of theoretical relations . These models estimated the relations between different macroeconomic variables using regression analysis on time series data . These models grew to include hundreds or thousands of equations describing the evolution of hundreds or thousands of prices and quantities over time , making computers essential for their solution . While the choice of which variables to include in each equation was partly guided by economic theory ( for example , including past income as a determinant of consumption , as suggested by the theory of adaptive expectations ) , variable inclusion was mostly determined on purely empirical grounds . Large-scale macroeconometric model consists of systems of dynamic equations of the economy with the estimation of parameters using time-series data on a quarterly to yearly basis .   Macroeconometric models have a supply and a demand side for estimation of these parameters . Kydland and Prescott call it the system of equations approach . Large-scale macroeconometric model can be defined as a set of stochastic equations with definitional and institutional relationships denoting the behaviour of economic agents . ...\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: An atmospheric model is a mathematical model constructed around the full set of primitive dynamical equations which govern atmospheric motions . It can supplement these equations with parameterizations for turbulent diffusion , radiation , moist processes ( clouds and precipitation ) , heat exchange , soil , vegetation , surface water , the kinematic effects of terrain , and convection . Most atmospheric models are numerical , i.e. they discretize equations of motion . They can predict microscale phenomena such as tornadoes and boundary layer eddies , sub-microscale turbulent flow over buildings , as well as synoptic and global flows . The horizontal domain of a model is either global , covering the entire Earth , or regional ( limited-area ) , covering only part of the Earth . The different types of models run are thermotropic , barotropic , hydrostatic , and nonhydrostatic . Some of the model types make assumptions about the atmosphere which lengthens the time steps used and increases computational speed .   Forecasts are computed using mathematical equations for the physics and dynamics of the atmosphere . These equations are nonlinear and are impossible to solve exactly . ...\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: Parameterization in a weather or climate model within numerical weather prediction is a method of replacing processes that are too small-scale or complex to be physically represented in the model by a simplified process . This can be contrasted with other processes -- e.g. , large-scale flow of the atmosphere -- that are explicitly resolved within the models . Associated with these parameterizations are various parameters used in the simplified processes . Examples include the descent rate of raindrops , convective clouds , simplifications of the atmospheric radiative transfer on the basis of atmospheric radiative transfer codes , and cloud microphysics . Radiative parameterizations are important to both atmospheric and oceanic modeling alike . Atmospheric emissions from different sources within individual grid boxes also need to be parameterized to determine their impact on air quality .\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"policies based on previous climate model output and predictions might need to be reconsidered,\" this makes me think of how climate policies are formulated and the critical role that climate models play in informing these decisions. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the implications of outdated climate models on existing policies, it seems like they're hinting at a broader issue of policy adaptability in the face of evolving climate science.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the initial search results are too broad, touching on climate models, general policy responses, but not specifically addressing policies that were formed based on previous climate model outputs and are now facing scrutiny. The text snippets from the documents at k=1, k=2, and k=10 provide insight into economic and atmospheric modeling, highlighting the complexity and the continuous evolution of these models. This suggests that policies based on older models might indeed require reassessment as new data and methodologies become available.\n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here, but let me approach this using the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal technique, which involves constructing a conceptual graph based on the core concepts and entities in the query, and then traversing it to find high-value expansion terms. This should help because it systematically identifies relevant terms and concepts that can refine the search query, making it more precise and targeted towards the user's intent.\n\nFollowing the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal approach, I should first identify the core concepts and entities in the original query. Here, the core concepts revolve around \"climate policies,\" \"previous climate model output,\" and \"predictions.\" Determining the search intent, it seems informational, aiming to find specific examples of policies and their effectiveness or need for revision based on updated climate data.\n\nConstructing the conceptual graph, I would include nodes for climate policies, climate models, predictions, and policy reconsideration. First-order connections would involve the relationships between these concepts, such as how climate models inform policy decisions. Second-order connections could include related concepts like the impact of policy decisions on climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies.\n\nFor expansion path selection, I would consider synonymous terms, such as \"climate change predictions\" for \"predictions,\" and hierarchical terms, like \"regional climate policies\" for \"climate policies.\" Compositional terms could include \"policy frameworks\" or \"modeling techniques,\" and contextual terms might involve \"socio-economic factors\" or \"environmental impact assessments.\"\n\nAs I extract and filter terms, I'm looking for relevance, distinctiveness, specificity, and searchability. Terms like \"policy revision,\" \"model uncertainty,\" \"outdated models,\" and \"robust decision-making\" seem promising as they directly address the potential issues with policies based on previous climate model outputs and the need for adaptation or revision.\n\nHowever, I also want to consider the natural thought process that complements this structured technique. For instance, thinking about policy revision leads me to consider the challenges in implementing changes, which in turn reminds me of the importance of stakeholder engagement and public perception. This intuitive connection suggests that terms related to \"stakeholder analysis\" or \"public policy engagement\" could also be valuable.\n\nReflecting on the process, I realize that applying the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal technique has not only helped in systematically identifying relevant terms but has also facilitated a deeper understanding of the complexities involved in policymaking based on climate models. The technique's structured approach ensures that the expansion terms are closely related to the original query, while my natural thought patterns and intuitions have allowed for the inclusion of terms that might not have been immediately apparent through the technique alone.\n\nThrough this process of applying the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal technique and exploring related threads, I believe the terms \"policies,\" \"climate model output,\" \"climate predictions,\" \"policy revision,\" \"policy reassessment,\" \"policy adaptation failure,\" \"model uncertainty,\" \"outdated models,\" and \"robust decision-making\" would be most effective for a BM25 index. These terms capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, from the specific focus on climate policies and models to the broader implications of policy revision and the challenges of decision-making under uncertainty.",
