  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: Ice2sea is a program of scientific research funded by the European Union 's Framework 7 Programme to study the effects of climate change on glaciation and the melting of ice caps and glaciers on sea level . The ice2sea project , a collaborative of 24 research institutions , which is headed by Prof David Vaughan , aims to reduce the uncertainty in sea-level projections which are of great economic and social importance to the European Union , especially as large areas of coastal area in Europe are below or less than a metre above sea level .   The 2007 fourth Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) report highlighted ice sheets * as the most significant remaining uncertainty in projections of sea-level rise . Understanding about the crucial ice-sheet effects was `` too limited to assess their likelihood or provide a best estimate of an upper bound for sea-level rise '' .   Improved scientific results from ice2sea will feed directly into the fifth IPCC report ( due in 2013 ) to generate more accurate sea-level rise projections .   The initiative recently funded research by scientists from the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in Germany , which was published in Nature in 2012 , which predicts the disappearance of the 450000 km2 vast Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf in east Antarctica by the end of the century which could add up to 4.4 mm of rise of sea level each year due to its melting alone .\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: The rate of global mean sea-level rise ( ~ 3 mm/yr ; SLR ) has accelerated compared to the mean of the 20th century ( ~ 2 mm/yr ) , but the rate of rise is locally variable . Factors contributing to SLR include decreased global ice volume and warming of the ocean . On Greenland , the deficiency between annual ice gained and lost tripled between 1996 and 2007 . On Antarctica the deficiency increased by 75 % . Mountain glaciers are retreating and the cumulative mean thickness change has accelerated from about \u2212 1.8 to \u2212 4 m in 1965 to 1970 to about \u2212 12 to \u2212 14 m in the first decade of the 21st century . From 1961 to 2003 , ocean temperatures to a depth of 700 m increased and portions of the deeper ocean are warming .   The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( 2007 ) projected sea level would reach 0.18 to 0.59 m above present by the end of the 21st century but lacked an estimate of ice flow dynamics calving . Calving was added by Pfeffer et al. ( 2008 ) indicating 0.8 to 2 m of SLR by 2100 ( favouring the low end of this range ) . Rahmstorf ( 2007 ) estimated SLR will reach 0.5 to 1.4 m by the end of the century . Pielke ( 2008 ) points out that observed SLR has exceeded the best case projections thus far . These approximations and others indicate that global mean SLR may reach 1 m by the end of this century . However , sea level is highly variable and planners considering local impacts must take this variability into account .\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: Climate inertia describes the widespread inherent characteristic of the climate , ecological , and socio-economic systems . Inertia from anthropogenic impacts may be slow to become apparent , or could be irreversible if climate change crosses associated thresholds . Melting ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica take time to respond to the emissions of fossil fuel carbon in the climate system . The global warming also causes thermal inertia , thermal expansion of the oceans , which contributes to sea level rise . It has been estimated that we are already committed to a sea-level rise of approximately 2.3 meters for each degree of temperature rise within the next 2,000 years .\n",
  "thought_process": "As I delve into the task of expanding the search query related to Greenland's ice loss and its contribution to sea level rise, I find myself initially pondering the complexity of the topic. The original query, \"Greenland's ice loss is accelerating & will add metres of sea level rise in upcoming centuries,\" seems straightforward but hints at a myriad of underlying factors and potential user intents. My first instinct is to consider who might be searching for this information and why. Are they students looking for basic concepts, scientists seeking detailed research findings, or perhaps policymakers needing data to inform environmental regulations?\n\nI decide to employ the query expansion technique via user intent and journey mapping. This approach involves creating distinct user personas, analyzing their search vocabulary, mapping their information journey, identifying contextual scenarios, and extracting intent-based terms. By doing so, I aim to augment the query with terms that reflect a broad spectrum of user needs and intents.\n\nLet's start with user persona creation. I envision four personas: the Eco-Conscious Novice, the Policy Maker Intermediate, the Climate Scientist Advanced, and the NGO Leader Expert. Each persona has unique goals, motivations, and levels of prior knowledge. The novice might be looking for simple explanations of Greenland's ice melt and its effects on sea level rise, while the expert could be seeking the latest scientific studies and data to inform policy or research.\n\nAs I analyze the search vocabulary for each persona, I notice patterns. The novice might use general terms like \"Greenland ice loss\" or \"sea level rise,\" while the intermediate user might search for \"IPCC reports on glacier dynamics\" or \"NOAA projections for sea level rise.\" The advanced user could be looking for specific terms like \"ice sheet dynamics,\" \"climate change effects on polar regions,\" or \"future projections of sea level rise.\"\n\nThe information journey mapping reveals how users progress from basic understanding to advanced knowledge. It starts with introductory questions about ice loss and sea level rise, moves through intermediate learning about scientific projections and climate change impacts, and culminates in advanced insights into glacier dynamics, ice sheet melting trends, and the integration of this knowledge into policy or research.\n\nConsidering the contextual scenarios where users need this information, I think about a student researching for a school project, a government official preparing for an international climate summit, a scientist conducting research on polar ice dynamics, or an NGO strategist developing educational materials. Each scenario highlights different aspects of the query that need expansion.\n\nAs I extract intent-based terms, I focus on vocabulary that reflects the diverse needs and intents of these users. Terms like \"global warming,\" \"climate change effects,\" \"IPCC report sea level rise,\" and \"Greenland ice melt consequences\" emerge as crucial. These terms not only capture the essence of the original query but also encompass the broader contexts and user intents.\n\nThrough this process, I realize that expanding a search query is not just about adding more keywords but about understanding the complex landscape of user needs and intents. It requires balancing structured techniques with natural thought patterns, allowing for false starts, reconsiderations, and tangents that can lead to unexpected insights.\n\nThe final augmented query, \"Greenland's ice loss is accelerating & will add meters of sea level rise in upcoming centuries. Key impacts, scientific projections, IPCC and NOAA reports on glacier dynamics and climate change effects,\" reflects this approach. It includes terms that cater to various user personas, intents, and contexts, ensuring that the search results will be relevant and useful across a wide spectrum of users.\n\nIn conclusion, the thought process behind expanding a search query involves a deep understanding of user intents, a systematic approach to mapping their information journey, and the ability to balance structure with intuition. By embracing this complexity and integrating it into the query expansion process, we can create search queries that are not only comprehensive but also reflective of how real users think and seek information.",
