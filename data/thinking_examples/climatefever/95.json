Hurricane Harvey ( 1981 ) - threatened Bermuda but turned away before striking , no damage .  Hurricane Harvey ( 1993 ) - short-lived storm that threatened no land .  Tropical Storm Harvey ( 1999 ) - struck Florida , causing $ 15 million in damage .  Tropical Storm Harvey ( 2005 ) - earliest eighth-storm formation in the Atlantic Ocean since record-keeping began , breaking the old record set in 1936 by 12 days . Threatened Bermuda .  Tropical Storm Harvey ( 2011 ) - record eighth-storm failing to reach hurricane strength , in a single season , since reliable records began . Strong tropical storm that affected parts of Central America .   Category : Atlantic hurricane disambiguation pages\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n... Along its path , Harvey dropped heavy rainfall across much of Central America . Strong winds and heavy precipitation were reported in the country of Belize . Heavy rains in Mexico triggered numerous landslides , one of which killed 3 people . Landslides in damaged 36 homes and 334 homes in the states of Chiapas and Veracruz , respectively . Heavy rainfall also caused rivers to overflow , damaging homes and businesses . Two additional people died in Mexico from unknown causes .\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n... There are debates about the best policy responses to the science , their cost-effectiveness and their urgency . Climate scientists , especially in the United States , have reported official and oil-industry pressure to censor or suppress their work and hide scientific data , with directives not to discuss the subject in public communications . Legal cases regarding global warming , its effects , and measures to reduce it have reached American courts . The fossil fuels lobby has been identified as overtly or covertly supporting efforts to undermine or discredit the scientific consensus on global warming .\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query about the link between climate change and Hurricane Harvey based on climate scientists' opinions, this makes me think of the complexity of attributing specific weather events to broader climate trends. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the personal impact of such events or seeking validation for their concerns about climate change, it's also possible they're looking for expert opinions or practical advice on preparation. Hmm, not sure yet, but it seems like we're dealing with a mix of scientific inquiry, personal concern, and perhaps a bit of skepticism.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the initial returns are somewhat generic, discussing past hurricanes named Harvey and their effects, but not directly addressing the query's focus on climate change. Strengths of the search terms include their clarity and specificity, but weaknesses lie in their lack of nuance and inability to capture the full scope of the user's potential questions, such as personal experiences, debates, and specific impacts.\n\nLet me approach this using the Query Expansion via Community Q&A Patterns technique, which involves reframing the query into various question types, identifying hidden motivations behind the query, categorizing valuable response archetypes, mapping community interaction patterns, and extracting relevant vocabulary from conversational contexts. This should help because it allows us to simulate how the query would evolve in a community setting, capturing a broader range of relevant information and perspectives.\n\nFollowing the technique, I first reframe the query into different question types. For personal experience questions, we have \"What is it like to live through a hurricane that has been influenced by climate change?\" For advice-seeking, \"How should I prepare for hurricanes in the context of global warming?\" Opinion-based questions could include \"What do climate scientists think is the link between Hurricane Harvey and climate change?\" Comparison questions might ask \"Which is more significant in causing damage, the storm surge from hurricanes or the increased rainfall associated with climate change?\" And story-soliciting questions could be \"Has anyone experienced both a pre-climate change hurricane and a recent one, and if so, what differences did they notice?\"\n\nIdentifying hidden motivations, I consider that the user might be seeking validation of their concerns about climate change, support for making decisions about disaster preparedness, access to expert opinions on complex scientific data, understanding of how climate change affects future hurricanes, or emotional support to cope with the fear of weather events exacerbated by global warming.\n\nLooking at answer archetypes, valuable responses would include first-hand accounts of living through Hurricane Harvey and perceived effects of climate change, expert analyses explaining the scientific links, practical guides on preparing for extreme weather, alternative viewpoints debating the role of climate change, and explanations of how climate change could have affected Harvey in multiple ways.\n\nConsidering community interactions, typical follow-up questions might include what specific aspects of Harvey were worsened by climate change, the accuracy of attributing single events to global warming, concerns about other natural disasters, the basis for knowing climate change is the cause and not natural variation, and the accuracy of climate models in predicting increased hurricane severity.\n\nExtracting vocabulary from conversational contexts, terms like \"freak weather,\" \"storm surge,\" \"ocean warming,\" \"extreme weather events,\" \"climate crisis,\" \"sea level rise,\" \"global warming impact,\" \"affected families,\" \"climate resilience,\" and \"ecological damage\" are relevant. These terms reflect how people discuss climate change and its impacts in informal settings, which can enhance our search by making it more relatable and inclusive of community concerns.\n\nApplying the technique step by step, I notice that the process reveals not just straightforward queries but a web of related concerns, questions, and themes that people might explore when discussing the link between Hurricane Harvey and climate change. This systematic approach, combined with an understanding of natural cognitive patterns such as reconsiderations, intuitive leaps, and tangents, helps to ensure that the final expanded query terms are both logically derived from the technique and resonant with how people actually think and discuss these topics.\n\nThrough this process of applying the Query Expansion via Community Q&A Patterns technique and exploring related threads, I believe the terms that would be most effective for a BM25 index include those from the expanded query: \"hurricane harvey climate change climate scientists link extreme weather storm surge global warming impact affected families.\" These terms capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, reflecting a nuanced understanding of the topic that balances structured technique with natural cognitive patterns.",
