  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: The standard measuring conditions for temperature are in the air , 1.5 meters above the ground , and shielded from direct sunlight . The highest confirmed temperature on Earth recorded according to these measures was 56.7 C in Furnace Creek Ranch , California , located in the Death Valley desert in the United States , on July 10 , 1913 .   The former highest official temperature on Earth , held for 90 years by ` Aziziya , Libya , was de-certified by the WMO ( World Meteorological Organization ) in January 2012 as the record for the world 's highest surface temperature ( this temperature of 57.8 \u00b0 C ( 136 \u00b0 F ) , registered on 13 September 1922 , is currently considered to have been a recorder 's error ) . Christopher C. Burt , the weather historian writing for Weather Underground who shepherded the Libya reading 's 2012 disqualification , believes that the 1913 Death Valley reading is `` a myth '' , and is at least four or five degrees Fahrenheit too high , as do other weather historians Dr. Arnold Court and William Taylor Reid . Burt proposes that the highest reliably recorded temperature on Earth is still at Death Valley , but is instead 53.9 C recorded five times : 20 July 1960 , 18 July 1998 , 20 July 2005 , 7 July 2007 , and 30 June 2013 .   Temperatures measured directly on the ground may exceed air temperatures by 30 to 50 \u00b0 C . ...\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n... Particularly large differences between reconstructed temperature series occur at the few times when there is little temporal overlap between successive satellites , making intercalibration difficult .   To compare to the trend from the surface temperature record ( approximately +0.07 \u00b0 C/decade over the past century and +0.15 -0.16 \u00b0 C/decade since 1979 ) it is most appropriate to derive trends for the part of the atmosphere nearest the surface , i.e. , the lower troposphere . Doing this , through January 2012 :  RSS v3 .3 finds a trend of +0.137 \u00b0 C/decade .  UAH v5 .4 finds a trend of +0.136 \u00b0 C/decade .   An alternative adjustment introduced by Fu et al. ( 2004 ) finds trends ( 1979 -- 2011 ) of +0.14 \u00b0 C/decade when applied to the RSS data set and +0.11 \u00b0 C/decade when applied to the UAH data set .   Using the T2 channel ( which include significant contributions from the stratosphere , which has cooled ) , Mears et al. of Remote Sensing Systems ( RSS ) find ( through January 2012 ) a trend of +0.082 \u00b0 C/decade . ...\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: Astra is the brand name for a number of geostationary communication satellites , both individually and as a group , which are owned and operated by SES S.A. , a global satellite operator based in Betzdorf , in eastern Luxembourg . The name is also used to describe the pan-European broadcasting system provided by these satellites , the channels carried on them , and even the reception equipment .   At the time of the launch of the first Astra satellite , Astra 1A in 1988 , the satellite 's operator was known as Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne des Satellites . In 2001 SES Astra , a newly formed subsidiary of SES , operated the Astra satellites and in September 2011 , SES Astra was consolidated back into the parent company , which by this time also operated other satellite families such as AMC , and NSS .   Astra satellites broadcast 2,600 digital television channels ( 675 in high definition ) via five main satellite orbital positions to households across Europe and North Africa . The satellites have been instrumental in the establishment of satellite TV and the introduction of digital TV , HDTV , 3D TV , and HbbTV in Europe .   A book , High Above , telling the story of the creation and development of the Astra satellites and their contribution to developments in the European TV and media industry , was published in April 2010 to mark the 25th Anniversary of SES .\n",
  "thought_process": "As I reflect on the original query, \"Satellite temperature readings going back to 1979 show 1998 was by far the warmest year in the satellite era,\" my initial impressions are that this query is seeking specific, factual information about global temperature trends as recorded by satellites. The user is likely looking for data that confirms or denies the notion that 1998 was the warmest year since satellite temperature readings began. This query has a clear scientific basis and is focused on understanding climate change patterns.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the top documents provide information on the highest recorded temperatures on Earth, trends in lower troposphere temperatures, and details about satellite communication systems. While these documents offer some relevant information, they also highlight the need for a more targeted approach to retrieve documents specifically about satellite temperature readings and their implications for understanding climate change.\n\nTo expand this query effectively, I will apply the technique of Conceptual Graph Traversal. This involves constructing a conceptual graph with core nodes representing the main entities and concepts from the query, such as \"satellite temperature readings,\" \"warmest year,\" and \"climate change.\" The graph will also include first-order connections like properties and attributes of these concepts (e.g., \"global,\" \"since 1979\"), second-order connections to related concepts (e.g., \"greenhouse effect,\" \"global warming\"), and domain contexts (e.g., \"environmental science,\" \"meteorology\").\n\nAs I begin to traverse this graph, I identify several promising directions for query expansion:\n1. **Synonymous terms:** Using terms like \"global warming\" and \"climate trends\" to capture the broader context of the query.\n2. **Hierarchical terms:** Incorporating more specific terms like \"lower troposphere temperature\" to delve deeper into the details of satellite temperature readings.\n3. **Compositional terms:** Adding terms related to the composition of the Earth's atmosphere and how it affects temperature readings, such as \"ozone layer\" and \"atmospheric circulation.\"\n4. **Contextual terms:** Including terms that relate to the geopolitical and socioeconomic aspects of climate change, such as \"sustainable development\" and \"environmental policy.\"\n\nThrough this structured approach, complemented by natural cognitive patterns like reconsidering initial assumptions and making intuitive connections, I aim to derive a set of expansion terms that will enhance the query's ability to retrieve relevant documents. This process involves systematically applying the technique's steps while allowing for the flexibility to adjust based on insights gained during the analysis.\n\nFor example, as I explore the concept of \"satellite temperature readings,\" I realize the importance of specifying the timeframe (\"since 1979\") and the geographic scope (\"global\"). This leads me to consider terms like \"long-term climate trends\" and \"global temperature anomalies.\" The technique of Conceptual Graph Traversal helps in organizing these thoughts and in identifying how different concepts relate to each other, ensuring that the expansion terms are both relevant and distinctive.\n\nAs I proceed, I also consider the potential for false starts or the need to reassess certain paths. For instance, initially, I might focus heavily on the technical aspects of satellite temperature readings, only to realize later that incorporating terms related to climate change policy and societal impacts could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the user's information needs.\n\nThe insights emerging from this process include recognizing the importance of balancing technical specificity with contextual breadth. Applying the Conceptual Graph Traversal technique leads to the discovery of terms like \"climate change trends\" and \"global warming effects,\" which are directly relevant to understanding the warmest year in the satellite era. Meanwhile, my natural thought process encourages me to consider how these terms might be interconnected and how they can be weighted to optimize the query's effectiveness.\n\nIn synthesizing these findings, I conclude that the most effective expansion terms for the query will include a mix of technical, contextual, and policy-related terms. These terms should capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of the user's query, enhancing the retrieval of documents that provide a comprehensive understanding of satellite temperature readings and their implications for climate change.\n\nThe final expanded query, \"satellite temperature readings global since 1979 showing warmest year 1998 climate change trends,\" reflects the integration of structured technique and natural thought patterns. This query is designed to retrieve documents that not only confirm the warmest year in the satellite era but also provide insight into the broader trends and implications of global temperature changes.",
