  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: Climate change mitigation scenarios are possible futures in which global warming is reduced by deliberate actions , such as a comprehensive switch to energy sources other than fossil fuels . A typical mitigation scenario is constructed by selecting a long-range target , such as a desired atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) , and then fitting the actions to the target , for example by placing a cap on net global and national emissions of greenhouse gases .   An increase of global temperature by more than 2 \u00b0 C has come to be the majority definition of what would constitute intolerably dangerous climate change with efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 \u00b0 C above pre-industrial levels per the Paris Agreement . Some climate scientists are increasingly of the opinion that the goal should be a complete restoration of the atmosphere 's preindustrial condition , on the grounds that too protracted a deviation from those conditions will produce irreversible changes .\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n... The main negative feedback comes from the Stefan -- Boltzmann law , the amount of heat radiated from the Earth into space changes with the fourth power of the temperature of Earth 's surface and atmosphere .   Some observed and potential effects of global warming are positive feedbacks , which contribute directly to further global warming . The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 's ( IPCC ) Fourth Assessment Report states that `` Anthropogenic warming could lead to some effects that are abrupt or irreversible , depending upon the rate and magnitude of the climate change . ''\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n... Examples include high altitudes and unventilated , confined spaces .   The OSHA definition is arguably broad enough to include oxygen-deficient circumstances in the absence of `` airborne contaminants '' , as well as many other chemical , thermal , or pneumatic hazards to life or health ( e.g. , pure helium , super-cooled or super-heated air , hyperbaric or hypo-baric or submerged chambers , etc. ) . It also uses the broader term `` impair '' , rather than `` prevent '' , with respect to the ability to escape . For example , blinding but non-toxic smoke could be considered IDLH under the OSHA definition if it would impair the ability to escape a `` dangerous '' but not life-threatening atmosphere ( such as tear gas ) .   The OSHA definition is part of a legal standard , which is the minimum legal requirement . Users or employers are encouraged to apply proper judgment to avoid taking unnecessary risks , even if the only immediate hazard is `` reversible '' , such as temporary pain , disorientation , nausea , or non-toxic contamination .\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query about the temperature increase caused by doubling CO2 concentration, this makes me think of the complexity of climate change and how it's not just about CO2, but a multitude of factors including other greenhouse gases, solar radiation, and feedback mechanisms. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the specific impact of CO2 doubling, I sense there's a broader curiosity about how all these elements interact within the climate system. \n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the initial snippets provide a good foundation but lack depth in exploring the interplay between different forcings and feedbacks. The first snippet discusses climate change mitigation scenarios and the importance of limiting temperature increase, which is relevant but doesn't directly address the query's focus on CO2 doubling. The second snippet introduces the concept of feedbacks, both positive and negative, which is crucial for understanding the climate system's response to increased CO2 levels. However, it doesn't delve into the specifics of how these feedbacks quantitatively affect the temperature increase due to CO2 doubling. The tenth snippet seems somewhat off-topic, discussing IDLH (Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health) conditions, which, while important in its own right, doesn't contribute directly to our understanding of CO2's impact on global temperature.\n\nTo approach this query expansion systematically, I'll use the \"Query Expansion Through Journalistic Investigation\" technique. This involves treating the query as a story that needs to be fleshed out with real-world contexts, expert insights, and detailed information. The first step is query assessment, where I've already identified that the user is seeking a deeper understanding of how CO2 doubling affects temperature, considering other factors and feedback mechanisms.\n\nNext, I consider real-world contexts where this query is relevant, such as in climate science research, policy-making for climate change mitigation, and educational settings where students are learning about environmental science. This helps in understanding the practical applications and knowledge gaps that the expanded query needs to address.\n\nThe resource investigation phase involves looking into authoritative sources and expert opinions. For instance, the IPCC reports are a cornerstone for understanding climate change, including the effects of CO2 doubling. Notable experts in climate science, such as those involved in the development of climate models, can provide insights into the complex interactions within the climate system.\n\nCreating headlines for articles that could address the query from different angles helps in extracting specific terms related to the query. Headlines like \"CO2 Doubling: A Precise Look at Temperature Rise,\" \"Beyond CO2: Unpacking Other Drivers of Climate Change,\" and \"Climate Feedback Loops: Accelerating or Buffering Global Warming?\" suggest terms such as \"climate sensitivity,\" \"greenhouse gas effects,\" \"feedback mechanisms,\" and \"climate modeling.\"\n\nAs I apply the journalistic investigation technique, I find that my initial thoughts and the structured approach complement each other. The technique helps in systematically exploring the query, but my intuition and prior knowledge also play a role in making connections between different pieces of information. For example, recognizing the importance of feedback mechanisms in amplifying or mitigating the effects of CO2 doubling leads me to consider how these might be quantified and modeled, which in turn suggests looking into specific climate models and their predictions.\n\nThrough this process, insights emerge from both the structured technique and my natural thought patterns. Applying the technique leads to the discovery of specific terms and concepts, such as \"climate sensitivity\" and \"radiative forcing,\" which are crucial for understanding the impact of CO2 doubling. At the same time, my intuition and experience in the field help in making connections between these concepts and the broader context of climate change, ensuring that the expanded query captures the complexity and nuance of the topic.\n\nSynthesizing all this information, I believe the most effective terms for expanding the query would include those related to climate modeling, feedback mechanisms, and the specific effects of greenhouse gases. These terms, derived from both the systematic application of the journalistic investigation technique and my own cognitive patterns, should provide a comprehensive basis for understanding the temperature increase caused by doubling CO2 concentration, considering the influence of other forcings and feedback mechanisms on global warming.",
