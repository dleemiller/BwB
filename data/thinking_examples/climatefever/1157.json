  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: In macroeconomics , aggregate demand ( AD ) or domestic final demand ( DFD ) is the total demand for final goods and services in an economy at a given time . It specifies the amounts of goods and services that will be purchased at all possible price levels . This is the demand for the gross domestic product of a country . It is often called effective demand , though at other times this term is distinguished .   The aggregate demand curve is plotted with real output on the horizontal axis and the price level on the vertical axis . It is downward sloping as a result of three distinct effects : Pigou 's wealth effect , Keynes ' interest rate effect and the Mundell -- Fleming exchange-rate effect . The Pigou effect states that a higher price level implies lower real wealth and therefore lower consumption spending , giving a lower quantity of goods demanded in the aggregate . The Keynes effect states that a higher price level implies a lower real money supply and therefore higher interest rates resulting from financial market equilibrium , in turn resulting in lower investment spending on new physical capital and hence a lower quantity of goods being demanded in the aggregate .   The Mundell -- Fleming exchange-rate effect is an extension of the IS -- LM model . Whereas the traditional IS-LM Model deals with a closed economy , Mundell -- Fleming describes a small open economy . ...\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: Economic growth is the increase in the inflation-adjusted market value of the goods and services produced by an economy over time . It is conventionally measured as the percent rate of increase in real gross domestic product , or real GDP , usually in per capita terms .   Growth is usually calculated in real terms -- i.e. , inflation-adjusted terms -- to eliminate the distorting effect of inflation on the price of goods produced . Measurement of economic growth uses national income accounting . Since economic growth is measured as the annual percent change of gross domestic product ( GDP ) , it has all the advantages and drawbacks of that measure .   The `` rate of economic growth '' refers to the geometric annual rate of growth in GDP between the first and the last year over a period of time . Implicitly , this growth rate is the trend in the average level of GDP over the period , which implicitly ignores the fluctuations in the GDP around this trend .   An increase in economic growth caused by more efficient use of inputs ( such as labor productivity , physical capital , energy or materials ) is referred to as intensive growth . GDP growth caused only by increases in the amount of inputs available for use ( increased population , new territory ) is called extensive growth .\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: Dairy farming is one of the largest agricultural sectors in Canada . Dairy has a significant presence in all of the provinces and is one of the top two agricultural commodities in seven out of ten provinces .   In 2016 , there were 959,600 dairy cows on 11,683 farms across the country . Quebec and Ontario are the major dairy producing provinces with 49 % and 33 % of the farms , respectively . The Canadian dairy sector contributes roughly $ 18.9 B yearly to Canada 's GDP , and sustains approximately 215,000 full-time equivalent jobs .   In Canada , dairy farming is subject to the system of supply management . Under supply management , which also includes the egg and poultry sectors , farmers manage their production so that it coincides with forecasts of demand for their products over a predetermined period - while taking into account certain imports that enter Canada , as well as some production which is shipped to export markets . Imports of dairy , eggs , and poultry are controlled using tariff rate quotas , or TRQs . These allow a predetermined quantity to be imported at preferential tariff rates ( generally duty free ) , while maintaining control over how much is imported . The over-quota tariffs are set at levels that allow Canadian farmers to receive a price reflecting the cost to produce in a northern environment .\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"In 2013 the level of U.S. farm output was about 2.7 times its 1948 level, and productivity was growing at an average annual rate of 1.52%,\" this makes me think of the tremendous advancements in agricultural technology and practices over the years. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the factors behind this growth, I'm not sure yet what specific aspects they're interested in - whether it's the role of government policies, innovations in farming techniques, or perhaps the impact of global market trends on U.S. agricultural productivity.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the top documents discuss macroeconomic concepts like aggregate demand and economic growth, which, while relevant to understanding the broader context of agricultural productivity, don't directly address the query's focus on U.S. farm output and productivity growth. The document at k=10, however, touches on dairy farming in Canada, which, although not directly related to the U.S. context, hints at the importance of sector-specific analyses and the impact of supply management systems on agricultural productivity.\n\nTransitioning to a more structured approach, I'll use the Conceptual Territory Mapping technique. This involves creating a detailed map of the conceptual territory surrounding the topic of U.S. agricultural productivity growth from 1948 to 2013. The central coordinates of our map will be \"U.S. Agricultural Productivity\" with a focus on the period from 1948 to 2013. Establishing the cardinal directions, we have the practical aspects (like technology and labor) and the theoretical aspects (such as economic models and policy frameworks).\n\nAs I explore the boundaries of this territory, I identify neighboring domains such as economic growth theories, technological innovation, labor market dynamics, and government agricultural policies. Noting areas where these territories overlap, I see the interconnectedness of agricultural subsidies, trade agreements, and environmental factors like climate change.\n\nPlotting landmarks, I have key concepts like the Green Revolution, the Farm Bill, and the role of Land-Grant Universities in advancing agricultural knowledge and practices. Mapping \"routes\" or methodologies, I consider the impact of precision agriculture, mechanization, and irrigation on productivity.\n\nFilling in the detail features, I label specialized areas with terms like crop yield data, rural employment trends, and agricultural subsidies. Historical sites include the significant events and policies that have shaped U.S. agricultural productivity over the years, while emerging developments might include the integration of AI and biotechnology in farming.\n\nCreating a cartographic legend, I select terms that would help navigate this knowledge landscape, such as productivity, output, yield, efficiency, input, labor force, policy, innovation, sustainability, market, and demand. These terms will guide the expansion of the query.\n\nApplying the Conceptual Territory Mapping technique systematically, I start by identifying the core concepts related to U.S. agricultural productivity growth. However, I also allow for natural thought patterns to emerge, such as reconsidering the initial query to ensure I've captured its essence accurately. A tangential thought leads me to wonder about the global comparability of agricultural productivity measures, but I refocus on the U.S. context as specified.\n\nIntuitively, I connect the dots between technological innovations, like precision agriculture, and their potential impact on labor markets and environmental sustainability. This reminds me of the related concept of intensive vs. extensive growth in economic theory, which might offer insights into the nature of productivity growth in the agricultural sector.\n\nStepping back to reassess, I realize that the expanded query should indeed encompass the role of technology, labor markets, and government policy in U.S. agricultural productivity growth from 1948 to 2013. The final expanded query, \"U.S. agricultural productivity growth trends 1948-2013, including the role of technology, labor markets, and government policy,\" reflects a synthesis of both the structured approach and natural cognitive patterns.\n\nThrough this process of applying Conceptual Territory Mapping and exploring related threads, I believe the selected terms for a BM25 index effectively capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking. These terms balance the technical, social, and economic dimensions of U.S. agricultural productivity, providing a comprehensive framework for further investigation.",
