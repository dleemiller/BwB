  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n... Historical efforts to reduce coal pollution focused on flue-gas desulfurization starting in the 1850s and clean burn technologies . More recent developments include carbon capture and storage , which pumps and stores CO2 emissions underground , and integrated gasification combined cycle ( IGCC ) involve coal gasification , which provides a basis for increased efficiency and lower cost in capturing CO2 emissions .   There are seven technologies deployed or proposed for deployment in the United States :  carbon capture and storage ( CCS ) ,  flue-gas desulfurization ,  fluidized-bed combustion ,  integrated gasification combined cycle ( IGCC ) ,  low nitrogen oxide burners ,  selective catalytic reduction ( SCR ) , and  electrostatic precipitators .  Of the 22 demonstration projects funded by the U.S. Department of Energy since 2003 , none are in operation as of February 2017 , having been abandoned or delayed due to capital budget overruns or discontinued because of excessive operating expenses .\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n... The first commercial example was the Weyburn-Midale Carbon Dioxide Project in 2000 . Other examples include SaskPower 's Boundary Dam and Mississippi Power 's Kemper Project . ` CCS ' can also be used to describe the scrubbing of from ambient air as a climate engineering technique .   An integrated pilot-scale CCS power plant was to begin operating in September 2008 in the eastern German power plant Schwarze Pumpe run by utility Vattenfall , to test the technological feasibility and economic efficiency . CCS applied to a modern conventional power plant could reduce emissions to the atmosphere by approximately 80 -- 90 % compared to a plant without CCS . The IPCC estimates that the economic potential of CCS could be between 10 % and 55 % of the total carbon mitigation effort until year 2100 .   Carbon dioxide can be captured out of air or fossil fuel power plant flue gas using adsorption ( or carbon scrubbing ) , membrane gas separation , or adsorption technologies . ...\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: The Carmichael coal mine is a proposed thermal coal mine in the north of the Galilee Basin in Central Queensland , Australia . Mining is planned to be conducted by both open-cut and underground methods . The mine is proposed by Adani Mining , a wholly owned subsidiary of India 's Adani Group . The development represents a $ 16.5 billion investment .   At peak capacity the mine would produce 60 million tonnes of coal a year . In court , Adani said it expects the mine to produce 2.3 billion tonnes over 60 years . It would be the largest coal mine in Australia and one of the largest in the world . The mine would be the first of a number of large mines proposed for the Galilee Basin and would facilitate their development .   Exports are to leave the country via port facilities at Hay Point and Abbot Point after being transported to the coast via rail . The proposal includes a new 189 km rail line to connect with the existing Goonyella railway line . ...\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, 'clean coal' makes me think of an approach to reduce emissions from coal-burning power plants. The user might actually be trying to find information on the effectiveness and feasibility of this technology, as well as its environmental impact. \n\n Analyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the strengths lie in accurate definitions and descriptions of the 'clean coal' technology and its carbon capture and storage method. However, the weaknesses are apparent in the lack of diverse perspectives on practicality, effectiveness, viability, and cost. This suggests that the user needs a more comprehensive overview of the topic.\n\nTo expand the query, I will apply the Conceptual Graph Traversal technique. This involves constructing a conceptual graph with core nodes, first-order connections, and second-order connections to identify high-value expansion terms. \n\nFirst, I identify the core concepts and entities in the original query: 'clean coal', 'carbon capture', and 'storage'. The search intent is informational, and there are implicit assumptions about the effectiveness and feasibility of the technology.\n\nNext, I build a conceptual graph with these components: \n- Core nodes: 'clean coal', 'carbon capture', 'storage', and 'power plants'\n- First-order connections: 'emissions', 'environmental impact', 'economic viability', and 'project status'\n- Second-order connections: 'renewable energy alternatives', 'climate policy implications', and 'lifecycle assessment'\n\nNow, I select promising directions for query expansion: \n- Synonymous terms: 'carbon sequestration', 'underground injection'\n- Hierarchical terms: 'energy technology', 'environmental issue', 'climate change mitigation'\n- Compositional terms: 'power generation', 'geological storage'\n- Contextual terms: 'policy and regulation', 'economic feasibility'\n\nFor each expansion path, I extract high-value terms and filter them based on relevance, distinctiveness, specificity, and searchability. The extracted terms include 'carbon capture and storage', 'CCS', 'economic viability', 'cost effectiveness', 'environmental impact', 'project status', 'feasibility studies', 'climate policy implications', 'lifecycle assessment', 'environmental risk assessment', and 'renewable energy alternatives'.\n\nAs I apply the Conceptual Graph Traversal technique, I notice that the terms 'criticism', 'challenges', 'drawbacks', 'limitations', and 'controversies' are also relevant to the user's search intent. These terms can provide a more comprehensive overview of the 'clean coal' technology and its implications.\n\noccasionally, I reconsider my approach and think about the potential false starts or reconsiderations. For example, I think about the potential benefits of including terms related to 'energy efficiency' or 'sustainable development'. However, upon further reflection, I realize that these terms are not directly relevant to the user's search intent.\n\nThrough this process of applying the Conceptual Graph Traversal technique and exploring related threads, I believe the terms 'clean coal', 'carbon capture and storage', 'CCS', 'carbon sequestration', 'underground injection', 'economic viability', 'cost effectiveness', 'environmental impact', 'project status', 'feasibility studies', 'climate policy implications', 'lifecycle assessment', 'environmental risk assessment', 'renewable energy alternatives', 'criticism', 'challenges', 'drawbacks', 'limitations', and 'controversies' would be most effective for retrieving relevant documents. These terms capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking.\n\nUpon reflection, I realize that my thought process has been a combination of systematic application of the Conceptual Graph Traversal technique and natural cognitive elements, such as reconsiderations, intuitive connections, and brief tangents. This balanced approach has allowed me to identify high-value expansion terms that will improve document retrieval and provide the user with a more comprehensive overview of the 'clean coal' technology.",
