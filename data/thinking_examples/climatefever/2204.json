  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n... There was increased public interest in 2013 in the run-up to publication of the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report , and despite concerns that a 15-year period was too short to determine a meaningful trend , the IPCC included a section on a hiatus , which it defined as a much smaller increasing linear trend over the 15 years from 1998 to 2012 , than over the 60 years from 1951 to 2012 . Various studies examined possible causes of the short-term slowdown . Even though the overall climate system has continued to accumulate energy due to Earth 's positive energy budget , the available temperature readings at the Earth 's surface indicate slower rates of increase in surface warming than in the prior decade . Since measurements at the top of the atmosphere show that Earth is receiving more energy than it is radiating back into space , the retained energy should be producing warming in the Earth 's climate system .   Research reported in July 2015 on an updated NOAA dataset casts doubt on the existence of a hiatus , and it finds no indication of a slowdown even in earlier years . ...\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: Oceanic anoxic events or anoxic events ( anoxia conditions ) refer to intervals in the Earth 's past where portions of oceans become depleted in oxygen ( O2 ) at depths over a large geographic area . During some of these events , euxinia , waters that contained hydrogen sulfide , developed . Although anoxic events have not happened for millions of years , the geological record shows that they happened many times in the past . Anoxic events coincided with several mass extinctions and may have contributed to them . These mass extinctions include some that geobiologists use as time markers in biostratigraphic dating . Many geologists believe oceanic anoxic events are strongly linked to slowing of ocean circulation , climatic warming , and elevated levels of greenhouse gases . Researchers have proposed enhanced volcanism ( the release of CO2 ) as the `` central external trigger for euxinia '' .\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: The Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 \u00b0C (SR15) was published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) on 8 October 2018. The report, approved in Incheon, South Korea, includes over 6,000 scientific references, and was prepared by 91 authors from 40 countries. In December 2015, the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference called for the report. The report was delivered at the United Nations' 48th session of the IPCC to \"deliver the authoritative, scientific guide for governments\" to deal with climate change.Its key finding is that meeting a 1.5 \u00b0C (2.7 \u00b0F) target is possible but would require \"deep emissions reductions\" and \"rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society.\" Furthermore, the report finds that \"limiting global warming to 1.5 \u00b0C compared with 2 \u00b0C would reduce challenging impacts on ecosystems, human health and well-being\" and that a 2 \u00b0C temperature increase would exacerbate extreme weather, rising sea levels and diminishing Arctic sea ice, coral bleaching, and loss of ecosystems, among other impacts. SR15 also has modelling that shows that, for global warming to be limited to 1.5 \u00b0C, \"Global net human-caused emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) would need to fall by about 45 percent from 2010 levels by 2030, reaching 'net zero' around 2050.\" The reduction of emissions by 2030 and its associated changes and challenges, including rapid decarbonisation, was a key focus on much of the reporting which was repeated through the world.\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"All the indicators show that global warming is still happening,\" my initial impression is that the user is seeking confirmation of the ongoing reality of global warming, likely looking for evidence and information that support the scientific consensus. However, the query lacks specific sources, which suggests a need for more targeted and verifiable information. This makes me think about how to expand the query to capture a broader range of relevant results without losing focus on the core topic.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the existing reasoning focuses on confirming global warming, finding scientific evidence, locating reputable sources, and exploring current trends. The ineffective terms identified, such as \"indicators\" and \"all,\" are too broad and do not add much value to the search. This analysis points to the need for a more specific and diverse expansion strategy.\n\nTo approach this, I will use a structured technique that involves several steps. The technique, which we can call \"query augmentation,\" starts with goal elucidation and gap identification. Here, the primary objective is to confirm global warming and find evidence, but there's a gap in specific, targeted information. Following this, I identify ineffective terms that should be avoided, which, as mentioned, include \"indicators\" and \"all.\"\n\nThe next step involves breadth expansion, where I list candidate terms with increasingly distant concepts to the original query. From the provided information, terms like \"climate change impacts,\" \"greenhouse gas emissions,\" \"temperature anomalies,\" \"sea level rise,\" and \"extreme weather events\" are relevant. These terms introduce new dimensions to the query, focusing on the effects and factors related to global warming.\n\nThen, I move on to depth expansion, choosing one distant but important topic and going deeper into related terms. For instance, selecting \"climate models\" allows me to delve into concepts like \"feedback loops,\" \"carbon sequestration,\" \"mitigation strategies,\" and \"adaptation measures.\" This step provides a deeper understanding of the mechanisms and potential solutions related to global warming.\n\nAs I apply this technique, I notice how it systematically guides me to uncover more specific and relevant terms. However, I also find myself making intuitive connections and considering tangents that might not be immediately obvious. For example, the mention of \"sea level rise\" reminds me of the importance of \"oceanic anoxic events\" and their potential link to climate change, as indicated in one of the text snippets. This connection, while not directly derived from the technique, complements the structured approach by introducing a new perspective on the consequences of global warming.\n\nThrough this process, insights emerge from both the structured technique and my natural thought patterns. Applying the technique leads to the discovery of specific terms like \"mitigation strategies\" and \"adaptation measures,\" which are directly relevant to addressing global warming. Meanwhile, my intuition and experience suggest that incorporating terms related to \"climate models\" and \"greenhouse gas emissions\" could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the issue.\n\nSynthesizing these findings, I believe the terms that would be most effective for a BM25 index include those from the depth expansion, such as \"climate models,\" \"greenhouse gas emissions,\" \"temperature anomalies,\" \"sea level rise,\" \"extreme weather events,\" \"mitigation strategies,\" and \"adaptation measures.\" These terms capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, offering a balanced and informative search query that is likely to yield relevant and useful results.\n\nIn conclusion, the thought process behind expanding the query involves a combination of initial impressions, analysis of the original query's strengths and weaknesses, application of a structured technique, and the integration of natural thought patterns and intuitive connections. This approach ensures that the final expanded query is not only logically derived but also enriched by the nuances of human thought and experience.",
