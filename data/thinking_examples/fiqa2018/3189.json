  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: Didn't see it mentioned so far, but depending on modified AGI you may be prevented from a tax deduction for your contribution to a Traditional IRA if you or your spouse are offered a retirement plan at work, even if you don't participate in it.  See the IRS page here for the details of deduction limitability: https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/2017-ira-deduction-limits-effect-of-modified-agi-on-deduction-if-you-are-covered-by-a-retirement-plan-at-work In my opinion, because I heavily favor all the benefits of the Roth, I'd contribute first to a Roth IRA and then to the Roth 401(k).   The former first because it puts the money in a place where you have more control over fees and how it is invested.   The latter because the contribution limits are much higher than the IRA, and the money grows tax-free and incurs no taxes on withdrawal.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: Fund your retirement accounts first.  Even as an intern, it is still worthwhile to open a Roth IRA and start contributing to it. See my answer to a similar question: Best way to start investing, for a young person just starting their career?\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: If you have just started an IRA (presumably with a contribution for 2012),  you likely have $5000 in it, or $10,000 if you made a full contribution for  2013 as well. At this time, I would recommend putting it all in a  single low-cost mutual fund. Typically, mutual funds that track an index such as the S&P 500 Index have lower costs (annual expense fees) than actively managed funds, and most investment companies offer such mutual funds, with Fidelity, Vanguard, Schwab, to name a few, having very low expenses even among index funds. Later, when you have more money in the account, you can consider diversifying into more funds, buying stocks and bonds, investing in ETFs, etc. ...\n",
  "thought_process": "As I begin to expand the query \"Diversify my retirement investments with a Roth IRA,\" my initial impression is that the user is likely someone who already has a basic understanding of retirement investments but is looking to optimize their portfolio. This makes me think of various strategies for diversification, though the user might actually be trying to understand how to make the most out of their Roth IRA investments, given the complexities of the financial market. Hmm, not sure yet what specific aspects of diversification they're interested in\u2014whether it's about minimizing risk, maximizing returns, or navigating the tax implications of a Roth IRA.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that there are strengths in the search terms, such as the clear mention of \"Roth IRA\" and \"diversify,\" which immediately points towards retirement planning and investment strategies. However, there's a weakness in that the query doesn't specify what kind of diversification the user is looking for, suggesting a need to broaden the search terms to capture the full scope of possible user intents.\n\nLet's approach this using the \"Query Expansion via User Intent and Journey Mapping\" technique, which involves understanding the user's journey from being a novice to an expert in the topic of retirement investments and Roth IRAs. This should help because it allows us to consider various stages of learning and decision-making that the user might be going through, thereby enriching our search terms to cater to a wider range of information needs.\n\nStarting with organic thinking, I consider how a novice investor might begin by looking up basic information on what a Roth IRA is and how it works, while an intermediate investor would seek specific advice on diversifying investments within a Roth IRA. An advanced investor, on the other hand, would be looking for sophisticated diversification techniques and asset allocation guidance. This progression suggests that we need terms related to basic Roth IRA information, investment strategies, risk management, and possibly even tax planning.\n\nAs I systematically apply the steps of the \"Query Expansion via User Intent and Journey Mapping\" technique, I first identify key personas: the novice, intermediate, advanced, and expert investors. Each persona has different goals, motivations, and prior knowledge levels, affecting their search vocabulary and behavior. For instance, a novice might search for \"Roth IRA definition\" or \"how Roth IRA works,\" while an expert might look for \"Roth IRA portfolio optimization\" or \"advanced asset allocation models.\"\n\nNext, I analyze the search vocabulary for each persona, noting how their terms evolve as they gain more knowledge. The novice starts with basic questions, the intermediate seeks practical advice, the advanced looks for strategies, and the expert delves into complex financial planning. This analysis reveals a spectrum of search terms that can be used to expand the original query, ensuring it captures the diverse needs of users at various stages of their investment journey.\n\nI also consider the journey stages\u2014awareness, exploration, decision-making, and implementation & optimization\u2014where users might need information on Roth IRAs and diversification strategies. At each stage, different questions and concerns arise, further broadening the range of relevant search terms.\n\nOccasionally, I find myself on a false start or reconsidering a term, but these moments often lead to intuitive connections that complement the technique. For example, thinking about tax implications reminds me of the importance of \"tax-efficient diversification techniques\" for Roth IRAs, which might not have been immediately apparent but is crucial for advanced investors.\n\nThroughout this process, insights emerge from both the structured approach and my natural thought patterns. Applying the technique systematically leads to discoveries like the need for \"low-risk investment options\" and \"specific asset allocation recommendations,\" which cater to the intermediate and advanced investors. Meanwhile, my instinct suggests considering \"non-traditional investments in Roth IRA\" for the expert investor, highlighting the importance of staying open to unconventional yet potentially valuable strategies.\n\nStepping back to reassess, I realize that the expanded query needs to balance specificity with breadth, covering both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking. The terms \"diversification strategies for Roth IRA investments,\" \"specific asset allocation recommendations,\" \"low-risk investment options for a Roth IRA,\" and \"tax-efficient diversification techniques\" emerge as key components of the augmented query. These terms not only reflect the structured analysis but also incorporate the natural cognitive elements of reconsideration, intuitive leaps, and connections made throughout the thought process.\n\nIn synthesizing this information with clarity, I believe that applying the \"Query Expansion via User Intent and Journey Mapping\" technique, while allowing for the interplay of structured steps and natural thought patterns, has led to an effective expansion of the original query. The resulting terms capture the essence of what users at different stages of their journey might be looking for when seeking to diversify their retirement investments with a Roth IRA.",
