  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: Defined Benefit - the benefit you receive when you retire is defined e.g. $500 a month if you retire at age 65. It is up to the plan administrators to manage the pension fund, and ensure that there is enough money to cover the benefits based on the life expectancy of the retiree. Defined Contribution - the amount you contribute to the plan is defined. The benefit you receive at retirement depends on how well the investments do over the years.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n... Your employer may use a schedule in which employees are 100 percent vested in employer contributions after 3 years of service (cliff   vesting). Under graduated vesting, an employee must be at least 20   percent vested after 2 years, 40 percent after 3 years, 60 percent   after 4 years, 80 percent after 5 years, and 100 percent after 6   years. If your automatic enrollment 401(k) plan requires employer   contributions, you vest in those contributions after 2 years.   Automatic enrollment 401(k) plans with optional matching contributions   follow one of the vesting schedules noted above.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: Didn't see it mentioned so far, but depending on modified AGI you may be prevented from a tax deduction for your contribution to a Traditional IRA if you or your spouse are offered a retirement plan at work, even if you don't participate in it.  See the IRS page here for the details of deduction limitability: https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/2017-ira-deduction-limits-effect-of-modified-agi-on-deduction-if-you-are-covered-by-a-retirement-plan-at-work In my opinion, because I heavily favor all the benefits of the Roth, I'd contribute first to a Roth IRA and then to the Roth 401(k).   The former first because it puts the money in a place where you have more control over fees and how it is invested.   The latter because the contribution limits are much higher than the IRA, and the money grows tax-free and incurs no taxes on withdrawal.\n",
  "thought_process": "As I delve into the query \"How does a defined contribution plan work?\", my initial impressions are that this is a fundamental question in the realm of financial planning, particularly relevant to individuals seeking to understand their retirement options. The query itself is straightforward, but I suspect the user might be looking for more than just a basic explanation; they might be seeking a comparison with other retirement plans, such as traditional pension plans, or perhaps they're interested in the specifics of how defined contribution plans operate, like employer matching and vesting schedules.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the top documents provide comprehensive explanations of defined contribution plans, including how they differ from defined benefit plans, the role of employer matching, and the concept of vesting. However, these explanations seem somewhat technical and might not fully address the user's underlying concerns or provide the comparative analysis they're looking for.\n\nTo expand this query effectively, I'll transition to using the \"Query Expansion via Community Q&A Patterns\" technique. This approach involves reframing the query to reflect how people naturally explore topics in community Q&A platforms, identifying hidden motivations behind their inquiries, and highlighting valuable types of responses based on community interactions.\n\nStarting with question reframing, I consider how the original query could be rephrased to solicit personal experiences, advice, opinions, comparisons, or stories related to defined contribution plans. For instance, \"What has your experience been like managing a defined contribution plan?\" or \"How should I decide between different types of retirement plans for myself?\" These reframed questions can help uncover the user's true interests and concerns, potentially revealing a desire for validation, decision support, insider knowledge, diverse perspectives, or emotional support.\n\nThe next step involves identifying valuable response patterns, such as first-person narratives, expert opinions, practical advice, contrarian views, and nuanced conditional answers. By targeting these response types, the expanded query can be designed to elicit a wide range of insights that cater to different aspects of the user's inquiry.\n\nAs I apply the technique's steps systematically, I also allow for natural thought patterns to emerge. For example, considering the follow-up questions people might ask, such as clarifications on vesting schedules or debates over the merits of defined contribution versus defined benefit plans, can lead to a more comprehensive understanding of the topic. It's also important to notice patterns in community interactions, like how questions evolve through comments and discussions, which can reveal deeper concerns or related inquiries that the user might have.\n\nThe process of applying the \"Query Expansion via Community Q&A Patterns\" technique leads to several key insights. Firstly, the importance of understanding the vocabulary and terminology that real people use when discussing defined contribution plans becomes apparent. Terms like \"vesting schedule,\" \"employer match,\" and \"retirement savings\" are crucial, but so are more subjective expressions of risk tolerance, financial jargon, and personal anecdotes. Secondly, the technique highlights the value of diverse perspectives and experiences, underscoring the need for a query expansion strategy that incorporates these elements.\n\nThrough this process, I realize that the expanded query should not only provide a clear explanation of defined contribution plans but also address the comparative aspects with traditional pension plans, delve into the specifics of employer matching and vesting schedules, and perhaps even touch upon the emotional and decision-support aspects of choosing a retirement plan. The final expanded query, \"How does a defined contribution plan work, particularly in terms of employer matching, vesting schedules, and comparing it with traditional pension plans for retirement security?\", reflects this comprehensive approach.\n\nIn synthesizing the insights from both the structured technique and natural thought patterns, it becomes clear that the key to effective query expansion lies in balancing systematic analysis with intuitive connections and community-driven insights. By doing so, the expanded query can capture the essence of the user's inquiry, providing a foundation for retrieval results that are not only informative but also relevant and engaging.",
