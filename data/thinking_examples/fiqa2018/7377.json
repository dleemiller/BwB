  "reasoning": "The query pertains to the specific type of returns Vanguard quotes, which could involve understanding their methodology in financial reporting. Given the current results focus on qualitative insights and broad performance metrics without directly addressing return types like arithmetic or geometric means, we need to augment the query with relevant historical, developmental, and terminological context related to these concepts. By exploring how the concept of 'returns' has evolved and is discussed in financial literature over time, we can enhance the precision and relevance of the search.",

So that's part of the puzzle im getting at.  I'm not necessarily trying to understand my net fees, but more who pays who and based off of what.   For a quick example, betterment bought me a bunch of vanguard ETFs. That's cool. But vanguard underperformed vs their blackrock and ssga etfs. I get that vanguard has lower fees, but the return was less even taking those into account.  I'm wondering, first what sort of kickback betterment got for buying those funds, inclusive of wholesale deals, education fees etc.  I'm also wondering how this food chain goes up and down the sponsor, manager tree.  I'm sure it's more than just splitting up that 1%\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: \"In this instance \"\"quotational\"\" is a reference to a market price quote, not a mathematical function.

  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"What type of returns Vanguard is quoting?\", this makes me think of financial reporting and performance metrics. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the methodology behind Vanguard's return calculations, I'm not sure yet what specific aspects they're interested in. The query seems straightforward, but the context could significantly impact the type of answer they're seeking.\n\nAnalyzing the initial results, I notice that they don't directly address the types of returns Vanguard quotes. Instead, they provide qualitative insights into Vanguard's performance, customer complaints, and general information about investing and fund management. This tells me that my search terms might not be specific enough or that the context in which Vanguard discusses returns needs further clarification.\n\nTo expand this query effectively, I'll use the Temporal Evolution Analysis technique. This involves tracing how the concept of returns in financial reporting has evolved over time, identifying key milestones, current practices, and emerging trends. By understanding this evolution, I can uncover a broader range of relevant terms and concepts that might be used by Vanguard or in discussions about their financial reporting.\n\nStarting with the historical foundation, the concept of returns in finance has its roots in early financial literature, where methods like arithmetic and geometric means were introduced for calculating investment returns. Mathematicians like Leonard Euler recognized the geometric mean as significant for compounded growth rates, laying the groundwork for modern portfolio theory. This theory emphasizes the importance of different return measures, which has influenced how financial institutions, including Vanguard, report their performance.\n\nMoving on to developmental milestones, the adoption of the geometric mean in evaluating long-term fund performance became more prevalent in the mid-20th century. The development and increased use of the Sharpe Ratio, which depends on understanding different types of returns, further underscored the importance of nuanced return calculations. The introduction of Total Return Indexes, which calculate returns using reinvestment at period-end rates, added another layer of complexity and accuracy to financial reporting.\n\nIn the current landscape, there's a common industry preference for using geometric means to evaluate mutual funds and ETFs, as it represents realistic compounded growth. There's also a push for standardization in financial reporting practices, with an emphasis on transparency in how returns are quoted by firms like Vanguard. Regulatory bodies are encouraging clear differentiation between types of return measures used, which suggests that investors and analysts are seeking more detailed and accurate information about financial performance.\n\nLooking at emerging trends, there's a growing interest in incorporating Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors into return calculations for sustainable investment performance metrics. Personalized investment platforms are using AI to offer bespoke portfolio performance insights based on client-specific goals, and machine learning algorithms are being incorporated to predict future fund returns with a more nuanced understanding of historical data.\n\nThrough this analysis, terms like arithmetic mean, geometric mean, compounded annual growth rate (CAGR), Sharpe Ratio, Total Return Index, ESG metrics, and machine learning analytics emerge as relevant. These terms capture the temporal evolution of return calculations in finance and reflect both historical context and modern regulatory standards.\n\nApplying the Temporal Evolution Analysis technique systematically, I first identify the foundational concepts and then trace their development over time, noting key milestones and current practices. I also consider emerging trends that might impact how returns are calculated and reported in the future. This structured approach helps uncover a range of terms and concepts that are relevant to understanding the types of returns Vanguard quotes.\n\nHowever, it's also important to balance this structured technique with natural thought patterns. For instance, considering the potential for personalized investment platforms to influence how returns are perceived and reported adds a layer of complexity that might not be immediately apparent through a purely historical or technical analysis. Similarly, recognizing the role of ESG factors in modern investment decisions highlights the evolving nature of financial reporting and performance metrics.\n\nAs I reflect on the insights gained from both the structured analysis and natural thought processes, it becomes clear that the expanded query should incorporate terms that reflect the historical, developmental, and emerging aspects of return calculations in finance. This includes considering how Vanguard's methodology might align with or differ from industry standards and trends.\n\nThrough this process of applying the Temporal Evolution Analysis technique and exploring related threads, I believe the terms that would be most effective for a BM25 index are those that capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking. These include specific types of returns (arithmetic vs. geometric), historical methods, modern regulatory standards, and emerging trends in financial reporting and performance metrics.\n\nIn synthesizing this information, the final expanded query, \"What specific type of returns (arithmetic vs. geometric) does Vanguard quote in their financial reporting and performance metrics, considering historical methods and modern regulatory standards?\", emerges as a logical and comprehensive expression of the user's original question, enhanced by the insights gained from the Temporal Evolution Analysis technique and balanced with natural cognitive patterns.",
