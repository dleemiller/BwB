  "reasoning": "The query aims to find the average cost of a portfolio on a trading site. The existing results discuss cost factors in trading and investing but don't directly answer the question. To address this, I will create a conceptual map focusing on the components that contribute to the cost of a portfolio, the different types of fees involved, and related concepts like portfolio size and trading frequency. This will allow me to identify key navigation terms and expand the query to retrieve more relevant information.",

  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: That doesn't sound like dollar cost averaging. That sounds like a form of day trading. Dollar cost averaging is how most people add money to their 401K, or how they add money to some IRA accounts. You are proposing a form of day trading.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: See the Moneychimp site. From 1934 to 2006, the S&P returned an 'average' 12.81%. But the CAGR was 11.26%.  I wrote an article Average Return vs Compound Annual Growth to address this issue.  Interesting that over time only a few funds have managed to get anywhere near this return, but the low cost indexer can get the long term CAGR minus .05% or so, if they wish.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: What is the average daily volume traded? It looks like this stock may have a liquidity problem. If that is the case I would not buy this stock at all as you may have the same problem when you try to sell it. Generally try to stay away from illiquid stocks, if your order size is more than 10% of the average daily volume traded, then don't buy it.  I usually stay away from stocks with an average daily volume of less than 100,000.\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"What is the average cost of a portfolio on a trading site?\" this makes me think of various components that contribute to the overall cost, such as trading fees, management fees, and other expenses. However, the user might actually be trying to understand the total expense of maintaining a portfolio, including indirect costs and how these costs vary across different trading platforms. Hmm, not sure yet how to capture all these aspects in a query.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the discussion revolves around cost factors in trading and investing but doesn't directly address the average cost of a portfolio. The strengths of the search terms lie in their ability to fetch information on trading strategies and investment principles, but the weakness is the lack of specificity towards portfolio costs on trading sites. I see mentions of dollar cost averaging, day trading, and the importance of low-cost indexers, which indicates that users are interested in cost-effective strategies but doesn't give me a clear picture of average portfolio costs.\n\nGiven these observations, I'm seeing several possibilities here... Let me approach this using the Query Expansion via Conceptual Territory Mapping technique, which involves creating a detailed map of the conceptual territory surrounding the topic. This should help because it allows me to systematically explore the query's central coordinates, boundary areas, key landmarks, and detailed features, ultimately leading to the identification of valuable navigation terms.\n\nFollowing the Conceptual Territory Mapping approach, I first identify the central coordinates of the query, which are the average cost and portfolio on a trading site. Establishing the cardinal directions, I consider both practical and theoretical aspects, such as the types of fees, portfolio size, and trading frequency. I then explore the boundary areas, noting neighboring domains like trading psychology, tax implications, financial planning, risk management, and investment strategies, which might influence or be related to portfolio costs.\n\nAs I plot the major landmarks, I identify key concepts like commission fees, management fees, transaction costs, expense ratios, and platform fees. Mapping these out helps me visualize how they interconnect and impact the overall cost of a portfolio. This step of the technique is revealing how complex the cost structure can be, which actually reminds me of the importance of considering the trader's or investor's goals and risk tolerance in determining the appropriate portfolio cost breakdown.\n\nNow, delving into the detail mapping phase, I fill in specialized features within each region, labeling them with precise terminology like AUM-based fees, performance-based fees, and inactivity fees. Noting historical sites and emerging developments, such as the shift towards commission-free trading platforms and the increasing importance of fund expense ratios for ETFs and mutual funds, helps me understand the evolving landscape of portfolio costs.\n\nCreating a cartographic legend, I classify the most important terms by region and significance, selecting terms that would help navigate this knowledge landscape. Terms like \"commission,\" \"management fee,\" \"expense ratio,\" \"AUM,\" \"trading platform,\" \"minimum investment,\" \"bid-ask spread,\" \"transaction cost,\" \"advisory fee,\" and \"platform fee\" emerge as crucial for understanding and calculating the average cost of a portfolio on a trading site.\n\nApplying this specific aspect of the technique leads me to discover terms like \"portfolio cost breakdown\" and \"trading platform fees,\" which I believe are essential for a BM25 index. They capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking regarding portfolio costs. I just had a realization that connects to what we were exploring earlier; the detailed mapping and landmark identification steps complemented my intuition about the query, pointing towards the need for a comprehensive approach to understanding portfolio costs.\n\nThrough this process of applying Conceptual Territory Mapping and exploring related threads, I believe the terms extracted would be most effective for query expansion. They not only reflect the structured approach of the technique but also incorporate natural insights and considerations that emerged during the mapping process. The final augmented query, \"portfolio cost breakdown trading platform fees,\" seems to encapsulate the essence of what the user is looking for, providing a clear direction for further investigation into the average cost of a portfolio on a trading site.",
