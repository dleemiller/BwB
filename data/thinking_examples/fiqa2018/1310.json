  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: This doesn't make any sense. For the people who ask you this, suggest that they borrow the money to invest with you. They can use their bitcoins as collateral for the loan. That way, they get the same benefit and your company doesn't go out of business if the price of bitcoin drops, even temporarily, because the loan becomes unsecured. If they want to try to use a volatile asset as collateral and have to figure out how to cover when the price drops temporarily, great. But why should they put that risk on your other investors who may not be so crazy? Also, this obviously won't meet the investor's concerns anyway. Say the price of bitcoin goes up but you lose 10% of the money you borrowed. Clearly, your investors can't have an interest that worth as much as they would have if they held bitcoin since you lost 10%.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: \"As a legal contract, a mortgage is a form of secured debt. In the case of a mortgage, the debt is secured using the property asset as collateral. So \"\"no\"\", there is no such thing as a mortgage contract without a property to act as collateral. Is it a good idea?  In the current low interest rate environment, people with good income and credit can obtain a creditline from their bank at a rate comparable to current mortgage rates.  However, if you wish to setup a credit line for an amount comparable to a mortgage, then you will need to secure it with some form of collateral.\"\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: There is no way the stock exchange even remotely compares to the efficiency, global reach, and transparency of a decentralized asset exchange like counter wallet.   I'm not saying that these specific implementations will become the next platforms, but they are proof of concept of what's possible and its way better than the way the current institutions handle it. Block chain technology may not carry bitcoin forward to the end game but it will certainly be used in other sectors.\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"Is it possible to take a mortgage using Bitcoin as collateral?\" this makes me think of the feasibility of using digital assets as security for loans. Though the user might actually be trying to explore alternative financial instruments and their potential applications, I'm also considering the implications of such a endeavor, including the risks associated with the volatility of Bitcoin. The initial search results lack clarity on this specific use case, which suggests that we need to dig deeper into the realms of finance, cryptocurrency, and real estate to find relevant information.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the text snippets from documents at k=1 and k=2 discuss the concept of collateral in the context of mortgages and loans, but they don't directly address the use of Bitcoin as collateral. The snippet from document at k=10 touches on the efficiency and transparency of decentralized asset exchanges, which might be relevant to the broader topic of digital assets and their potential applications in finance.\n\nTo expand this query, I'll use the Conceptual Graph Traversal technique, which involves constructing a conceptual graph and traversing it to find high-value expansion terms. First, I'll identify the core concepts and entities in the original query, including \"mortgage,\" \"Bitcoin,\" and \"collateral.\" The search intent is informational, and there are implicit assumptions about the feasibility and risks associated with using Bitcoin as collateral.\n\nNext, I'll build a conceptual graph with core nodes representing the direct entities and concepts from the query. The first-order connections will include direct properties, attributes, and relationships, such as the concept of collateral in mortgages and the characteristics of Bitcoin as a digital asset. Second-order connections will involve related concepts one step removed, like the broader context of digital assets and blockchain technology.\n\nFor expansion path selection, I'll identify promising directions, including synonymous terms (e.g., \"digital assets\" instead of \"Bitcoin\"), hierarchical terms (e.g., \"cryptocurrency\" as a broader concept), and compositional terms (e.g., \"blockchain lending\" as a related concept). I'll also consider contextual terms (e.g., \"mortgage lending\" as a specific application) and domain-specific terminology (e.g., \"crypto-backed loans\" as a field-specific variant).\n\nAs I traverse the conceptual graph, I'll extract high-value terms and filter them based on relevance, distinctiveness, specificity, and searchability. Some potential expansion terms that emerge from this process include \"digital assets,\" \"blockchain lending,\" \"crypto-backed loans,\" and \"alternative investments.\" These terms maintain the original search intent while providing valuable alternative pathways for retrieval.\n\nThrough this process of applying Conceptual Graph Traversal and exploring related threads, I believe the expanded terms would be most effective for a BM25 index: \"mortgage Bitcoin collateral feasibility digital assets blockchain lending.\" These terms capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, including the feasibility of using Bitcoin as collateral for a mortgage and the broader context of digital assets and blockchain technology.\n\nThe final expanded query seems to balance the structured approach of the Conceptual Graph Traversal technique with natural cognitive patterns, including occasional reconsiderations and intuitive connections. For instance, the consideration of \"crypto-backed loans\" as a related concept emerged from the analysis of the conceptual graph, but it also resonates with my intuition about the potential applications of digital assets in finance.\n\nOverall, this thought process reflects a systematic approach to query expansion, enhanced by natural thought patterns and creative connections. The resulting expanded query aims to improve document retrieval by incorporating semantically relevant terms that capture the essence of the user's information need.",
