  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: One thing to consider besides what rules Oregon has, is what rules your old state have. Of course the lack of income tax in Nevada means that most people are trying to convince their new state they are still a resident of Nevada. You are a full-year Oregon resident if you live in Oregon all year.   You are also a full-year Oregon resident, even if you live outside   Oregon, if all of the following are true: Part-year resident: You are a part-year resident if you moved into or out of Oregon during the tax year. The requirement for financial life means that you should: change all your Nevada banks to Oregon banks; Change all your mail to Oregon; Sell any property or end any leases you have in Nevada. Or course you need to research the rules for in state college tuition, death with dignity  if any apply to you. In border areas you must be careful to establish residency for children to attend public schools. Some families try to cheat to get their children into a better school.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: \"I also don't know the specific details for Finland and/or Belgium, however many countries have tax treaties, which generally prevent double taxation (i.e., paying tax in both countries on the same base income). Being that both Finland and Belgium are EU member states, I'm quite certain there's a provision that covers this, and the same would apply: You pay taxes on what you earn while in Finland to Finland, and to Belgium what you earn while in Belgium. All of this is similar to what you presented, however there's also a section where you'd declare how much taxes were paid in other countries. One other thing to note, which will be the determining factor in the above, is whether EU law requires you to change residence to BE for the time you're there. If not  then you'll be paying taxes in Finland the entire time on the entire amount. This comes from an Irish governmental site: \"\"By working in another member state and by transferring your residence there, you are likely to become \"\"resident for tax purposes\"\" there. The definition of fiscal residence varies from one member state to another. You must comply with the laws of the country where you have established your residence. ...\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: Having 401k or HSA is not income and doesn't trigger filing requirements. Withdrawing from 401k or HSA does. Also, in some States, HSA gains are taxed as investment income, so if you have gains in an HSA and you're a resident of such a State - you'll need to file a State tax return and pay taxes on the gains.\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"Tax consequences of changing state residency\", this makes me think of a complex web of legal, financial, and personal considerations. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the practical implications of such a change, I'm not sure yet what specific aspects they're most concerned about - is it the tax implications, the legal requirements, or perhaps the overall financial planning involved?\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the information is scattered and lacks authoritative guidance. The text snippets from the initial results provide some insights, such as the importance of considering the rules of both the old and new states, the concept of domicile, and the potential impact on income tax filings. However, these snippets also reveal gaps in the information, like the lack of clear guidance on navigating tax treaties, estate law, and relocation services.\n\nTo better understand the query and its related concepts, I'll approach this using the Query Expansion via Conceptual Territory Mapping technique. This involves creating a detailed map of the conceptual territory surrounding the topic, identifying central coordinates, boundary areas, landmarks, and detail features. By doing so, I hope to uncover the most relevant terms and concepts that will help us navigate this complex knowledge landscape.\n\nFollowing the technique's steps, I start by identifying the central coordinates of the query, which seems to revolve around the concept of \"State Residency\". Establishing the cardinal directions, I consider both practical and theoretical aspects, as well as technical and social dimensions. The scale of exploration appears to be quite granular, given the complexity of the topic.\n\nAs I explore the boundaries of the query's immediate territory, I notice neighboring domains such as Immigration Status, Financial Planning, and Estate Law. These areas likely intersect with state residency changes, and understanding their connections will be crucial. I also identify key landmarks like \"Domicile\", \"Residency Requirements\", and \"Nexus\", which will serve as essential reference points in our mapping process.\n\nThe detail mapping phase reveals specialized features within each region, such as exemptions, deductions, filing deadlines, and withholding. Labeling these with precise, domain-specific terminology will help us create a cartographic legend that classifies the most important terms by region and significance.\n\nThroughout this process, I find myself reconsidering and refining my understanding of the query and its related concepts. For instance, I initially thought that tax implications would be the primary concern, but as I explore the territory, I realize that legal requirements, financial planning, and even estate law play a significant role. The technique's structured approach helps me systematically identify and organize these connections, while my natural thought patterns allow me to make intuitive leaps and consider unexpected insights.\n\nApplying the technique's steps and balancing them with my natural thought patterns, I begin to see the query's conceptual territory take shape. The central coordinates, boundary areas, landmarks, and detail features all contribute to a rich and nuanced understanding of the topic. I start to identify key terms and concepts that will help us navigate this knowledge landscape, such as \"domicile\", \"nexus\", and \"tax implications\".\n\nAs I synthesize my findings, I realize that the most effective terms for a BM25 index would be those that capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of the user's query. By considering the central coordinates, boundary areas, landmarks, and detail features, I arrive at a set of terms that balance structure and intuition. These terms include \"tax implications of changing state residency\", \"legal requirements for establishing domicile\", and \"impact of residency on income tax filings\".\n\nThrough this process of applying the Query Expansion via Conceptual Territory Mapping technique and exploring related threads, I believe these terms would be most effective for a BM25 index. They capture the complexity and nuance of the topic, and provide a foundation for further exploration and refinement.",
