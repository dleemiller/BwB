When it comes time to rebalance your portfolio after disastrous equity and/or bond returns, you've got in your cash component some excess weighting since it was unaffected by the disastrous performance. That excess cash is ready to be deployed to purchase equities and/or bonds at the lower current prices.  Rebalancing from cash can add a bonus to your returns and smooth volatility.  If you have no cash component and only equities and bonds, you have no money to deploy when both equities and bonds are depressed.  You didn't keep any powder dry.  And, BTW, I would personally keep a bit more than 3% of my powder dry. Consider a short-term cash deposit or good money-market fund for your \"\"equivalent to cash\"\" position.\"\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: \"When we calculate the realized yield of a bond, we assume the coupons are invested at an interest rate. I assume it is some kind of vehicle that guarantees a return, thinking it is government bond, savings account or something. Investing in a benchmark bond index might be risky though for this \"\"interest rate\"\".\"\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: \"Let's talk interest rates on your junk bonds. Even after all that the US has been through (and is still going through), the United States dollar is widely regarded as one of the safest safe havens for your money. As such it serves as a de facto baseline against which all other investments can be measured, the bar everyone has to pass: if you could earn 4% on a 5-year US Treasury bond, or earn 4% on anything else over the next 5 years, you pick the Treasury bond. In many ways this means that the interest rate on a Treasury bond is the closest single measure we have to the price of money all by itself. If someone is loaning you money, they could be loaning it to the Treasury instead; they are losing out by making this loan to you, and must charge you at least this rate just to break even. But most people/governments/countries aren't as credit-worthy as the US Treasury. A few are (the US treasury isn't magical, after all, just really good at what it does), but generally they are not. There is a possibility when loaning money to these entities that you will not get your money back. ...\n",
  "thought_process": "As I delve into the query \"Why government bonds fluctuate so much, even though interest rates don't change that often?\", I find myself pondering the intricate dance of factors that influence government bond price fluctuations. The user's question hints at a deeper curiosity about the underlying mechanisms driving these fluctuations, beyond the simplistic view of interest rate changes. My initial impression is that this query is not just about understanding bond markets but also about grasping the complex interplay of macroeconomic factors, market psychology, and specific bond market dynamics.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that while they touch on relevant concepts, they lack a structured, in-depth explanation and quantitative evidence. This suggests that the user is seeking a more comprehensive understanding, possibly including how different factors quantitatively impact bond price volatility and the role of macroeconomic indicators and events in influencing bond prices.\n\nTransitioning to a more structured approach, I decide to apply the \"Query Expansion Through Journalistic Investigation\" technique. This involves treating the query as a story to be comprehensively researched, identifying real-world contexts, investigating authoritative sources, creating diverse headlines, and extracting specific terms.\n\nApplying this technique systematically, I start by assessing the query to understand what the user is truly seeking. Beyond the surface-level question about government bond fluctuations, the user likely wants to understand the nuanced factors at play, including inflation expectations, geopolitical risk, quantitative easing, and market sentiment. The query goals, as I see them, include understanding these factors, quantifying their impact, and identifying the influence of macroeconomic indicators and market sentiment.\n\nNext, I consider real-world scenarios where this query is relevant, from professional contexts in finance and economics to personal situations involving investment decisions. This helps me broaden my perspective on the query, recognizing that the answer isn't just about bond markets but also about how these markets interact with the broader economy and individual investor behaviors.\n\nInvestigating resourceful sources, I look into notable experts in economics and finance, established methodologies for analyzing bond markets, essential terminology, and organizations involved in bond trading and economic policy. This step is crucial for grounding my understanding in authoritative knowledge and real-world practices.\n\nCreating headlines for articles that could address the query from multiple angles, I come up with titles like \"Decoding Bond Volatility: Beyond the Fed Funds Rate,\" \"Inflation Fears Grip Bond Markets: Are Higher Yields Inevitable?\", and \"The Maturity Factor: How Duration Impacts Bond Price Sensitivity.\" These headlines not only reflect the diversity of factors influencing bond markets but also suggest the complexity and nuance of the topic.\n\nFrom these headlines, I extract specific terms that represent precise concepts related to the query, such as \"bond volatility,\" \"inflation expectations,\" \"geopolitical risk,\" \"quantitative easing,\" and \"market sentiment.\" These terms are valuable because they are used by experts in the field and can help uncover high-quality content about the topic.\n\nAs I apply the technique, I find moments where my systematic approach is complemented by natural cognitive elements. For instance, considering the impact of quantitative easing on bond yields leads me to think about how changes in monetary policy can have ripple effects throughout the economy, influencing not just bond prices but also inflation expectations and market sentiment. This realization connects to my earlier thoughts on the importance of understanding the broader economic context in which bond markets operate.\n\nThrough this process, insights emerge from both the structured technique and my intuitive connections. Applying the journalistic investigation approach leads me to discover key terms and concepts, while my natural thought patterns help me see how these elements interact and influence one another. For example, recognizing the role of geopolitical risk in bond market volatility reminds me of how unexpected events can suddenly shift market sentiment and, consequently, bond prices.\n\nSynthesizing my findings with clarity, I believe that the expanded query should include terms that capture the explicit and implicit aspects of the user's question. The final terms, such as \"inflation expectations,\" \"geopolitical risk,\" \"quantitative easing,\" \"tapering,\" \"duration,\" \"term premium,\" \"credit ratings,\" \"market sentiment,\" and \"real interest rates,\" emerge logically from both the systematic application of the \"Query Expansion Through Journalistic Investigation\" technique and my natural, intuitive insights into the complex dynamics of bond markets.",
