  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: \"Many companies (particularly tech companies like Atlassian) grant their employees \"\"share options\"\" as part of their compensation. A share option is the right to buy a share in the company at a \"\"strike price\"\" specified when the option is granted. Typically these \"\"vest\"\" after 1-4 years so long as the employee stays with the company. Once they do vest, the employee can exercise them by paying the strike price - typically they'd do that if the shares are now more valuable. The amount they pay to exercise the option goes to the company and will show up in the $2.3 million quoted in the question.\"\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: Options granted by an employer to an employee are generally different that the standardized options that are traded on public stock option exchanges.  They may or may not have somewhat comparable terms, but generally the terms are fairly different. As a holder of an expiring employee option, you can only choose to exercise it by paying the specified price and receiving the shares, or not.  It is common that the exercise system will allow you to exercise all the shares and simultaneously sell enough of the acquired shares to cover the option cost of all the shares, thus leaving you owning some of the stock without having to spend any cash.  You will owe taxes on the gain on exercise, regardless of what you do with the stock. If you want to buy publicly-traded options, you should consider that completely separately from your employer options other than thinking about how much exposure you have to your company situation.  It is very common for employees to be imprudently overexposed to their company's stock (through direct ownership or options).\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: \"In general there are two types of futures contract, a put and call.  Both contract types have both common sides of a transaction, a buyer and a seller.  You can sell a put contract, or sell a call contract also; you're just taking the other side of the agreement.  If you're selling it would commonly be called a \"\"sell to open\"\" meaning you're opening your position by selling a contract which is different from simply selling an option that you currently own to close your position. A put contract gives the buyer the right to sell shares (or some asset/commodity) for a specified price on a specified date; the buyer of the contract gets to put the shares on someone else.   A call contract gives the buyer the right to buy shares (or some asset/commodity) for a specified price on a specified date; the buyer of the contract gets to call on someone for shares. \"\"American\"\" options contracts allow the buyer can exercise their rights under the contract on or before the expiration date; while \"\"European\"\" type contracts can only be exercised on the expiration date. ...\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query \"Exercises of employee share options,\" this makes me think of the various ways employees can benefit from share options, though the user might actually be trying to understand the intricacies of exercising these options, including legal implications and vesting schedules. Hmm, not sure yet, but it seems like we're dealing with a topic that intersects finance, law, and human resources.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that while we get a basic overview of employee share options, the information lacks depth in areas like legal regulations, vesting schedules, and transfer complexities. The term \"exercises\" seems too broad and might not be the most effective term for capturing the essence of the query.\n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here... Let me approach this using the expansion technique, which involves identifying ineffective terms, expanding the query breadth, and then delving deeper into a selected area. This should help because it allows us to systematically explore related concepts and uncover more specific, relevant terms.\n\nFollowing the expansion technique, I first identify \"exercises\" as an ineffective term due to its broadness. Then, for breadth expansion, I consider terms like \"employee stock ownership plans,\" \"equity compensation,\" \"stock grants,\" and \"performance-based incentives.\" These terms introduce new dimensions to the query, moving beyond the general concept of exercising options.\n\nNow, for depth expansion, I choose \"vesting schedules\" as a distant but important topic. Delving deeper into this area, I explore terms like \"accelerated vesting,\" \"cliff provisions,\" \"option grant agreements,\" and \"securities regulations.\" These terms provide a more nuanced understanding of the complexities surrounding employee share options.\n\nAs I apply the technique, I also allow for natural cognitive elements to influence my thought process. For instance, considering \"accelerated vesting\" reminds me of \"performance-based incentives,\" which might also be relevant. This connection complements the structured approach, enriching the query with more contextually relevant terms.\n\nThrough this process, insights begin to emerge from both the structured approach and my intuition. Applying the depth expansion leads me to terms like \"option grant agreements\" and \"securities regulations,\" which directly address the legal and regulatory aspects of employee share options. My instinct also suggests including \"tax implications of options\" to capture the financial consequences of exercising these options.\n\nBy synthesizing these findings, I believe the terms that would be most effective for a BM25 index are: \"employee stock ownership plans,\" \"equity compensation,\" \"vesting schedules,\" \"accelerated vesting,\" \"cliff provisions,\" \"option grant agreements,\" and \"securities regulations.\" These terms capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, providing a comprehensive query that balances structure with natural cognitive patterns.",
