  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: You're missing the cost-of-carry aspect: The cost of carry or carrying charge is the cost of storing a physical commodity, such as grain or metals, over a period of time. The carrying charge includes insurance, storage and interest on the invested funds as well as other incidental costs. In interest rate futures markets, it refers to the differential between the yield on a cash instrument and the cost of the funds necessary to buy the instrument. So in a nutshell, you'd have to store the gold (safely), invest your money now, i.e. you're missing out on interests the money could have earned until the futures delivery date.  Well and on top of that you need to get the gold shipped to London or wherever the agreed delivery place is. Edit: Forgot to mention that of course there are arbitrageurs that make sure the futures and spot market prices don't diverge. So the idea isn't that bad as I might have made it sound but being in the arbitrage business myself I should disclaim that profits are small and arbitraging is highly automated, so before you spot a $1 profit somewhere between any two contracts, you can be quite sure it's been taken by an arbitrageur already.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: This is an excellent question; kudos for asking it. How much a person pays over spot with gold can be negotiated in person at a coin shop or in an individual transaction, though many shops will refuse to negotiate.  You have to be a clever and tough negotiator to make this work and you won't have any success online. However, in researching your question, I dug for some information on one gold ETF OUNZ - which is physically backed by gold that you can redeem.  It appears that you only pay the spot price if you redeem your shares for physical gold: But aren't those fees exorbitant? After all, redeeming for 50 ounces   of Gold Eagles would result in a $3,000 fee on a $65,000 transaction.   That's 4.6 percent! Actually, the fee simply reflects the convenience premium that gold   coins command in the market. Here are the exchange fees compared with   the premiums over spot charged by two major online gold retailers: Investors do pay an annual expense ratio, but the trade-off is that as an investor, you don't have to worry about a thief breaking in and stealing your gold.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: \"Sell 200 at 142.

  "thought_process": "As I delve into the query on spot-futures arbitrage in the gold market, my initial impressions lean towards understanding the fundamental principles of arbitrage and how they apply to the gold market. The user seems to be seeking a comprehensive explanation of how to exploit price discrepancies between spot and futures gold prices for profit. However, the existing resources and reasoning provided suggest that there's a need for more concrete examples, a deeper exploration of strategies, and a nuanced understanding of the challenges and risks involved.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the top snippets highlight crucial aspects such as the cost of carry, the role of arbitrageurs in maintaining price equilibrium, and the negotiation of prices over spot in personal transactions. These insights are invaluable but also indicate that the query requires a more systematic and structured approach to fully capture the complexities of gold arbitrage.\n\nThis is where the \"Query Expansion Through Journalistic Investigation\" technique comes into play. By applying this method, I aim to uncover real-world terms and concepts that will enhance our understanding of the query. The process begins with a thorough assessment of the query, identifying the user's true needs and knowledge gaps.

The process has revealed that successful gold arbitrage requires a deep understanding of the gold market, including factors such as interest rates, liquidity risks, and regulatory considerations. The final terms for the expanded query emerge logically from both the investigative technique and the natural insights gained during the process.\n\nIn conclusion, applying the \"Query Expansion Through Journalistic Investigation\" technique has provided a rich and nuanced understanding of spot-futures arbitrage in the gold market. By balancing structured steps with organic thinking and incorporating diverse real-world contexts and expert insights, we've developed a comprehensive approach to addressing the user's query, ultimately leading to the formulation of an augmented query that captures the essence of profitable gold arbitrage strategies.",
