The article you linked to doesn't provide specific numbers for you to evaluate whether volume is high or low. Many people simply look at the charts and use a gut feel for whether a day's volume is \"\"high\"\" or \"\"low\"\" in their estimation. Typically, if a day's volume is not significantly taller than the usual volume, you wouldn't call it high. The same goes for low volume. If you want a more quantitative approach, a simple approach would be to use the normal distribution statistics: Calculate the mean volume and the standard deviation. Anything outside of 1.5 to 2.0 standard deviations (either high or low) could be significant in your analysis. You'll need to pick your own numbers (1.5 or 2.0 are just numbers I pulled out of thin air.) It's hard to read anything specific into volume, since for every seller, there's a buyer, and each has their reasons for doing so. The article you link to has some good examples of using volume as a basis for strengthening conclusions drawn using other factors.\"\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: Open, high, low, close, volume. The hint is that volume on new years day is 0.  DC's comment is actually a better answer than mine - when given any data set, you should really know the meaning of each cell/number.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: \"I would say people are generally talking about the prime lending rate. I have heard the prime lending rate defined as \"\"The rate that banks charge each other when they borrow money overnight.\"\" But it often defined as the rate at which banks lend their most creditworthy customers. That definition comes with the caveat that it is not always held to strictly. Either definition has the same idea: it's the lowest rate at which anyone could currently borrow money. The rate for many types of lending is based upon the prime rate. A variable rate loan might have an interest rate of (Prime + x). The prime rate is in turn based upon the Federal Funds Rate, which is the rate that the Fed sets manually. When the news breaks that \"\"the Fed is raising interest rates by a quarter of a point\"\"  (or similar) it is the Federal Funds Rate that they control. Lending institutions then \"\"fall in line\"\" and adjust the rates at which they lend money. So to summarize: When people refer to \"\"high\"\" or \"\"low\"\" or \"\"rising\"\" interest rates they are conceptually referring to the prime lending rate. When people talk about the Fed raising/lowering interest rates (In the U.S.) they are referring specifically to the Federal Funds Rate (which ultimately sets other lending rates).\"\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"What is considered high or low when talking about volume?\" this makes me think of various contexts where volume could be relevant, though the user might actually be trying to understand this concept in a specific domain, such as finance or physics. The query itself is quite broad and lacks specificity, which could lead to a wide range of interpretations. Initially, my impression is that defining high and low volume would depend heavily on the context in which volume is being measured.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the existing reasoning provided does touch upon the concept of volume in finance and investing, highlighting the relative nature of volume and the importance of context. However, the results seem to lack concrete examples or standardized thresholds for what constitutes high or low volume. This indicates a need to delve deeper into specific financial instruments or market contexts where volume is a critical factor.\n\nThe task outcomes outlined, including defining high and low volume in finance, identifying context-dependent volume thresholds, and exploring quantitative volume analysis methods, provide a clearer direction for expanding the query. The augmented query, \"What is considered high or low volume for trading stocks in a volatile market?\" already narrows down the scope to a specific context, which is a good starting point.\n\nNow, let's approach this using the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal technique, which involves constructing a conceptual graph and traversing it to find high-value expansion terms. This technique should help because it systematically explores the semantic relationships between concepts, potentially uncovering relevant terms that might not be immediately apparent.\n\nFirst, identifying the core concepts and entities in the original query, we have \"volume,\" \"high,\" \"low,\" and the implicit context of finance or trading. The search intent is informational, seeking to understand the thresholds for volume in a specific market scenario. There are implicit assumptions about the importance of volume in trading decisions and the need for a quantitative approach to define these thresholds.\n\nConstructing the conceptual graph, we start with core nodes like \"volume,\" \"trading,\" \"stocks,\" and \"volatile market.\" First-order connections include properties like \"trading activity,\" \"liquidity,\" and \"market depth.\" Second-order connections might involve related concepts such as \"risk management,\" \"investment strategies,\" and \"market analysis tools.\" The domain context here is finance, specifically stock trading in volatile markets.\n\nFor expansion path selection, we can consider synonymous terms (e.g., \"trading volume\" instead of \"volume\"), hierarchical terms (broader concepts like \"market metrics\" or narrower ones like \"intraday volume\"), compositional terms (parts of the trading process affected by volume), contextual terms (other market conditions that influence volume perception), and domain-specific terminology (financial jargon related to volume analysis).\n\nExtracting and filtering terms, we look for relevance, distinctiveness, specificity, and searchability. Terms like \"relative volume,\" \"average daily volume,\" \"volume indicators,\" and \"market volatility indices\" could be valuable. These terms maintain the original search intent while providing alternative pathways for retrieval, potentially leading to more precise and relevant information on defining high and low volume in the context of trading stocks.\n\nThrough this process of applying the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal technique and exploring related threads, I believe terms such as \"trading volume,\" \"market volatility,\" \"relative volume,\" \"average daily volume,\" and \"volume indicators\" would be most effective for enhancing the query. These terms capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, offering a more focused inquiry into the concept of volume in stock trading.",
