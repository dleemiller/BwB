  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: \"Whenever you do paid work for a company, you will need to fill out some sort of paperwork so that the company knows how to pay you, and also how to report how much they paid you to the appropriate government agencies. You should not think of this as a \"\"hurdle\"\" and you shouldn't worry that you haven't been employed for a long time. The two most common ways a company pays an individual are via employee wages, or \"\"independent contractor\"\" payments. When you start a relationship with a company, if you are going to become an employee, then you will out a W4 form, and at the end of the year you will receive a W2 form. If you are an independent contractor, (which you would be considered in this case), you will fill out form W9 and at the end of the year you will receive a 1099. This is completely normal and you have nothing to worry about. All it means is that if you make more than a certain amount (typically $600) in a year, you will receive a 1099 in the mail or electronically. The 1099 form basically means that they are reporting that amount to the IRS, and it also helps you file your tax return by showing you all the numbers you need on one form. Please remember that when you are paid as an independent contractor, no taxes are withheld on your behalf, so you may owe some tax on the money you make. It's best to set aside some of your income so you are prepared to pay it come tax time next year.\"\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: \"1. What forms do I need to file to receive money from Europe None. Your client can pay you via wire transfer. They need to know your name, address, account number, and the name of your bank, its SWIFT number and its associated address. The addresses and names are required to make sure there are no typos in the numbers. 2. What forms do I need to file to pay people in Latin America (or any country outside the US) None. 1099s only need to be filled out when the contractor has a US tax ID. Make sure they are contractors. If they work for you for more than 2 years, that can create a problem unless they incorporate because they might look like \"\"employees\"\" to the IRS in which case you need to be reporting their identitites to the IRS via a W-8BEN form. Generally speaking any foreign contractor you have for more than 2 years should incorporate in their own country and you bill that corporation to prevent employee status from occurring. 3. Can I deduct payments I made to contractors from other countries as company expense Of course.\"\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: Talk to a tax professional. The IRS really doesn't like the deduction, and it's a concept (like independent contractors) that is often not done properly. You need to, at a minimum, have records, including timestamped photographs, proving that: Remember, documentation is key, and must be filed and accessible for a number of years. Poor record keeping will cost you dearly, and the cost of keeping those records is something that you need to weigh against the benefit.\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"How should I file my taxes as a contractor?\" this makes me think of the complexities involved in tax filing for individuals who are not traditional employees. The user might actually be trying to understand the specific forms they need to fill out, the deductions they can claim, and how to navigate the tax system as a self-employed individual. However, the query is quite broad, and the user's specific situation and level of expertise in tax matters are unknown.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the top results touch upon key concepts such as the difference between being an employee and an independent contractor, the forms required for tax filing (like the 1099 form), and the importance of record-keeping for deductions. However, these results lack structured guidance and do not cater to the diverse needs of users at different stages of their journey, from novice to expert.\n\nTo expand this query effectively, I will use the technique of Query Expansion via User Intent and Journey Mapping. This involves creating user personas with varying levels of expertise, analyzing their search vocabulary, mapping their information journey, identifying contextual scenarios, and extracting intent-based terms.\n\nFirst, I create four distinct user personas: the Novice Contractor who is new to freelancing and needs basic information on tax filing, the Intermediate Contractor who is looking for ways to optimize their tax strategy, the Advanced Contractor who is seeking detailed guidance on complex tax scenarios, and the Tax Expert who requires up-to-date information on tax law changes and advanced accounting techniques.\n\nNext, I analyze the search vocabulary for each persona, considering their initial search terms, follow-up searches, and how their vocabulary differs based on their expertise level. For instance, a novice might search for \"how to file taxes as a freelancer,\" while an advanced contractor might look for \"complex tax scenarios for contractors\" or \"legal strategies for minimizing contractor taxes.\"\n\nI then map the progressive information needs of these users as they learn and grow in their understanding of tax filing as contractors. This involves identifying entry-point questions, intermediate learning milestones, and advanced concept exploration vocabulary. For example, an entry-point question might be \"what forms do I need to file as a contractor?\" while an advanced concept could be \"international tax implications for contractors.\"\n\nConsidering contextual scenarios is also crucial. Users might need information on tax filing in different situations, such as preparing for annual tax filing, understanding quarterly tax payments, or seeking deductions to reduce tax liability. Each scenario requires specific and tailored information that addresses the user's immediate needs and concerns.\n\nFinally, I extract intent-based terms that reflect how users describe their needs at different stages of their journey. These terms include \"file taxes,\" \"contractor tax,\" \"self-employment tax,\" \"1099,\" \"deductible expenses,\" \"tax forms,\" \"estimated taxes,\" \"tax software,\" \"IRS,\" \"state taxes,\" \"freelancer tax,\" \"gig worker tax,\" \"tax planning,\" and \"tax optimization.\"\n\nThrough this process of applying the Query Expansion via User Intent and Journey Mapping technique and exploring related threads, I believe the expanded query should include terms that capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking. The final expanded query, \"How to file taxes as a contractor, including form requirements, deductible expenses for self-employed individuals, and tips for reducing tax liability,\" reflects a comprehensive approach to addressing the user's needs, from basic form requirements to advanced strategies for tax optimization.\n\nThis thought process demonstrates how combining structured techniques with natural cognitive patterns can lead to a more effective query expansion. By considering the diverse needs and journeys of different users, we can create queries that are more inclusive and relevant, ultimately leading to better search results and a more satisfying user experience.",
