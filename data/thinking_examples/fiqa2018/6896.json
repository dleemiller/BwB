  "reasoning": "The query focuses on the tax implications related to the timing of stock sales/repurchases. The initial results are shallow and omit key concepts like the wash sale rule. A broader search is needed, taking into account tax regulations, investment strategies, and the timing of transactions. The conceptual map should explore tax implications, strategies for tax minimization (legally), and potential pitfalls like the wash sale rule. International differences in tax laws should be considered, though are not specifically requested by this prompt.",

  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n... A short term capital gain is gain on an investment held for less than one year. These gains are taxed at your ordinary income tax rate. A long term capital gain is gain on an investment held for more than one year. These gains are taxed at a special rate: If your income tax rate is 10 or 15%, then long term gains are taxed at 0% i.e. no tax, otherwise the tax rate is 15%. So you're not taxed on specific stock sales - you're taxed on your total gain. There is no tax for a capital loss, and investors sometimes take profits from good investments and take losses from bad investments to lower their total capital gain so they won't be taxed as much. The tax rate is expected to change in 2013, but the current ratios could be extended. Until then, however, the rate is as is.  Of course, this all applies if you live in the United States. Other countries have different measures. Hope it helps!  Wikipedia has a great chart to refer to: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_gains_tax_in_the_United_States.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: You realise a capital gain as soon as you sell the stock. At that point, you will have to pay taxes on the profits when you fill in your tax return. The fact that you used the money to subsequently purchase other stocks is not relevant, unless you sell those stocks within the same tax year. For example, purchase $5000 of stock A in 2010. Sell for $6000 in 2010. Purchase $6000 of stock B in 2010. Sell stock B for $6500 in 2010. Purchase $6500 of stock C in 2010. Sell stock C for $7000 in 2011. You owe capital gains on ($6000 - $5000) + ($6500 - $6000) = $1500 for tax year 2010. You owe capital gains on ($7000 - $6500) = $500 for 2011.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n... If you want an easy and fairly reliable way to invest, and don't want to do a lot of tax-form scrambling, choose a couple of different mutual funds, put money into them, and leave it there. They'll send you consolidated tax statements once a year. Download them into your tax program and you're done. You mentioned \"\"riding out bad times in cash.\"\"  No, no, NOT a good idea. That investment strategy almost guarantees you will sell when the market is going down and buy when it's going up. That's \"\"sell low, buy high.\"\" It's a loser. Not even Warren Buffett can call the top of the market and the bottom.  Ned Johnson (Fidelity's founder) DEFINITELY can't.\"\n",
  "thought_process": "As I delve into the query \"Selling high, pay capital gains, re-purchase later,\" my initial impression is that this user is concerned about the tax implications of selling stocks at a high price, paying capital gains tax, and then re-purchasing those or similar stocks later. This seems to involve a delicate dance between maximizing investment returns and minimizing tax liabilities. The user might be trying to understand how to navigate this process efficiently, possibly to avoid significant tax burdens or to explore legal strategies for tax minimization.\n\nUpon analyzing the initial results, it becomes clear that the original search query yields information that touches on capital gains tax, the timing of stock sales and purchases, and the implications of these actions on tax obligations. However, these results lack depth, particularly regarding the wash sale rule, tax-loss harvesting, and the strategic planning involved in managing capital gains and losses.\n\nTo approach this query more systematically, I'll apply the technique of Conceptual Territory Mapping. This involves identifying the central coordinates of the query, exploring its boundaries, pinpointing key landmarks, and then detailing the specific features within each region of the conceptual map.\n\nFirst, the central coordinates are clearly centered around capital gains tax, the process of selling and re-purchasing stocks, and the tax implications of these actions. The cardinal directions for exploration include the practical aspects of tax law, technical details of investment strategies, and social or community perspectives on managing investments and taxes.\n\nThe boundary exploration reveals neighboring domains such as financial planning, retirement planning, estate planning, and international tax laws. Notably, the wash sale rule and tax-loss harvesting are key concepts that border the initial query's territory, indicating a need to delve into these areas for a comprehensive understanding.\n\nIdentifying landmarks within this territory, we find concepts like the distinction between short-term and long-term capital gains, the concept of taxable events, and the importance of understanding the cost basis of investments. The routes or methodologies for navigating this territory include tax planning strategies, investment timing considerations, and perhaps even the use of specific investment vehicles like ETFs or mutual funds to manage tax liabilities.\n\nAs I apply the Conceptual Territory Mapping technique, I notice that my thought process is systematically covering the structured steps of the approach, yet it's also organically evolving with natural cognitive patterns. For instance, considering the wash sale rule leads me to think about substantially identical securities and how they might affect the timing of stock sales and purchases. This, in turn, reminds me of the importance of understanding the specific identification method, FIFO, and average cost basis methods for calculating gains and losses.\n\nOccasionally, I find myself taking brief tangents, such as pondering the international implications of capital gains tax or the potential benefits of tax-loss harvesting in a portfolio. However, these tangents often yield useful insights or reinforce the importance of certain concepts within the query's conceptual territory.\n\nSynthesizing this process, I realize that the expanded query \"Capital Gains Tax Wash Sale Rule Tax-Loss Harvesting Stock Repurchase Tax Implications\" effectively captures the breadth and depth of the user's concern. This expansion incorporates both the explicit aspects of managing capital gains and the implicit considerations necessary for strategic investment and tax planning. The navigation terms extracted from this process, such as capital gains, wash sale, tax-loss harvesting, and cost basis, provide a clear pathway for the user to explore the complex landscape of tax implications related to selling high and re-purchasing stocks later.\n\nThrough this structured yet intuitively guided approach, the final expanded query and its associated navigation terms emerge as a logical and comprehensive response to the user's initial query, balancing the need for technical accuracy with the organic flow of thought and exploration.",
