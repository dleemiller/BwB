  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"matt berry tv series,\" my initial impression is that the user is looking for a list of television series that Matt Berry has been involved in, possibly as an actor or writer. However, as I delve deeper, I realize that the user might be trying to understand the scope of Matt Berry's work in television, including his notable roles, the types of series he's been in, and perhaps even the genres he's associated with. \n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that there are several strengths and weaknesses in the search terms. For instance, the query \"matt berry tv series\" is quite broad and might yield a lot of irrelevant results, such as series where Matt Berry had a minor or guest role. On the other hand, the query does successfully retrieve results that highlight his central roles in series like \"Toast of London\" and his appearances in \"The IT Crowd.\" \n\nTo expand on this query effectively, I decide to use the \"Query Expansion via Multi-Disciplinary Expert Panel\" technique. This involves assembling a panel of experts from different disciplines to analyze the query and contribute their specialized knowledge. \n\nThe first step is to select the experts. For this query, I choose experts from the fields of entertainment journalism, television production, comedy writing, voice acting, and fan community moderation. Each of these disciplines brings a unique perspective to understanding Matt Berry's work in television series. \n\nDuring individual consultations, each expert analyzes the query from their disciplinary perspective. The entertainment journalist identifies key concepts like British comedy and genre conventions. The television producer notes the importance of understanding production contexts, such as budget and genre. The comedy writer highlights the role of improvisation and dry humor in Matt Berry's performances. The voice acting coach emphasizes the significance of Berry's voice acting skills. Lastly, the fan community moderator provides insights into how fans perceive and interpret Matt Berry's characters and series. \n\nThe panel discussion is where the magic happens. The experts debate different approaches to the query, identifying cross-disciplinary connections. For example, the influence of British humor on American television is discussed, as well as the evolution of comedic acting styles from stage to screen. They also highlight complementary tools and frameworks, such as analyzing Berry's filmography within historical trends in British comedy. \n\nFrom the panel discussion, several key terms emerge that can enhance the original query. These include \"British comedy,\" \"comedy writing,\" \"improvisation,\" \"dry humor,\" \"voice acting,\" and \"genre conventions.\" The experts also recommend resources such as Matt Berry's IMDB page, interviews on podcasts, academic articles on British comedy history, online forums, and behind-the-scenes documentaries. \n\nAs I synthesize the insights from the expert panel, I realize that the expanded query needs to capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking. The original query was simply \"matt berry tv series,\" but our analysis suggests that the user is likely interested in a more nuanced exploration of Matt Berry's work, including his roles in British comedy series, his comedic style, and the genres he's worked in. \n\nApplying the \"Query Expansion via Multi-Disciplinary Expert Panel\" technique leads me to the expanded query: \"matt berry television series british comedy comedic voice acting role analysis genre conventions.\" This query incorporates the key concepts identified by the expert panel and is designed to retrieve a more comprehensive set of results that reflect the full scope of Matt Berry's work in television series. \n\nThrough this process, I've seen how the structured approach of the expert panel technique complements my natural thought patterns, allowing for a more systematic and comprehensive expansion of the original query. The technique helps to ensure that no stone is left unturned, that all relevant disciplines are considered, and that the final expanded query is logical, cohesive, and effective. \n\nIn conclusion, by combining organic thinking with the structured \"Query Expansion via Multi-Disciplinary Expert Panel\" technique, we've created an expanded query that not only captures the explicit request for information on Matt Berry's TV series but also delves into the implicit aspects of his work, including his roles in British comedy, his comedic style, and the genres he's associated with. This approach demonstrates how experts can use a combination of intuition, experience, and creative connections to enhance the search process.",
