  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: Butte High School is a public high school in Butte, Montana.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: Square Butte is a name used for 11 buttes in Montana.  Two of the most prominent buttes are located in Cascade County, Montana, about 22 miles (35 km) due west of Great Falls and Chouteau County, Montana, about 50 miles (80 km) due east of Great Falls and about 15 miles (24 km) due east of the Highwood Mountains.  Charles Marion Russell, the noted Montana western artist used both features as background in his paintings of Montana.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: Butte Central Catholic High School is a private, Roman Catholic high school in Butte, Montana. It is one of two high schools in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Helena, the other being Loyola Sacred Heart in Missoula.  Their mascot is the Maroons.\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"butte montana\", this makes me think of a geographical location, but the user might actually be trying to find information about the city of Butte, Montana, rather than just the geographical formation. The initial results seem to focus on the latter, which is a misinterpretation of the user's intent. I notice that the results at k=1 and k=10 mention Butte High School and Butte Central Catholic High School, respectively, which suggests that the user is indeed looking for information about the city.\n\nAs I analyze the results, I see that the term \"butte\" is too broad and is leading to irrelevant results about geographical formations. I need to identify ineffective terms and find more specific and diverse terms to expand the query. The task outcomes provide a good starting point, with query goals that include finding information about the city's history, culture, and attractions.\n\nLet me approach this using the expansion technique, which involves applying varied augmentation techniques such as synonym replacement, conceptual expansion, and domain-specific terminology. This should help me discover new, relevant documents across various domains. I'll start by examining the original query to understand its primary objectives and gaps. The goal elucidation and gaps analysis reveal that the user is looking for information about the city of Butte, Montana, and its history, culture, and attractions.\n\nThe ineffective term identification task highlights that the term \"butte\" is too broad and should be avoided. The breadth expansion task provides a list of candidate terms with increasingly distant concepts to the original query, including \"copper mining\", \"Montana history\", \"mining towns\", \"Silver Bow County\", and \"urban development\". These terms seem relevant, but I need to go deeper to find more specific and targeted terms.\n\nThe depth expansion task allows me to choose one distant but important topic from the breadth expansion and go increasingly deeper in the related terms. I'll choose \"copper mining\" and explore related terms such as \"historic mining district\", \"Copper King\", \"Mining Museum\", \"folklore and legends\", and \"economic impact of mining\". These terms seem to capture the essence of Butte, Montana's history and culture.\n\nAs I apply the expansion technique, I'm seeing several possibilities here. Following the technique's approach, I should first identify the most relevant terms from the depth expansion. I notice that \"Copper King\" and \"Mining Museum\" are closely related to the city's history and culture. I also see that \"folklore and legends\" could provide interesting insights into the city's attractions.\n\nWait, that's not quite right for this query. Let me adjust my approach. I need to balance the structured steps with natural thought patterns. I'll take a step back and reassess the results. Ah, yes! I see that the term \"Silver Bow County\" is actually relevant to the city of Butte, Montana. And \"history\" is a broad term that could encompass the city's culture and attractions.\n\nThis step of the technique is revealing some interesting insights. The term \"Copper King\" reminds me of the city's rich mining history, which is actually a significant part of its culture. And \"Mining Museum\" seems like a great attraction that could provide more information about the city's history.\n\nI need to consider the next step in the technique, which involves applying domain-specific terminology. But I'm also noticing this interesting pattern where the city's history and culture are closely tied to its mining industry. This makes me think that terms like \"historic mining district\" and \"economic impact of mining\" could be relevant.\n\nApplying the technique's approach leads me to discover new terms like \"history\", \"Montana\", \"Silver Bow County\", \"Copper King\", \"Mining Museum\", \"folklore\", and \"legends\". These terms seem to capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking.\n\nThrough this process of applying the expansion technique and exploring related threads, I believe the augmented query should include terms that reflect the city's history, culture, and attractions. The final terms should emerge logically from both the technique and natural insights.",
