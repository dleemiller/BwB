  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query \"laura steele bob and tom\", this makes me think of a potential connection between individuals in the entertainment industry, possibly tied to a specific show or era. The user might actually be trying to find information about a person named Laura Steele and her connection to a radio or television personality named Bob, or perhaps a show called \"The Bob & Tom Show\". Initially, I'm considering how \"Bob\" could be a common name in various contexts, including radio and television, and how \"Laura Steele\" might be a unique identifier in this search.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, we have several text snippets that point towards \"Bob\" being a significant figure in radio, specifically with \"The Bob & Tom Show\". This gives us a clear direction towards radio personalities and the entertainment industry of the 1970s and beyond. However, the inclusion of \"Laura Steele\" in the query suggests we're not just looking for general information about \"Bob\" or \"The Bob & Tom Show\" but rather a specific connection or context involving Laura Steele.\n\nTransitioning to a more structured approach, I'll use the \"Query Expansion via Multi-Disciplinary Expert Panel\" technique. This involves convening a panel of experts from diverse fields such as media history, entertainment journalism, radio production, genealogy, and social media analysis. Each expert will bring unique perspectives and terminology to the table, helping to broaden and deepen our search query.\n\nStarting with the expert selection process, we identify key disciplines relevant to the query. We then create expert personas for each discipline, ensuring they have the credentials and experience to contribute meaningfully to our analysis. For instance, a media historian could provide insights into the cultural context of the 1970s entertainment industry, while an entertainment journalist might offer details on specific shows, personalities, or industry trends.\n\nIn individual consultations, each expert analyzes the query from their perspective, identifying key concepts, methodologies, and specialized vocabulary. The media historian might note the significance of radio shows during the 1970s, while the genealogist could suggest ways to research potential family connections between \"Bob\" and \"Laura Steele\". The social media analyst would look into online presence and contemporary interactions that might shed light on the query.\n\nDuring the panel discussion, experts debate different approaches, highlighting cross-disciplinary connections and complementary tools or frameworks. For example, the connection between radio broadcasting and historical context could be explored, or how social media presence might reflect or influence perceptions of individuals in the entertainment industry. This discussion helps to clarify terminology differences between fields and ensures a comprehensive understanding of the query's potential dimensions.\n\nAfter compiling recommendations from each expert, including specialized search terms and resources, we synthesize these insights into an expanded query. This query aims to capture the diverse aspects of the original query, from the entertainment industry connections and historical context to potential genealogical links and contemporary social media presence.\n\nThrough this process, applying the \"Query Expansion via Multi-Disciplinary Expert Panel\" technique leads to the identification of key terms such as \"radio personality\", \"1970s entertainment industry connections\", \"genealogy research\", and \"social media presence\". These terms, combined with the original names \"Laura Steele\" and \"Bob\", form a robust and expanded query: \"Laura Steele, Bob (radio personality), 1970s entertainment industry connections, genealogy research, social media presence\". This expanded query captures both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, leveraging the structured approach of the expert panel technique while incorporating natural cognitive elements like reconsiderations, intuitive leaps, and connections across different disciplines.",
