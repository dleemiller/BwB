  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query \"living nordic classical composers\", this makes me think of a specific geographical region and a particular genre of music. However, the terms \"living\", \"classical\", and \"composers\" seem quite broad and might not yield the most relevant results. The user might actually be trying to find contemporary classical music composers from Nordic countries, which could include Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Iceland.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the top documents don't necessarily provide a clear list of living Nordic classical composers. The first document mentions the Nordic Council Music Prize, which is awarded to a living composer every two years, but it doesn't provide a specific list of composers. The second document seems unrelated, as it lists classical music composers from Spain. The tenth document, however, mentions a Danish composer, Peter Bruun, who won the Nordic Council Music Prize in 2008.\n\nTo expand this query, I'll use a structured approach, specifically the technique of breadth and depth expansion. This technique involves identifying ineffective terms, expanding the query to include more specific and diverse terms, and then narrowing down to a specific topic to explore in more depth.\n\nThe ineffective terms in this query are \"living\", \"classical\", and \"composers\", as they are too broad and don't provide enough specificity. To expand the query, I'll consider the geographical region of Nordic countries and the genre of classical music. I'll include terms like \"Finland\", \"Sweden\", \"Denmark\", \"Norway\", and \"Iceland\" to specify the region, and terms like \"contemporary\", \"symphony\", \"concerto\", \"opera\", \"chamber\", and \"choral\" to specify the genre.\n\nFor the depth expansion, I'll choose Norway as a specific topic to explore in more depth. I'll consider terms like \"Norwegian music\", \"Norwegian composers\", \"contemporary Norwegian composers\", \"Norwegian orchestral music\", \"Norwegian symphonies\", \"Norwegian concertos\", \"modern Norwegian opera\", and \"current Norwegian chamber music\".\n\nAs I apply this technique, I notice that the terms \"Norwegian\", \"Finnish\", \"Swedish\", \"Danish\", and \"Icelandic\" are all relevant to the query, as they specify the geographical region. The terms \"orchestral\", \"symphony\", \"concerto\", \"opera\", \"chamber\", and \"choral\" are also relevant, as they specify the genre of music. Additionally, the terms \"modern\", \"contemporary\", and \"current\" are relevant, as they specify the time period of the composers.\n\nThrough this process, I've identified a set of terms that can be used to expand the query. These terms include \"Norwegian\", \"Finnish\", \"Swedish\", \"Danish\", \"Icelandic\", \"orchestral\", \"symphony\", \"concerto\", \"opera\", \"chamber\", \"choral\", \"modern\", \"contemporary\", and \"current\". By combining these terms, I can create an augmented query that is more specific and diverse than the original query.\n\nThe augmented query is: \"Norwegian Finnish Swedish Danish Icelandic orchestral symphony concerto opera chamber choral modern contemporary current\". This query includes a mix of geographical terms, genre-specific terms, and time-period specific terms, which should yield more relevant results than the original query.\n\nAs I reflect on this process, I realize that the technique of breadth and depth expansion has helped me to identify a set of relevant terms that can be used to expand the query. By analyzing the results of the original query and applying this technique, I've been able to create an augmented query that is more specific and diverse than the original query. This query should yield more relevant results and provide a better understanding of living Nordic classical composers.",
