  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: German Cornejo & Gisela Galeassi are an Argentinan Tango dance duo. They have been dancing together since early 2011 currently dancing for The Tango Fire Company of Buenos Aires for which German Cornejo is the current Director of Choreography. In 2003 and 2005 the duo were World Tango Champions.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: NeoTango is a distinct genre of Tango which goes beyond it both in music and in dance. The music is a container of tracks from all over the World, instrumental or vocal, clearly distinct from the tango that preceded it because it includes only modern music, everything which was recorded in the last 30/40 years and which can be danced using the tango biomechanics. As a dance form it is currently evolving. It is the 'living' globalized tango dance form of the 21st Century.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: Ronda (Spanish \"la ronda\" for \"the ring\" or \"the round\") refers to the line of dance in Argentine Tango. Similar to ballroom dancing the traditional ronda requires the dance couples to move counter clockwise around the room.  This enables many couples to share the floor in social dance situations.\n",
  "thought_process": "As I delve into the query \"tango dance history,\" my initial impressions are of a rich and diverse dance form with roots in Argentina and Uruguay. I think about the iconic images of tango dancers, the passionate music, and the dramatic movements. However, I also consider that the user might be looking for more than just a brief overview; they might want to understand the evolution of tango, its cultural significance, and its current state.\n\nAnalyzing the initial results, I notice that the top documents provide a mix of information on tango dance, its history, and its various forms. The first snippet mentions German Cornejo & Gisela Galeassi, a renowned tango dance duo, which gives me a glimpse into the contemporary tango scene. The second snippet introduces the concept of NeoTango, a modern genre that has evolved from traditional tango, which suggests that tango is a dynamic and evolving art form. The third snippet discusses the ronda, a fundamental aspect of Argentine Tango, highlighting the social and communal nature of the dance.\n\nTo expand the query, I decide to apply the Temporal Evolution Analysis technique. This involves tracing the historical development of tango, identifying key milestones, and projecting its future evolution. I start by extracting foundational concepts and terminology from the historical period, such as Rio de la Plata, Compadritos, and Milonga. I then move on to the developmental milestones, including the influence of European immigration, the rise of organized crime, and the Golden Age of Tango.\n\nAs I apply the technique, I notice that the terminology and concepts used in tango have transformed over time. I see how the traditional tango has given rise to new forms, such as Nuevo Tango and Fusion Tango, which are popular in modern milongas. I also consider the current landscape, including the global spread of tango, the rise of online communities, and the increasing focus on inclusivity and diversity.\n\nThe Temporal Evolution Analysis technique helps me to systematically extract terms from each time period, including historical, developmental, and contemporary terminology. I identify terms that have remained relevant across eras, such as Milonga and Orquestas T\u00edpicas, and select terms that provide historical context or future relevance, like Neo Tango and Fusion Tango.\n\nThrough this process, I begin to see a timeline of tango's evolution, from its roots in the Rio de la Plata region to its current global popularity. I realize that the expanded query should capture the full temporal spectrum of tango, including its historical foundation, developmental milestones, and emerging trends.\n\nAs I synthesize the information, I consider how the structure of the Temporal Evolution Analysis technique has complemented my natural thought patterns. The technique has helped me to systematically analyze the evolution of tango, while my intuition and experience have allowed me to make connections between seemingly disparate concepts. I see how the traditional tango has influenced the modern forms, and how the contemporary scene is shaped by historical and cultural factors.\n\nThe final expanded query, \"tango dance history rio de la plata compadritos milonga canyengue guardia vieja orquestas t\u00edpicas golden age nuevo tango milongas neo tango fusion tango,\" reflects the full temporal spectrum of tango, from its historical roots to its current global popularity. This query should provide a comprehensive overview of tango's evolution, capturing both the explicit and implicit aspects of the user's search query.",
