  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query 'eagle rock, ca', this makes me think of a geographic location, possibly a city or neighborhood, but the user might actually be trying to find specific information about it, such as attractions, restaurants, or real estate. Hmm, not sure yet what the primary intent is. The query is quite broad and could apply to various aspects of Eagle Rock, California.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the top hits include information about the Center for the Arts Eagle Rock, Eagle Rock High School, and somewhat unrelated content about Filipa Moniz Perestrelo, which seems out of context. This suggests that the search terms might not be specific enough to yield relevant results for what the user is actually looking for. The strengths of these search terms lie in their simplicity and direct reference to the location, but their weakness is the lack of specificity regarding the user's intent.\n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here, but to streamline my approach, I'll use the query expansion technique via user intent and journey mapping. This involves creating distinct user personas, analyzing their search vocabulary, mapping their information journey, identifying contextual scenarios, and extracting intent-revealing terms. By doing so, I hope to capture a broader spectrum of potential user intents and tailor the query to better match what users are likely seeking.\n\nLet's start with user personas. We have the Novice Traveler looking for general information, the Local Resident seeking community events or historical landmarks, the Real Estate Enthusiast researching property values, and the History Buff interested in the origins and cultural significance of Eagle Rock. Each persona has unique search vocabulary and information needs at different stages of their journey.\n\nFor the Novice Traveler, initial searches might include 'eagle rock california' or 'things to do eagle rock', progressing to more specific queries like 'best restaurants near eagle rock' as they plan their trip. The Local Resident might start with 'eagle rock events calendar' and move towards 'history of eagle rock' as they delve deeper into community aspects. The Real Estate Enthusiast's queries would likely revolve around 'eagle rock homes for sale', 'average home price eagle rock', and 'schools in eagle rock'. The History Buff would be interested in 'eagle rock origins', 'early settlers eagle rock', and 'architectural history eagle rock'.\n\nAs I apply this technique, I notice that certain terms keep appearing across different personas and journey stages, such as 'location information', 'things to do', 'restaurants', 'real estate', 'history', and 'community'. These terms seem to capture the essence of what users are looking for when querying 'eagle rock, ca'. However, to ensure our expanded query is effective, we need to balance these general terms with more specific intent-revealing terms that reflect the diverse needs of our personas.\n\nFollowing the query expansion technique, I should first identify high-value terms across the expertise spectrum. For Eagle Rock, these might include 'attractions', 'landmarks', 'neighborhood', 'home prices', and 'demographics' for a more general search, and 'architectural styles', 'early industrial history', and 'local folklore' for more specialized queries.\n\nAs I step back to reassess, I realize that our expanded query needs to reflect both the explicit and implicit aspects of user intent. By combining terms like 'eagle rock', 'california', 'restaurants', 'attractions', we start to get a query that could cater to a variety of user needs, from the Novice Traveler to the History Buff. The inclusion of 'restaurants' and 'attractions' directly addresses the needs of travelers and locals alike, while 'california' ensures the query is location-specific.\n\nThrough this process of applying the query expansion technique and exploring related threads, I believe the terms that would be most effective for expanding the query are indeed 'eagle rock', 'california', 'restaurants', and 'attractions'. These terms capture the core of what users are likely seeking\u2014information about Eagle Rock, California, with a focus on experiences and places to visit. The final expanded query, 'eagle rock california restaurants attractions', seems to logically emerge from both the structured technique and natural insights into user behavior and intent.",
