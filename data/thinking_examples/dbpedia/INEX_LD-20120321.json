  "thought_process": "When I first look at the query \"tango music composers,\" my initial impression is that the user is looking for a list of notable composers who have contributed to the tango music genre. However, as I delve deeper, I consider the possibility that the user might be seeking more than just a list of names - perhaps they're interested in understanding the evolution of tango music, the styles of different composers, or even the cultural context in which tango music emerged.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the top documents provide information on specific composers, such as Juan Carlos Cobi\u00e1n and Mario Abramovich, as well as musical groups like Tanghetto, which blends tango with electronic music. These results suggest that the user is looking for a mix of historical and contemporary information, as well as an understanding of the various styles and sub-genres within tango music.\n\nTo expand this query, I'll employ the technique of user intent and journey mapping. This involves creating user personas with varying expertise levels and goals, analyzing their search vocabulary, and mapping their information journey to identify key terms and concepts.\n\nI start by creating four user personas: the Tango Enthusiast (novice), the Music Scholar (intermediate), the Composer's Family Historian (advanced), and the Professional Tango Performer (expert). Each persona has unique goals, motivations, and prior knowledge, which influence their search vocabulary and information needs.\n\nFor example, the Tango Enthusiast might start with general search terms like \"tango music\" or \"famous tango composers,\" while the Music Scholar might use more specific terms like \"tango composition techniques\" or \"influence of European classical music on tango.\" The Composer's Family Historian might search for information on specific composers, such as \"Juan Carlos Cobi\u00e1n biography,\" and the Professional Tango Performer might look for terms like \"tango music sheets\" or \"tango dance choreography.\"\n\nAs I map the information journey of these personas, I identify key stages, such as introduction to tango music, exploring key composers and their influences, diving deep into composition techniques, and comparative analysis of various styles. I also consider the specific scenarios where users need this information, such as researching for a university paper, planning a themed event, or curating a playlist.\n\nThrough this process, I extract high-value terms and concepts that reflect the diverse needs and expertise levels of potential users. These terms include \"tango composers,\" \"classic tango musicians,\" \"neo-tango artists,\" \"history of tango composition,\" and \"greatest composers.\" I also identify intent-revealing terminology, such as \"influential figures,\" \"musical heritage,\" \"comprehensive overview,\" and \"contemporary influences.\"\n\nBy applying the user intent and journey mapping technique, I can create an expanded query that captures the complexity and nuance of the user's information needs. The resulting query, \"Exploring the impact and contributions of renowned tango composers throughout history, from classic masters to neo-tango innovators. How have these figures influenced the evolution of tango music?\" reflects the diverse perspectives and expertise levels of potential users, ensuring that search results cater to a wide range of needs and contexts.\n\nThroughout this process, I've balanced structured thinking with natural cognitive patterns, allowing me to make connections between different concepts and identify patterns that might not have been immediately apparent. By combining the systematic approach of user intent and journey mapping with my own intuitive insights and expertise, I've created an expanded query that is both comprehensive and relevant to the user's needs.",
