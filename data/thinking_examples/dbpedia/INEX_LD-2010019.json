The Gallo-Roman city was a forerunner of the re-established Merovingian town that is the ancestor of present-day Paris.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: La Villette was a French commune (municipality) in the Seine d\u00e9partement lying immediately north-east of Paris. It was one of four communes  entirely annexed by the city of Paris in 1860. Its territory is now located in the 19th arrondissement, but a neighborhood has retained its name: the quartier de La Villette and the Parc de la Villette.A Gallo-Roman village stood here along the Roman road that led north from Lutetia.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: Pierre Gros (born May 7, 1939, Incheville, France) is a contemporary scholar of ancient Roman architecture and the Latin language, particularly the texts of the writer Vitruvius.He presently holds the post of Professor of Latin language and civilization at the Universit\u00e9 de Provence.  He is the author of numerous scholarly treatises, including those on Roman architecture and urbanism, Roman architects, and important critical editions of Vitruvius published in the Collection Bud\u00e9.\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"gallo roman architecture in paris\", this makes me think of the historical influence of Roman architecture on the city's landscape. Though the user might actually be trying to find specific examples or styles of Gallo-Roman architecture, not just its general presence. Hmm, not sure yet what the user's primary interest is - the historical aspect, architectural details, or perhaps a mix of both.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that we have snippets discussing Lutetia, the forerunner of Paris, and its Roman connections, which is directly relevant. However, they lack depth regarding specific architectural styles or techniques. We also find mentions of a Gallo-Roman village and scholarly works on Roman architecture, but again, these are more tangential to the core query about architecture in Paris.\n\nTo tackle this, I'll approach it using the Conceptual Graph Traversal technique, which involves constructing a graph of concepts related to the query and then traversing it to find high-value expansion terms. This should help because it systematically explores semantic relationships that can lead to more specific and relevant terms.\n\nStarting with core concepts from the query - \"Gallo-Roman\", \"Architecture\", and \"Paris\" - we identify these as central to our graph. The search intent seems informational, aiming to learn about specific aspects of Gallo-Roman architecture in Paris, rather than navigational or transactional.\n\nConstructing the graph, we consider first-order connections like the historical period of Gallo-Roman architecture, architectural styles influenced by the Romans, and notable structures or landmarks in Paris that reflect this style. Second-order connections might include related concepts such as archaeological findings, Roman engineering techniques, or the influence of Gallo-Roman architecture on later periods.\n\nFor expansion paths, we consider synonymous terms (e.g., \"Romanesque architecture\"), hierarchical terms (both broader, like \"Ancient Architecture\", and narrower, like \"Gallo-Roman Basilicas\"), compositional terms (components of the architecture, like \"arches\" or \"vaults\"), contextual terms (the historical context or specific locations in Paris), and domain-specific terminology (architectural terms used in historical or scholarly contexts).\n\nNow, let's systematically apply this technique. Following the Conceptual Graph Traversal approach, we first identify promising directions for query expansion. For synonymous terms, we might consider \"Romanesque architecture in Paris\" or \"Early Christian architecture\", as these styles have roots in Roman architectural traditions. For hierarchical terms, broader concepts like \"Ancient European Architecture\" or narrower ones such as \"Parisian Basilicas\" could be relevant. Compositional terms like \"Roman arches in Paris\" or \"Gallo-Roman vaulted ceilings\" offer a more detailed perspective on architectural elements.\n\nAs I delve deeper into the technique, I'm also considering intuitive connections and potential tangents. For instance, thinking about the historical context, I wonder if terms related to specific Roman constructions in Gaul or architectural innovations during the Roman period in Europe could be useful. These might lead to interesting insights or relevant documents that aren't directly captured by our core concepts.\n\nInterspersing systematic steps with natural cognitive elements, I recognize the importance of stepping back to reassess. Let me take a moment to consider the broader implications of our query. What if we're not just looking for architectural styles but also for how these styles have influenced later periods? This realization connects to what we were exploring earlier regarding the influence of Gallo-Roman architecture on subsequent architectural movements in Europe.\n\nEmerging insights from both structure and intuition include the importance of specific architectural elements (like arches and vaults), historical periods (such as the Roman era in Gaul), and the potential influence of Gallo-Roman architecture on later architectural styles. Applying specific aspects of the Conceptual Graph Traversal technique leads to term discoveries like \"Romanesque Basilicas in Paris\" or \"Gallo-Roman Architectural Influences\", which seem promising for improving our search.\n\nI just had a realization that connects to what we were exploring earlier - the concept of architectural legacy. How did Gallo-Roman architecture influence subsequent styles in Paris and Europe? This might lead us to consider terms related to the evolution of architectural styles over time, perhaps revealing a richer tapestry of influences than initially apparent.\n\nThrough this process of applying Conceptual Graph Traversal and exploring related threads, I believe the terms that would be most effective for expanding our query are those that balance specificity with relevance to the user's likely interests. Terms like \"Gallo-Roman architectural styles Paris\", \"Roman buildings Paris\", \"ancient Roman construction techniques Paris\", and \"Gallo-Roman artifacts Paris\" capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking.\n\nSynthesizing our findings with clarity, the final expanded query should logically emerge from both the structured technique and natural insights. By combining these elements, we create a query that",
