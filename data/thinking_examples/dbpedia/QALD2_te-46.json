  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"Which professional surfers were born on the Philippines?\" this makes me think of the rich cultural heritage and the vibrant surfing scene in the Philippines, though the user might actually be trying to find specific biographical information about Filipino surfers. The initial results, however, seem broad and lack focus on Filipino surfers or a strong connection to surfing specifically. \n\nAnalyzing these results, I notice that they are more about professional surfers from other parts of the world, such as Australia and Hawaii, with no direct mention of the Philippines. This tells me that the original query might not have been specific enough or that the search terms might not have been accurately capturing the essence of what the user is looking for. The strengths of the search terms lie in their ability to retrieve information about professional surfers, but the weakness is in their lack of specificity towards Filipino surfers.\n\nTo improve these results, I'll transition to a more structured approach using the Conceptual Territory Mapping technique. This involves treating the query as a knowledge cartographer would, mapping out the conceptual territory surrounding the topic. The first step is to identify the central coordinates of the query, which in this case would be \"Filipino Surfers\" and \"Professional Surfing.\" Establishing the cardinal directions, I consider both the practical and theoretical aspects of surfing, as well as the technical and social dimensions of being a professional surfer in the Philippines.\n\nAs I explore the boundaries of this territory, I chart the neighboring domains such as Asian Surfing Culture, Philippine Sports History, and World Surf League Rankings. Noting areas where these territories overlap or connect, I realize the importance of understanding the local context and how it influences the careers and biographies of Filipino professional surfers.\n\nIdentifying landmarks within this territory, I plot significant locations like Siargao Island, known for its surfing scene, and key figures such as Gerry Lopez, a legendary surfer who might have connections or insights into the Philippine surfing community. I also consider the role of the Philippine Surfing Association in promoting and governing surfing in the country.\n\nIn the detail mapping phase, I delve into specialized features such as local surfing styles, major surf breaks in the Philippines, and training academies for Filipino surfers. This level of detail helps in understanding the nuanced environment in which professional Filipino surfers operate and how these factors contribute to their biographies and careers.\n\nAs I create a cartographic legend, I select terms that are crucial for navigating this knowledge landscape. Terms like \"Filipino,\" \"Surfer,\" \"Biography,\" \"Siargao,\" and \"Philippine Surfing Association\" emerge as key navigation terms. These terms not only help in refining the search query but also in understanding the broader context of professional surfing in the Philippines.\n\nThrough this process of applying Conceptual Territory Mapping and exploring related threads, I believe the terms that would be most effective for a BM25 index are those that capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, such as \"professional surfers born in the Philippines,\" \"biographical details,\" and \"Siargao Island surfing scene.\" These terms, derived from both the structured technique and natural insights, should lead to more focused and relevant search results.",
