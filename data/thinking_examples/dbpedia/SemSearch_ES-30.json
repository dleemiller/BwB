Also known as an \"unsecured line of credit\".\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: A line of credit is credit source extended to a government, business or individual by a bank or other financial institution. A line of credit may take several forms, such as  overdraft protection, demand loan, special purpose, export packing credit, term loan, discounting, purchase of commercial bills, traditional revolving credit card account, etc. It is effectively a source of funds that can readily be tapped at the borrower's discretion. Interest is paid only on money actually withdrawn.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: An external commercial borrowing (ECB) is an instrument used in India to facilitate the access to foreign money by Indian corporations and PSUs (public sector undertakings).ECBs include commercial bank loans, buyers' credit, suppliers' credit, securitised instruments such as floating rate notes and fixed rate bonds etc., credit from official export credit agencies and commercial borrowings from the private sector window of multilateral financial Institutions such as International Finance Corporation (Washington), ADB, AFIC, CDC, etc.ECBs cannot be used for investment in stock market or speculation in real estate.\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query \"eLoan line of credit,\" this makes me think of financial products and the ways in which individuals and businesses can access funds. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the specifics of what eLoan offers in terms of lines of credit, I need to consider the broader context of financial lending and the various types of credit products available. Hmm, not sure yet what specific aspects of eLoan's line of credit the user is most interested in, but it seems like they're looking for detailed information.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that they're too broad and don't address the user's need for specific information about eLoan's line of credit offerings. The text snippets from the initial results provide some general information about lines of credit, such as the definition of a signature line of credit and the various forms a line of credit can take. However, they don't offer the specific details about eLoan that the user is seeking.\n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here, but to approach this systematically, I'll use the Query Expansion Through Journalistic Investigation technique. This involves treating the query as if I'm researching a comprehensive story on the subject. Let me break it down:\n\n1. **Query Assessment**: The user is seeking specific information about eLoan's line of credit, including types, eligibility, interest rates, fees, and the application process. There's an assumption that eLoan offers unique or specific line of credit products that the user wants to understand.\n\n2. **Real-World Contexts**: This query is relevant in several real-world scenarios, such as when an individual is considering financial options for a large purchase or when a business is looking to manage cash flow. It's also relevant in educational settings where financial literacy is taught and in professional contexts where financial advisors might recommend lines of credit to clients.\n\n3. **Resource Investigation**: To find authoritative information, I would look for resources from eLoan directly, as well as financial experts and organizations that specialize in personal and business finance. Notable experts in finance and banking would be valuable sources, as would established methodologies for evaluating credit products.\n\n4. **Headline Creation**: Creating headlines that could introduce articles about eLoan lines of credit from multiple angles helps to identify key terms and concepts. For example, \"A Beginner's Guide to eLoan Lines of Credit,\" \"How to Apply for an eLoan Line of Credit,\" \"Comparing eLoan Lines of Credit to Other Lenders,\" and \"Understanding the Fees and Interest Rates of eLoan Lines of Credit.\"\n\n5. **Term Extraction**: From these headlines and the initial analysis, specific terms can be extracted that represent precise concepts related to the query. These include \"eLoan,\" \"lines of credit,\" \"eligibility criteria,\" \"interest rates,\" \"fees,\" \"application process,\" and \"creditworthiness.\"\n\nFollowing the Query Expansion Through Journalistic Investigation approach, I should first identify the core needs behind the query, which are to understand the specifics of eLoan's line of credit offerings. Wait, that's not quite right for this query; let me adjust my focus to also consider comparative analysis with other lenders and educational resources on financial literacy.\n\nThis step of the technique is revealing the importance of understanding not just what eLoan offers but also how it compares to other financial products. Which actually reminds me of the concept of credit scores and how they impact eligibility for lines of credit, a related concept that might also be relevant to the user's query.\n\nI need to consider the next step in the technique, which involves looking at real-world scenarios where this information would be useful. I'm also noticing an interesting pattern where the application process for lines of credit can significantly vary between lenders, which could be a crucial point for someone considering an eLoan line of credit.\n\nApplying the specific aspect of the technique related to resource investigation leads me to discover terms like \"creditworthiness\" and \"approval criteria,\" which are essential for understanding how eLoan determines eligibility for its line of credit products.\n\nI just had a realization that connects to what we were exploring earlier; the user's query is not just about the product itself but also about making an informed decision regarding their financial situation. Following the technique pointed me toward the concept of \"fees\" associated with lines of credit, but my instinct says we should also consider the long-term implications of taking out a line of credit, such as how it might affect credit scores over time.\n\nThrough this process of applying the Query Expansion Through Journalistic Investigation technique and exploring related threads, I believe the terms that would be most effective for expanding the query are those that directly address the user's need for specific, comparative, and educational information about eLoan lines of credit. These terms capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, providing a comprehensive approach to understanding eLoan's line of credit offerings.",
