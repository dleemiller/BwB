  "reasoning": "The query is \"Movies with eight or more Academy Awards\". The goal is to retrieve movie titles that have won a significant number of Academy Awards, specifically eight or more. The current results are weak because they mention \"Academy Award\" but fail to list the movies themselves, indicating a need for greater precision and focus on actual winners.\n\nI will accomplish this by creating a conceptual graph that centers on \"Academy Awards\" and \"movies\". Then, I will traverse the graph to find related terms like \"Best Picture\", \"winning films lists\", \"award history\" and \"academy award wins by movie\". This will help find specific titles and quantify the number of awards won by each.",

  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: This is a list of movies that have won the most Academy Awards at their respective ceremonies.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: The Africa Movie Academy Awards, popularly known as AMAA and The AMA Awards, are presented annually to recognize excellence of professionals in the film industry.

  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"Movies with eight or more Academy Awards\", this makes me think of prestigious films that have garnered significant recognition within the film industry. Though the user might actually be trying to find a comprehensive list of award-winning movies, the key focus here seems to be on the quantity of awards rather than just the quality or the type of awards. Hmm, not sure yet how to capture this nuance in the search query.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that while they mention \"Academy Award\", they fail to specifically list movies that have won eight or more awards. This indicates a weakness in the current search terms and a need for greater precision and focus on actual winners. The text snippets provided from the initial results show a mix of relevant and somewhat irrelevant information. For instance, the first snippet seems directly relevant as it discusses movies with the most Academy Awards, but the subsequent snippets divert into other award ceremonies, which, while related to the film industry, do not directly address the query's specific criteria.\n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here, but let me approach this using the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal technique, which involves constructing a conceptual graph around the core concepts of \"Academy Awards\" and \"movies\" and then traversing this graph to find related terms that can enhance the query. This should help because it allows for a systematic exploration of concepts related to the original query, potentially uncovering more precise and relevant search terms.\n\nFollowing the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal approach, I should first identify the core concepts and entities in the original query. Here, we have \"movies\" and \"Academy Awards\" as central, with the condition of \"eight or more\" awards being crucial. Wait, that's not quite right for this query; I need to adjust my focus towards not just any movies but specifically those recognized by the Academy Awards.\n\nThis step of the technique is revealing the importance of terms like \"Best Picture winners\" and \"Most Academy Awards won by a single film\". Which actually reminds me of related concepts that might also be relevant, such as \"award history\" and \"films with multiple Academy Awards\". I need to consider how these can be integrated into the query to make it more specific and effective.\n\nApplying the specific aspect of the technique that involves identifying synonymous, hierarchical, compositional, and contextual terms leads me to discover \"winning films lists\" and \"academy award wins by movie\". These terms seem directly relevant and could significantly enhance the query's ability to retrieve lists of movies that have won eight or more Academy Awards.\n\nThrough this process of applying Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal and exploring related threads, I believe the terms \"movies\", \"Academy Awards\", \"Best Picture winners\", \"Most Academy Awards\", \"winning films lists\", \"academy award wins by movie\", and \"eight or more\" would be most effective for enhancing the query. They capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, which is a comprehensive and precise list of movies that have achieved a high level of recognition by winning eight or more Academy Awards.",
