  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"Who are the parents of the wife of Juan Carlos I?\" - this makes me think of the complexities of royal lineage and the need for specificity in such queries. The user might actually be trying to understand more about the Spanish royal family, particularly the family of Juan Carlos I's wife, but without more context, it's a bit challenging to pinpoint exactly what they're looking for. \n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, it's clear that the term \"Juan Carlos\" is too broad, leading to information about various individuals with that name, including the King of Spain, but not specifically about his wife or her parents. The initial results highlight the importance of identifying the full name of Juan Carlos I's wife and then finding her parents.\n\nTo approach this query expansion systematically, I'll use the Expansion Technique, which involves identifying ineffective terms, performing breadth expansion, and then depth expansion. This technique should help because it allows for a structured way to explore related concepts and identify relevant terms that are not immediately obvious from the original query.\n\nFirst, let's identify the ineffective terms: \"Juan Carlos\" is clearly too broad and doesn't lead directly to information about his wife or her parents. For breadth expansion, we consider concepts like \"Spanish Royalty,\" \"European Monarchies,\" \"20th Century Queens,\" and notably, \"Sofia of Greece,\" who is known to be the wife of Juan Carlos I. This gives us a starting point to dive deeper.\n\nApplying the depth expansion technique, focusing on \"Sofia of Greece,\" we explore related terms such as \"Greek Royal Family,\" \"King Paul I of the Hellenes,\" \"Queen Frederica of Greece,\" and the \"Mountbatten family.\" These terms are directly related to Sofia's lineage and provide the specific information the original query seeks.\n\nNow, let's balance this structured approach with some natural thought patterns. If we're looking for the parents of Sofia of Greece, we should definitely consider her father, King Paul I, and her mother, Queen Frederica. The mention of the Mountbatten family is also relevant due to Queen Frederica's lineage. This connection to the Mountbatten family adds a layer of depth to our understanding of Sofia's ancestry.\n\nAs I apply the technique's steps systematically, I notice that the term \"Sofia of Greece\" acts as a pivotal point. It's not just about replacing synonyms or expanding contextually but understanding the specific relationships within royal families. This reminds me of how interconnected European royal families are, which often leads to complex lineage trails.\n\nStepping back to reassess, I realize that the key to this query lies in specificity and understanding the direct relationships between the individuals mentioned. By focusing on \"Sofia of Greece\" and then exploring her immediate family, we can accurately identify her parents as King Paul I and Queen Frederica of Greece.\n\nThe insights emerging from both the structured technique and my intuition highlight the importance of targeted expansions. Applying the specific aspect of the technique focusing on Sofia of Greece leads to the discovery of her parents. My instinct also suggests considering the broader context of European monarchies, but the primary goal is to identify the parents of Juan Carlos I's wife accurately.\n\nThrough this process of applying the Expansion Technique and exploring related threads, I believe the terms that would be most effective for a query are those that directly relate to Sofia of Greece and her family, such as \"Sofia of Greece,\" \"King Paul I,\" \"Queen Frederica,\" and \"Mountbatten.\" These terms capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking regarding the parents of Juan Carlos I's wife.",
