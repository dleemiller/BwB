As of 2014, Fitzgerald Auto Malls ranked number 59 on the list of the \"Top 125 Dealership Groups\" in the U.S., which is published annually by Automotive News Fitzgerald dealer locations appear five times on the 2013 WardsAuto e-Dealer 100, at No.8, No.25, No.30, No.43 and No.98.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: Chambersburg Mall is a regional shopping mall located near Chambersburg, Pennsylvania in the unincorporated community of Scotland.

The mall was the largest shopping center in the Treasure Valley until 1988 when the Boise Towne Square Mall was opened in Boise.

  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query \"fitzgerald auto mall chambersburg pa\", my initial impression is that the user is searching for a specific auto mall in Chambersburg, PA, owned by Fitzgerald. However, the broad nature of the term \"Fitzgerald\" might lead to irrelevant results. This makes me think of how to narrow down the search while still capturing the essence of what the user is looking for.\n\nUpon analyzing the initial results, it becomes clear that the term \"Fitzgerald\" is indeed too broad, as it could refer to various entities beyond just the auto mall in question. The text snippets from the top results show that while some are relevant to the auto mall industry, others are completely off-topic, such as the Chambersburg Mall and Karcher Mall. This strengthens the need to refine the search query to specifically target automobile dealerships in Chambersburg, PA, and potentially other related terms that can help pinpoint Fitzgerald Auto Mall.\n\nTo approach this systematically, I will apply the expansion technique guidelines provided, which emphasize being specific and diverse, and applying varied augmentation techniques such as synonym replacement, conceptual expansion, contextual expansion, and domain-specific terminology. The first step is to elucidate the goals and gaps in the original query. The primary objective is to find Fitzgerald Auto Mall in Chambersburg, PA, but the gap lies in the broadness of the search terms used.\n\nNext, identifying ineffective terms is crucial. \"Fitzgerald\" is too broad and could lead to many irrelevant results. Thus, it should be avoided or modified to be more specific. The term \"auto mall\" is somewhat generic and could be replaced with more specific terms related to automobile dealerships.\n\nFor breadth expansion, considering terms like \"automobile dealer\", \"car lot\", \"used cars\", \"new cars\", \"Pennsylvania automotive industry\", \"Chambersburg businesses\", \"dealership group\", and \"auto sales\" could help expand the search to capture more relevant results without duplicating the original query's limitations.\n\nDrilling deeper into one of these areas, such as \"dealership group\", could provide more targeted results. This depth expansion could involve terms like \"automotive franchises\", \"Ford dealerships\", \"GM dealerships\", and \"Chrysler dealerships\", which are directly related to the types of businesses that might be part of or competitors to Fitzgerald Auto Mall.\n\nAs I apply these steps, I notice that the process of expanding the query in both breadth and depth helps to reveal new dimensions of what the user might be looking for. It's not just about finding a specific business but also understanding the context and related industries or services. This realization leads me to consider how these expanded terms might interact with each other and with the original query's intent.\n\nThrough this systematic approach combined with natural intuition and insights from the initial results, I start to see a clearer path to a more effective search query. The goal is to balance specificity with diversity, ensuring that the new query captures the essence of the original search while avoiding its pitfalls.\n\nBy focusing on specific automobile dealerships in Chambersburg, PA, and considering the broader context of the automotive industry in that region, I believe it's possible to craft a query that is both novel and highly relevant. The key is to find the right balance between being specific enough to exclude irrelevant results and being broad enough to include all potential aspects of what the user is seeking.\n\nThe final step involves synthesizing these insights into a coherent and effective search query. By considering the outcomes of both the breadth and depth expansions, and ensuring that the terms selected are unique, targeted, and relevant, I can construct an augmented query that better serves the user's needs.\n\nThrough this process of applying the expansion technique, balancing structured steps with natural thought patterns, and ensuring that the final terms emerge logically from both the technique and natural insights, I arrive at an understanding of how to effectively expand the original query.",
