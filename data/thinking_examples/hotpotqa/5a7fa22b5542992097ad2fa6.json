It was recorded by Kaempfert on Polydor Records and released in the United States on Decca Records, but failed to chart. That same year, Billy Vaughn recorded it, and his cover reached number 13 on the \"Billboard\" charts that summer.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: Berthold Heinrich K\u00e4mpfert, (16 October 1923 \u2013 21 June 1980), better known as Bert Kaempfert, was a German orchestra leader, music producer, and songwriter. He made easy listening and jazz-oriented records and wrote the music for a number of well-known songs, including \"Strangers in the Night\" and \"Moon Over Naples\".\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: \"Hold On\" is a song written and first recorded by the Canadian singer and songwriter Ian Thomas, on his 1981 album \"The Runner\".\n",
  "thought_process": "As I begin to expand the query \"A Swingin' Safari\" was a song written originally by German songwriter Bert Kaempfert but made popular by who, my initial impression is that this is a question about music history, specifically about the popularization of a song. The user is looking for the artist who made \"A Swingin' Safari\" famous, but the query doesn't provide enough information to directly answer this question. My first association is with the genre of instrumental jazz, as the song title suggests a lively, upbeat tune. However, without more context, it's challenging to pinpoint the exact artist responsible for its popularity.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that some texts mention Billy Vaughn, which could be a potential answer. Nevertheless, these results don't explicitly state his role in making the song famous, leaving some ambiguity. The initial query seems to lack specificity, using broad terms like \"song\" and \"written,\" which might not be effective in yielding targeted results.\n\nTo transition into a more structured approach, I decide to apply a technique that involves expanding the query through synonym replacement, conceptual expansion, and contextual expansion. This technique, which we can call \"Domain-Specific Augmentation,\" aims to introduce new dimensions to the query while avoiding generic terms. By focusing on targeted expansions, I hope to discover new, relevant documents across various domains without overlapping the original terms.\n\nFollowing the Domain-Specific Augmentation technique, my first step is to elucidate the query's primary objectives and identify gaps. The primary objective is clear: find the artist who popularized \"A Swingin' Safari.\" A significant gap is the lack of specificity regarding the genre and era, which are crucial for pinpointing the correct artist. \n\nNext, I identify ineffective terms that should be avoided. Terms like \"song\" and \"written\" are too broad and don't add much value to the query. They can be omitted or replaced with more specific terms related to the genre or the act of popularizing a piece of music.\n\nFor breadth expansion, I consider terms that are increasingly distant from the original query but still relevant. This includes concepts like \"instrumental music,\" \"jazz standards,\" \"1960s popular music,\" \"big band,\" and \"lounge music.\" These terms help to contextualize the query within a specific musical genre and era.\n\nThen, I proceed to depth expansion, choosing one distant but important topic from the breadth expansion and exploring related terms in more depth. The topic of \"instrumental jazz musicians\" from the 1960s seems particularly relevant. Terms like \"popular instrumental artists 1960s,\" \"Billy Vaughn era performers,\" and \"easy listening pioneers\" start to emerge as highly relevant. These terms not only specify the genre and era but also introduce specific artists and styles that were popular during that time.\n\nAs I apply the Domain-Specific Augmentation technique, I start to see connections between the original query and the expanded terms. The technique reveals insights such as the importance of instrumental jazz in the 1960s and the role of artists like Billy Vaughn in popularizing certain genres. My intuition also plays a role, as I consider how these terms might relate to the broader context of music history and the specific question about \"A Swingin' Safari.\"\n\nThrough this process, I start to formulate an augmented query that captures the essence of my thought process. The terms \"Billy Vaughn,\" \"instrumental jazz,\" \"1960s,\" and \"easy listening\" emerge as key components. These terms are specific, diverse, unique, and relevant to the original query, ensuring that the augmented query will yield non-overlapping and targeted results.\n\nSynthesizing my findings, I conclude that the augmented query should include terms that reflect the genre, era, and specific artists associated with the popularization of \"A Swingin' Safari.\" The final augmented query, \"Billy Vaughn instrumental jazz 1960s easy listening,\" captures the insights gained from both the structured technique and my natural thought patterns. This query is novel, free from overlapping the original terms, and designed to discover new, relevant documents across various domains.",
