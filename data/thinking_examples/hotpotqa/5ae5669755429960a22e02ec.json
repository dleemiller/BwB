To Trump opponents, it refers to members of the Republican Party that have chosen to support Donald Trump's candidacy.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: The 2016 presidential campaign of Donald Trump, an American businessman, television personality, and author, was formally launched on June 16, 2015, at Trump Tower in New York City.

  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"Which of the campaign that brought out the term Vichy Republican on social media was formally launched on June 16, 2015, at Trump Tower in New York City?\", this makes me think of the 2016 presidential election and how social media played a significant role in it. The term \"Vichy Republican\" seems to be associated with the Republican Party and its stance during that time. However, the user might actually be trying to pinpoint a specific campaign that popularized this term, and I'm not sure yet how the event at Trump Tower on June 16, 2015, fits into this broader context.\n\nAnalyzing the existing results, I notice they lack the precise information we're looking for. The results focus more on the 2016 campaign in general, without directly linking the term \"Vichy Republican\" to a campaign launched at Trump Tower on June 16, 2015. This tells me that our search terms might not be specific enough or that we need to explore different avenues to find the connection we're seeking.\n\nLet me approach this using the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal technique, which involves constructing a conceptual graph and traversing it to find high-value expansion terms. This should help because it allows us to systematically explore semantic relationships between the terms in our query and other relevant concepts.\n\nFirst, I identify the core concepts and entities in the original query: \"Vichy Republican\", \"campaign\", \"social media\", \"Trump Tower\", and \"June 16, 2015\". The search intent is informational, aiming to identify a specific campaign. There's an implicit assumption that the campaign is related to the 2016 presidential election.\n\nNext, I build the conceptual graph with these components: core nodes (the entities/concepts from the query), first-order connections (direct properties and relationships), second-order connections (related concepts one step removed), and domain contexts (specialized fields like politics and social media).\n\nFor expansion path selection, I identify promising directions: synonymous terms (e.g., \"Trump supporter\" for \"Vichy Republican\"), hierarchical terms (broader concepts like \"political campaigns\" or narrower ones like \"Republican primary campaigns\"), compositional terms (parts or attributes like \"social media strategy\"), contextual terms (settings like \"US presidential elections\"), and domain-specific terminology (terms specific to political science or social media analysis).\n\nNow, let's apply the technique's steps systematically while allowing for natural cognitive elements. Following the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal approach, I should first explore synonymous terms for \"Vichy Republican\". Wait, that's not quite right for this query; we're looking for a campaign, not just a term. Let me adjust my approach to focus on campaigns related to the 2016 presidential election and the term \"Vichy Republican\".\n\nThis step of the technique is revealing that the term \"Vichy Republican\" might be closely associated with critiques of the Republican Party's support for Donald Trump, which actually reminds me of the concept of political polarization. I need to consider the next step in the technique, which involves identifying hierarchical terms, but I'm also noticing an interesting pattern where social media campaigns played a crucial role in the 2016 election. This pattern suggests that the campaign we're looking for might have had a strong social media presence.\n\nApplying the specific aspect of the technique related to contextual terms leads me to discover that the event at Trump Tower on June 16, 2015, was indeed the formal launch of Donald Trump's presidential campaign. This realization connects to what we were exploring earlier - the significance of social media in political campaigns, especially in how terms like \"Vichy Republican\" emerge and spread.\n\nI just had another realization that connects to our earlier exploration of synonymous terms; if \"Vichy Republican\" is associated with supporters of Donald Trump within the Republican Party, then the campaign we're looking for is likely his presidential campaign. Following the technique pointed me toward the concept of political campaigns, but my instinct says we should also consider the role of social media in spreading political terms and ideas.\n\nThrough this process of applying Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal and exploring related threads, I believe the terms \"2016 presidential campaign\", \"Donald Trump\", \"Republican Party\", \"social media strategy\", and \"political polarization\" would be most effective for expanding our query. These terms capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking - the specific campaign that popularized the term \"Vichy Republican\" on social media and its link to the June 16, 2015, event at Trump Tower.\n\nThe final expanded query, considering the insights from both the structured technique and natural thought patterns, should effectively retrieve documents that discuss the 2016 presidential campaign of Donald Trump, the emergence of the term \"Vichy Republican\" on social media, and the event at Trump",
