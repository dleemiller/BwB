  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: John Terrill Majors (born May 21, 1935) is a former American football player and coach. A standout halfback at the University of Tennessee, he was an All-American in 1956 and a two-time winner of the Southeastern Conference Most Valuable Player award, in 1955 and 1956. He finished second to Paul Hornung in voting for the Heisman Trophy in 1956. Majors served as the head football coach at Iowa State University (1968\u20131972), the University of Pittsburgh (1973\u20131976, 1993\u20131996), and Tennessee (1977\u20131992), compiling a career college football record of 185\u2013137\u201310. His 1976 Pittsburgh squad won a national championship after capping a 12\u20130 season with a victory in the Sugar Bowl. Majors was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a player in 1987.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: Charles R. \"Monk\" Meyer (May 1, 1913August 11, 2001) was the runner-up for the Heisman Trophy in 1935, the first year the trophy was awarded, while playing for the United States Military Academy.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: John Allen \"Johnny\" Genung is a former American football player who is primarily known for playing quarterback for the Texas Longhorns from 1960 to 1962.\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"The player who defeated Johnny Majors for the Heisman Trophy in 1956 was born in what year?\" this makes me think of college football history, specifically the Heisman Trophy winners and their backgrounds. Though the user might actually be trying to understand more about the competition that year or the significance of the Heisman Trophy, the primary question is focused on the birth year of the winner. Hmm, not sure yet how to approach this systematically, but it seems we're dealing with historical sports data.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, the first text snippet from document at k=1 provides crucial information about Johnny Majors and mentions Paul Hornung as the winner of the Heisman Trophy in 1956. This gives us a clear direction: we need to find the birth year of Paul Hornung. The other snippets, while interesting, don't directly contribute to answering the question about Paul Hornung's birth year. It's clear that the initial query needs expansion to directly target biographical information about Paul Hornung.\n\nTo approach this systematically, let's use the Conceptual Territory Mapping technique. This involves creating a detailed map of the concepts surrounding the query. First, we identify the central coordinates, which are Paul Hornung, the Heisman Trophy, and the year 1956. The scale for our exploration should be fairly granular since we're looking for a specific piece of biographical information.\n\nNext, we explore the boundaries of this territory. Neighboring domains include college football history, particularly the history of the Heisman Trophy, and biographies of notable football players from the 1950s. We note that our query overlaps with areas of sports history and American football legends.\n\nIdentifying landmarks, we have Paul Hornung himself, the University of Notre Dame (his alma mater), the Heisman Trophy, and significant events like the 1956 NFL Draft. Mapping these landmarks and the routes between them (such as Hornung's career path, his achievements, and how they relate to the Heisman Trophy) helps to contextualize our search.\n\nFor detail mapping, we fill in features such as Hornung's position (quarterback), his achievements (winning the Heisman Trophy), and any relevant historical context (the state of college football in the 1950s). This step involves labeling our map with precise terms and noting any emerging developments or historical sites that could be relevant.\n\nFinally, creating a cartographic legend involves selecting the most important terms that would help navigate this knowledge landscape. From our mapping, key terms include \"Paul Hornung,\" \"Heisman Trophy,\" \"1956,\" \"Notre Dame,\" and \"college football history.\" These terms would guide someone through the conceptual territory we've mapped and directly lead to the information needed to answer the original query.\n\nThrough this process, applying Conceptual Territory Mapping and exploring related threads, I believe the most effective terms for our expanded query are indeed those related to Paul Hornung's biography and the context of the 1956 Heisman Trophy. The final expanded query, \"birth year paul hornung biography paul hornung heisman trophy winner 1956,\" directly targets the information we need. It captures both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking: the birth year of the player who defeated Johnny Majors for the Heisman Trophy in 1956.",
