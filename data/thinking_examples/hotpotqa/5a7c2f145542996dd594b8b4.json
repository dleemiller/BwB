  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"The actress who made her film debut in Friday Night Lights also starred in a 2014 French-American crime-thriller directed by whi?\", this makes me think of Amber Heard, though the user might actually be trying to find more information about her filmography or the specific thriller she starred in. The mention of \"Friday Night Lights\" and a \"2014 French-American crime-thriller\" gives us two solid leads to work with.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, we see that Amber Heard is indeed the actress we're looking for, and she starred in the 2014 film \"3 Days to Kill\". The results, however, include some irrelevant information, such as details about her early life and other roles she's played. To refine the search, we need to focus on keywords directly related to the target film and potentially explore related genres or themes within the actress's filmography.\n\nLet's transition to a structured approach using the given expansion technique. This technique involves being specific and diverse, applying varied augmentation techniques such as synonym replacement, conceptual expansion, contextual expansion, and domain-specific terminology. By following this approach, we should be able to discover new, relevant documents across various domains without overlapping the original terms.\n\nStarting with goal elucidation and gaps, the primary objective of the query is to identify the actress and the 2014 French-American crime thriller she starred in. A gap in the query is the lack of specificity regarding the director of the thriller. Ineffective terms that should be avoided include broad or non-precise terms like \"the\".\n\nFor breadth expansion, we can list candidate terms with increasingly distant concepts to the original query, such as \"crime fiction\", \"French cinema\", \"action thrillers\", \"2014 films\", and \"Amber Heard filmography\". These terms introduce new dimensions to the query and help us explore related genres and themes.\n\nFor depth expansion, let's choose \"French cinema\" as a distant but important topic and go increasingly deeper in the related terms. This could include terms like \"international film\", \"European crime dramas\", \"Neo-noir\", and \"psychological thriller\". These terms help us focus on the specific genre and style of the 2014 French-American crime thriller.\n\nAs we apply the expansion technique, we start to see insights emerging from both structure and intuition. The systematic application of the technique's steps helps us identify relevant terms, while our natural thought patterns and intuitive connections complement the technique by suggesting related concepts and themes. For instance, the term \"psychological thriller\" emerges as a key term, which is both a specific genre and a style that fits the description of the 2014 film.\n\nThrough this process of applying the expansion technique and exploring related threads, I believe the augmented query should include terms that capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking. The final terms should emerge logically from both the technique and natural insights, ensuring a balanced and effective search query.\n\nGiven the task outcomes, the augmented query is \"Amber Heard French cinema psychological thriller crime fiction 2014 films\". This query is novel, free from overlapping the original terms, and includes unique, diverse, and targeted terms that are contextually or peripherally relevant to the original query.",
