  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"What film was written and directed by Joby Harold with music written by Samuel Sim?\" this makes me think of a very specific piece of information that the user is trying to find. Though the user might actually be trying to find details about a particular film, I'm not sure yet what genre or era they're interested in. My initial association is with films from the 2000s, given the names provided, but I need to analyze the results of the original query to point out strengths and weaknesses of the search terms.\n\nThe initial results show a strong relevance to the query, especially with the first text snippet mentioning \"Awake\" as a film written and directed by Joby Harold. However, there's no direct mention of Samuel Sim in relation to the music of \"Awake.\" This discrepancy suggests that while we're on the right track with Joby Harold, we might need to expand our query to better capture the involvement of Samuel Sim or to explore films with similar characteristics.\n\nLet me approach this using the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal technique, which involves constructing a conceptual graph of the query's core concepts and entities, and then traversing this graph to find high-value expansion terms. This should help because it systematically considers various aspects of the query, from direct properties and attributes to broader contexts and related concepts.\n\nFollowing the technique, I first identify the core concepts: \"film,\" \"Joby Harold,\" \"Samuel Sim,\" \"written,\" \"directed,\" and \"music.\" The search intent is informational, aiming to identify a specific film. Implicit assumptions include that the film is a feature film (not a short or documentary) and that Samuel Sim's involvement is significant enough to be noted in the film's credits or discussions about it.\n\nConstructing the conceptual graph, I include core nodes like \"Joby Harold\" and \"Samuel Sim,\" and first-order connections such as \"film director,\" \"screenwriter,\" and \"composer.\" Second-order connections might include genres, release years, or other collaborators. Domain contexts could involve the film industry, specifically areas like production, direction, and composition.\n\nFor expansion path selection, I consider synonymous terms (e.g., \"movie\" for \"film\"), hierarchical terms (e.g., \"cinema\" as a broader concept), compositional terms (e.g., \"soundtrack\" as a part of a film's music), and contextual terms (e.g., \"thriller\" as a genre). Given the initial results, focusing on terms related to film genres, roles within film production, and specific collaborators could be fruitful.\n\nExtracting and filtering terms, I look for relevance, distinctiveness, specificity, and searchability. Terms like \"thriller,\" \"conspiracy,\" \"screenwriter,\" \"filmmaker,\" and \"composer\" emerge as strong candidates. The mention of \"Awake\" in the initial results solidifies the relevance of these terms, especially considering its genre and the roles of Joby Harold.\n\nThrough this process of applying Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal and exploring related threads, I believe terms such as \"film,\" \"movie,\" \"thriller,\" \"conspiracy,\" \"screenwriter,\" \"filmmaker,\" \"composer,\" \"soundtrack,\" and \"score\" would be effective for expanding the query. These terms capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, including the specifics of Joby Harold's and Samuel Sim's roles and the type of film they're associated with.\n\nThe final expanded query, \"film written directed Joby Harold composed Samuel Sim soundtrack score,\" incorporates these insights, aiming to retrieve documents that not only match the original query's specifics but also provide a broader context and related information about the film in question.",
