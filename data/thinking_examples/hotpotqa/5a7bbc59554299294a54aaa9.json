  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: Costa began playing tennis at the age of five. He first came to the tennis world's attention as an outstanding junior player. In 1993, he reached the French Open junior final and won the Orange Bowl. He turned professional later that year and quickly established a reputation as a strong clay court player. Spanish former player and commentator for Spanish television Andr\u00e9s Gimeno used to call him \"the man with two forehands\", because he could hit with the same accuracy and strength both forehand and backhand. In 1994, he won two challenger series events and was named the ATP's Newcomer of the Year.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: Steve Denton (born September 5, 1956, in Kingsville, Texas) is a former professional tennis player for the ATP Tour. He is currently the head men's tennis coach at Texas A&M University.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: Nduka Odizor and Van Winitsky won in the final 6\u20133, 7\u20135 against Steve Denton and Sherwood Stewart.\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"Steve Denton and Albert Costa are both tennis players, which one began playing at the age of five?\" it makes me think of the early life and career beginnings of these tennis players. Though the user might actually be trying to find specific biographical information, the query seems too broad and could use some refinement. The results provided include information about Albert Costa's early start in tennis, but there's limited information about Steve Denton's early life and career.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the term \"tennis players\" is too broad and doesn't help in narrowing down the search to the specific information we're looking for. The text snippets from the initial results provide some insights, but they don't directly answer the question. For instance, we learn that Albert Costa began playing tennis at the age of five, but there's no similar information about Steve Denton.\n\nTo approach this query expansion, I'll use the technique of combining breadth and depth expansion. This involves identifying ineffective terms, listing candidate terms with increasingly distant concepts, and then choosing one topic to delve deeper into. The goal is to introduce new dimensions to the query without overlapping with the original terms.\n\nFirst, I identify \"tennis players\" as an ineffective term because it's too general. Then, for breadth expansion, I consider terms like \"childhood,\" \"early life,\" \"career beginnings,\" \"junior tennis,\" and \"sporting history.\" These terms are more specific and could help in finding relevant information about Steve Denton and Albert Costa.\n\nFor depth expansion, I choose \"junior tennis\" as a topic to explore further. This leads me to consider terms like \"youth sports,\" \"developmental stages,\" \"pediatric training,\" \"age-specific competitions,\" and \"talent identification programs.\" These terms are more targeted and could provide insights into the early careers of tennis players.\n\nAs I apply this technique, I realize that the augmented query should include terms that are both diverse and relevant. I need to ensure that the terms are unique, non-overlapping with the original query, and targeted towards finding specific biographical information about Steve Denton and Albert Costa.\n\nFollowing the technique, I start to see possibilities for expanding the query. However, I also have to consider my intuition and any patterns that emerge during the process. For instance, the text snippets from the initial results provide valuable information about Albert Costa, but I need to find similar information about Steve Denton.\n\nThrough this process of applying the expansion technique and exploring related threads, I start to identify key terms that could be included in the augmented query. The terms \"childhood,\" \"early life,\" \"junior tennis,\" and \"career beginnings\" seem relevant, but I need to ensure that they are precise and diverse.\n\nAfter reconsidering the terms and applying the expansion technique systematically, I realize that the augmented query should include terms that capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of the user's query. The final augmented query is \"steve denton albert costa childhood early life junior tennis,\" which includes targeted terms from the depth expansion and additional high-relevance terms.\n\nThe insights emerging from both the structured technique and my intuition lead me to believe that this augmented query will yield more focused results about Steve Denton and Albert Costa's ages when they began playing tennis. By balancing the structured approach with natural thought patterns, I've been able to create an augmented query that is novel, free from overlapping terms, and targeted towards finding specific biographical information.",
