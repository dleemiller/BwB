  "thought_process": "As I begin to expand the query \"Where will the 2017 Atlantic 10 Men's Basketball Tournament be hosted?\" I'm immediately drawn to the specifics of the event. The user is looking for a precise location, which implies they're either interested in attending the tournament or are researching it for some other purpose. My initial impressions are that the answer should be straightforward, given the specific year and event mentioned.\n\nAnalyzing the results from the original query, I notice that the top documents all mention the 2017 Atlantic 10 Men's Basketball Tournament in the context of its host location, Pittsburgh, and the venue, PPG Paints Arena. This confirms my initial assumption that the query's intent is informational, seeking a specific piece of data. However, I also recognize that simply confirming the host location might not fully address the user's underlying interests or needs. They might be looking for related information such as the tournament schedule, participating teams, or even details about the venue itself.\n\nTo systematically approach the query expansion, I decide to use the Conceptual Graph Traversal technique. This involves identifying core concepts and entities in the original query and then constructing a conceptual graph that includes these elements and their relationships. The core concepts here are \"2017 Atlantic 10 Men's Basketball Tournament,\" \"host location,\" and \"venue.\" The entities include \"Pittsburgh\" and \"PPG Paints Arena.\"\n\nAs I construct the conceptual graph, I consider first-order connections such as the tournament's schedule, participating teams, and the venue's characteristics. Second-order connections might include related events, the history of the tournament, or other sports events hosted at PPG Paints Arena. Domain contexts for this query would involve college basketball, sports venues, and possibly tourism or event planning in Pittsburgh.\n\nFor expansion path selection, I identify several promising directions:\n1. **Synonymous terms**: Using alternative names or phrases for the tournament or the venue.\n2. **Hierarchical terms**: Broader concepts like \"college basketball tournaments\" or narrower ones like \"Atlantic 10 Conference venues.\"\n3. **Compositional terms**: Parts or attributes of the tournament, such as \"men's basketball,\" \"2017 schedule,\" or \"Pittsburgh sports events.\"\n4. **Contextual terms**: Settings or scenarios where this information is relevant, such as \"March 2017 sports events\" or \"Pennsylvania basketball tournaments.\"\n\nAs I traverse the conceptual graph and explore these expansion paths, I extract high-value terms that are relevant, distinctive, specific, and likely to appear in relevant documents. Some examples include \"Atlantic 10 basketball championship,\" \"Pittsburgh sports venues,\" \"2017 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament,\" and \"PPG Paints Arena events.\"\n\nInterspersing my systematic approach with natural thought patterns, I consider the user's potential interests and how they might be connected to the initial query. For instance, someone looking for the host location of the 2017 Atlantic 10 Men's Basketball Tournament might also be interested in the teams that participated, the tournament's outcome, or even hotels near PPG Paints Arena if they're planning to attend.\n\nThrough this process, insights emerge from both the structured technique and my intuitive connections. I realize that expanding the query to include related concepts like \"Atlantic 10 Men's Basketball Tournament schedule,\" \"PPG Paints Arena seating,\" or \"Pittsburgh hotels near Consol Energy Center\" could significantly enhance the retrieval results, making them more comprehensive and useful to the user.\n\nSynthesizing my findings, I conclude that the most effective terms for expanding the query are those that capture the essence of the event, its location, and related information that could be of interest to someone searching for this topic. The final expanded terms should maintain the original search intent while providing alternative pathways for retrieval, enriching the search results with relevant and useful information.\n\nThe expanded query, incorporating these insights, could look like: \"2017 Atlantic 10 Men's Basketball Tournament hosted in Pittsburgh at PPG Paints Arena, including schedule, teams, and venue information.\" This approach balances the structured technique of conceptual graph traversal with the natural cognitive patterns of considering user interests and related information, leading to a more effective and informative search query.",
