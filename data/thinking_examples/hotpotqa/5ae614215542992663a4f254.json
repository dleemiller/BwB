An adaptation of the 1987 television series of the same name by Stephen J. Cannell and Patrick Hasburgh, the film follows two police officers who are forced to relive high school when they are assigned to go undercover as high school students to prevent the outbreak of a new synthetic drug and arrest its supplier.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: Althea Rae Janairo (born January 2, 1967), known professionally as Tia Carrere, is an American actress, model, voice actress, and singer who obtained her first big break as a regular on the daytime soap opera \"General Hospital\".\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: \"General Hospital\" is the longest running American television serial drama, airing on ABC. Created by Frank and Doris Hursley, who originally set it in a general hospital (hence the title), in an unnamed fictional city. In the 1970s, the city was named Port Charles, New York. The series premiered on April 1, 1963. This is a list of notable characters who significantly impacted storylines and began their run, or significantly returned, from the years of 2010 to present day.\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"Name an American actress who starred both in High School High and General Hospital,\" this makes me think of the challenge in finding someone who has bridged two very different genres - teen comedy and soap opera. Though the user might actually be trying to identify a specific actress who has made a significant career transition, I'm not sure yet what the motivations behind the query are.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I see that there's a lack of clear, direct references to actresses who have appeared in both \"High School High\" and \"General Hospital.\" The top results provide information on unrelated topics, such as the movie \"21 Jump Street\" and the background of actress Tia Carrere, who has been involved in \"General Hospital\" but not mentioned in the context of \"High School High.\" This suggests that the overlap between these two specific titles might be small or not well-documented.\n\nGiven the niche nature of the query, I'll approach it using the \"Query Expansion Through Journalistic Investigation\" technique, which involves treating the query as if I'm building a comprehensive story on the subject. This should help because it encourages a deep dive into related real-world terms and concepts that might not be immediately apparent.\n\nFirst, I assess the query to understand what the user is truly seeking. They want an American actress with experience in both a teen comedy (\"High School High\") and a soap opera (\"General Hospital\"). This indicates a need to identify actresses with diverse acting experiences and possibly those who have transitioned between comedic and dramatic roles.\n\nNext, I consider real-world contexts where this query is relevant. This includes professional contexts like the entertainment industry, educational settings where acting and media studies are taught, and personal situations where individuals might be interested in career transitions or the evolution of genres.\n\nInvestigating resources, I look for notable actresses, experts in acting career development, methodologies for transitioning between genres, and organizations involved in the production of teen comedies and soap operas. Essential terminology includes \"crossover actress,\" \"genre transition,\" and \"career evolution in acting.\"\n\nCreating headlines for articles that could address the query from multiple angles gives me:\n- \"From Laughter to Tears: Actresses Who Successfully Bridged Comedy and Drama\"\n- \"The Evolution of the Actress: How Genre Transitions Shape Careers\"\n- \"Crossover Queens: The Art of Shifting from Teen Comedy to Soap Opera\"\n\nExtracting terms from these headlines and the initial query gives me \"actresses,\" \"teen comedies,\" \"soap operas,\" \"crossover appearances,\" \"career paths,\" and \"genre transition.\" These terms are valuable for expanding the query because they represent both the specific request and the broader context of acting career evolution.\n\nFollowing the \"Query Expansion Through Journalistic Investigation\" technique systematically, I apply each step to ensure a comprehensive approach. However, I also allow for natural thought patterns, such as reconsidering the query's focus or making intuitive connections between the terms. For instance, thinking about \"crossover appearances\" reminds me of Tia Carrere, who has been mentioned in the initial results, and prompts me to consider other actresses who might have similar career paths.\n\nThrough this process, insights emerge from both the structured technique and my intuition. Applying the technique leads me to discover terms like \"career evolution\" and \"genre transition,\" which are crucial for understanding the query's context. My instinct also suggests considering the challenges and opportunities faced by actresses transitioning between genres, which could provide a richer understanding of the query's implications.\n\nSynthesizing my findings, I believe the expanded query should include terms that capture the essence of actresses' career transitions between teen comedies and soap operas. The final terms that emerge from this process are \"actresses,\" \"teen comedies,\" \"soap operas,\" \"crossover,\" \"career path,\" and \"genre transition.\" These terms logically combine the original query's intent with the insights gained from the journalistic investigation, enhancing the query to better reflect the user's underlying information needs.",
