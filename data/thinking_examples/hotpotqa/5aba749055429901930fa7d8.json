  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"What occupation do Chris Menges and Aram Avakian share?\" this makes me think of the film industry, though the user might actually be trying to find a specific job title that both individuals hold. Hmm, not sure yet, but it seems like we're dealing with two individuals who are likely professionals in the film sector.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that Chris Menges is identified as a cinematographer and film director, while Aram Avakian is described as a film editor and director. This gives me a starting point - they both seem to work in directing roles within the film industry. However, the initial results also highlight a potential issue with name confusion, as seen with the mention of a \"Chris Messer\" in one of the snippets, which is unrelated to our query. This suggests the need for precise terms to avoid false positives.\n\nTo approach this systematically, I'll use the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal technique, which involves constructing a conceptual graph and traversing it to find high-value expansion terms. This should help because it allows for a structured exploration of related concepts and entities that might not be immediately apparent from the original query or initial results.\n\nStarting with query analysis, the core concepts are Chris Menges, Aram Avakian, and their shared occupation, with the intent being informational - to find out what they do. There's an implicit assumption that they share an occupation within the film industry.\n\nBuilding the conceptual graph, I identify core nodes as the individuals and their occupations. First-order connections include their roles as directors and their involvement in the film industry. Second-order connections might involve specific genres they've worked in, notable films, or collaborations. Domain contexts include film production, direction, and cinematography.\n\nFor expansion path selection, I'm considering synonymous terms (e.g., \" filmmaker\" instead of \"director\"), hierarchical terms (e.g., \"cinematographer\" as a specific type of filmmaker), compositional terms (e.g., \"film crew\"), contextual terms (e.g., \"Hollywood\"), and domain-specific terminology (e.g., \"cinematography\").\n\nFollowing the technique, I extract and filter terms. For synonymous terms, \"filmmaker\" and \"movie maker\" could be relevant. Hierarchical terms might include \"cinematographer\" and \"producer.\" Compositional terms could be \"film crew\" or \"production team.\" Contextual terms might include \"Hollywood\" or \"independent films.\" Domain-specific terms like \"direction,\" \"editing,\" and \"cinematography\" are also potential expansion terms.\n\nI had a realization that connects to what we were exploring earlier - both individuals have directing roles, but they also have other significant roles in the film industry. This insight suggests that while \"director\" is a common occupation, looking into more specific or related roles might yield better results.\n\nApplying the specific aspect of the technique leads me to discover terms like \"cinematographer\" and \"film editor,\" which are directly related to the occupations of Chris Menges and Aram Avakian, respectively. My instinct says we should also consider terms that reflect their collaborative or project-based work, even though the initial query doesn't explicitly mention this.\n\nThrough this process of applying Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal and exploring related threads, I believe the terms that would be most effective for expanding the query are those that capture the specific occupations and the broader context of the film industry. Terms like \"film director,\" \"cinematographer,\" \"film editor,\" and \"filmmaker\" are directly relevant. Additionally, considering the domain and context, terms related to the film industry, such as \"movie production\" or \"Hollywood,\" could also be useful.\n\nSynthesizing, the expanded terms maintain the original search intent by focusing on the occupations of Chris Menges and Aram Avakian within the film industry, while providing alternative pathways for retrieval by including related roles and contexts. The final augmented query should effectively capture the essence of their shared profession and related activities in the film sector.",
