She was the Executive Producer of TED Media for TED (Technology, Entertainment, Design), until December 2015. She led the effort to bring the conference online, launching the podcast series TEDTalks in 2006, the redesigned TED.com in 2007, the TED Open Translation Project in 2009, the TED Open TV Project in 2010 and TED Conversations in 2011. Cohen joined the TED staff in 2005. She also produced TED's year-round salons, edited the TED Blog, and co-curated and co-hosted the annual conference in Long Beach, with TED curator Chris Anderson. She lives in New York City.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: Chris Anderson (born 1957) is the owner of TED, a nonprofit organisation that provides idea-based talks and hosts an annual conference in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Previously he founded Future Publishing.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: Garner Ted Armstrong (February 9, 1930 \u2013 September 15, 2003) was an American evangelist and the son of Herbert W. Armstrong, founder of the Worldwide Church of God, at the time a Sabbatarian organization that taught observance of seventh-day Sabbath, and annual Sabbath days based on Leviticus 23.\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"What Future Publishing founder co-hosted the annual TED Conference with June Cohen?\" this makes me think of the context of TED conferences and the role of its organizers. Though the user might actually be trying to identify a specific individual who co-hosted with June Cohen, the initial results already point towards Chris Anderson, but the search could be more focused and insightful. \n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, the strengths include correctly identifying Chris Anderson as the co-host, while weaknesses lie in the broadness of terms like \"Future Publishing\" and \"annual,\" which don't add much specificity to the search. It's clear that we're looking for someone involved in TED's leadership, specifically someone who has co-hosted the conference with June Cohen.\n\nTo refine this search, I'm going to approach it using the expansion technique provided, which involves being specific, diverse, and applying varied augmentation techniques such as synonym replacement, conceptual expansion, and domain-specific terminology. This should help because it will allow us to drill down into the specifics of TED's history and leadership, potentially uncovering more relevant and concise information.\n\nStarting with goal elucidation and gaps, the primary objective is to identify the TED co-host, with a gap in specific historical context and depth of involvement in TED organization. Ineffective terms include \"Future Publishing\" and \"annual,\" as they are too broad and don't contribute much to the specificity of the search.\n\nFor breadth expansion, we consider terms like \"TED conference history,\" \"early TED organizers,\" \"public speaking events,\" and \"innovation conferences.\" These terms offer a broader context but still keep the focus on TED and related concepts. However, to really deepen our search, we need to choose one of these areas and expand on it, which is where depth expansion comes in.\n\nFocusing on \"early TED organizers\" as our depth expansion topic, we can start listing terms that are increasingly specific: \"TED board members,\" \"founding members of TED,\" and even exploring the roles within these groups. This systematic approach helps to ensure that we're covering all relevant bases and not missing potential key terms.\n\nAs I apply this technique, I notice that terms like \"co-host,\" \"June Cohen,\" \"organizers,\" and \"founding\" start to emerge as central to our query. These terms are not only specific but also diverse, covering different aspects of TED's organization and history. The application of the expansion technique here is crucial, as it systematically guides us towards more targeted and relevant search terms.\n\nInterestingly, while following the expansion technique, I also have moments where I reconsider the path or make intuitive connections. For instance, realizing that the term \"annual\" might not be as crucial as initially thought leads me to focus more on the individuals and their roles within TED. This balance between structured steps and natural thought patterns is key, as it allows for both a systematic approach and the flexibility to incorporate new insights or adjustments as needed.\n\nThrough this process, insights start to emerge from both the structure of the technique and my own intuition. Applying the technique leads to the discovery of terms like \"TED conference history\" and \"founding members,\" which are directly relevant to understanding the context of the co-host's role. Intuitively, connections are made between these terms and the potential for other related concepts, such as the evolution of TED conferences over time or the significance of certain founders and their contributions.\n\nSynthesizing all this information with clarity, I believe the most effective terms for a BM25 index, based on our expanded query, would include \"TED,\" \"co-host,\" \"June Cohen,\" \"organizers,\" and \"founding.\" These terms capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking, providing a concise and focused search query that should yield more relevant results than the original.",
