  "thought_process": "Looking at the query \"Are After Midnight Project and Aaroh both rock bands?\"... this makes me think of how users often seek confirmation on specific details about music genres and bands. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the musical styles of both bands and possibly their similarities or differences, the surface-level question seems to focus on genre identification. Hmm, not sure yet how deep this inquiry goes, but it seems like there's an opportunity to explore beyond just yes or no answers.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that while there's some information about \"After Midnight Project\" being a rock band, there's a significant lack of details about \"Aaroh.\" This suggests a couple of things: first, the search terms might not be capturing the essence of what the user is looking for, particularly regarding \"Aaroh\"; second, there might be a need to expand the search beyond the immediate data points to uncover more about \"Aaroh\" and potentially comparative aspects between the two bands.\n\nLet me approach this using the \"Query Expansion Through Journalistic Investigation\" technique, which involves treating the query as a story that needs comprehensive research. This should help because it encourages a deep dive into the subject matter, considering various real-world contexts, expert opinions, and specific terminology that could be relevant.\n\nStarting with the real-world contexts, I identify that this query could be relevant in professional music criticism, educational settings discussing music genres, personal situations where individuals are exploring music tastes, and specialized communities of music enthusiasts. Each of these contexts could provide unique insights into what defines a rock band and how \"After Midnight Project\" and \"Aaroh\" fit into or challenge these definitions.\n\nMoving into resource investigation, notable experts in music criticism or genre classification could offer valuable insights. Established methodologies for categorizing music into genres, essential terminology used in the music industry, and organizations like record labels or music festivals could also play a crucial role. Fundamental concepts such as the evolution of rock music, sub-genres, and how bands are classified could further enrich the understanding of the query.\n\nCreating headlines for articles that could address this query from multiple angles helps to extract more focused search terms. For instance, \"Unlocking the Sound: A Deep Dive into Aaroh's Genre-Bending Music,\" \"Rocking the Night Away: Comparing After Midnight Project and Aaroh,\" or \"The Future of Rock: How Emerging Bands Like After Midnight Project and Aaroh Are Making Waves.\" These headlines not only provide a framework for understanding the query better but also highlight specific terms like \"genre-bending,\" \"emerging bands,\" and \"rock music evolution\" that could be critical in expanding the search query.\n\nAs I systematically apply the steps of the journalistic investigation technique, I also find myself making intuitive connections. For example, thinking about how \"After Midnight Project\" has been described as a rock band, I wonder if \"Aaroh\" might have a similar or completely different genre classification based on their musical style and critical reception. This leads me to consider terms related to music criticism, album releases, and the impact of genres on band identities.\n\nOccasionally, I reconsider my approach, wondering if I'm missing a simpler way to address the user's question, but each time, I come back to the realization that understanding the nuances of music genres and the specific cases of \"After Midnight Project\" and \"Aaroh\" requires a comprehensive and structured investigation.\n\nThrough this process, insights begin to emerge that connect both the structured approach and my natural thought patterns. Applying the journalistic investigation technique leads me to discover terms like \"genre-bending\" and \"emerging bands,\" which not only help in expanding the query but also provide a deeper understanding of what the user might be seeking. My instinct says that we should also consider the historical context of rock music and how it has evolved, which could further illuminate the positions of \"After Midnight Project\" and \"Aaroh\" within the genre.\n\nSynthesizing all these elements, I believe the expanded query should include terms that capture the essence of both bands' musical styles, their genres, and the comparative aspects between them. Terms like \"rock band,\" \"music genre,\" \"album release,\" \"critical reception,\" and \"musical influences\" are crucial. Additionally, considering the journalistic investigation's findings, terms such as \"genre-bending,\" \"emerging bands,\" and \"rock music evolution\" could significantly enhance the search query, making it more likely to yield results that fully address the user's underlying questions.",
