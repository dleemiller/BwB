  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"The Florida Atlantic Owls team represents a school classified by the Carnegie Foundation as what?\" this makes me think of university classifications and rankings, though the user might actually be trying to understand the specific categorization of Florida Atlantic University in terms of its academic and research profile. The immediate association is with athletic teams, but the core question seems to be about the educational institution's standing.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, it's clear that the current focus is heavily on athletic programs and teams, such as the women's basketball team, football team, and men's soccer team, with mentions of conferences, divisions, and stadiums. However, these results miss the educational context and the Carnegie Foundation's classification system, which is what the user is really asking about. The strengths of these search terms lie in their specificity to the athletic domain, but their weakness is in not addressing the academic classification aspect of the query.\n\nTo approach this more systematically, I'll transition to using a structured technique for query expansion, specifically focusing on the guidelines provided: being specific and diverse, applying varied augmentation techniques such as synonym replacement, conceptual expansion, contextual expansion, and domain-specific terminology. This should help in uncovering new dimensions to the query that are both novel and relevant, avoiding overlap with the original terms.\n\nStarting with goal elucidation and gaps, the primary objective is to identify Florida Atlantic University's Carnegie Classification, with a gap in understanding the university's categorization in terms of its academic and research profile. Ineffective terms that should be avoided include \"Florida Atlantic Owls,\" \"team,\" \"athletic,\" and \"programs,\" as they lead to results focused on sports rather than academic standing.\n\nFor breadth expansion, candidate terms could include \"university rankings,\" \"higher education institutions,\" \"academic classification,\" \"Carnegie classifications,\" and \"research universities.\" These terms introduce new dimensions by considering the broader context of university categorization and rankings.\n\nDelving deeper into one of these topics, such as \"Carnegie classifications,\" for depth expansion, we can explore terms like \"Carnegie Foundation,\" \"mission statement,\" \"doctoral programs,\" \"public/private institution,\" \"institutional research,\" and \"research activity levels.\" These terms offer a deeper understanding of what the Carnegie Foundation's classification entails and how it might categorize Florida Atlantic University.\n\nApplying the technique systematically and balancing it with natural thought patterns, I notice that focusing on the Carnegie Foundation's mission and its criteria for classification, such as the presence of doctoral programs and the level of research activity, could provide insight into Florida Atlantic University's classification. This step of the technique reveals the importance of understanding the foundational aspects of the Carnegie Classification system, which actually reminds me of the related concept of institutional accreditation and how it might also be relevant.\n\nConsidering the next steps in the technique, I need to think about how \"public institution\" and \"research activity levels\" could further refine the query, but I'm also noticing an interesting pattern where the emphasis on \"doctoral programs\" and \"research activity\" could be pivotal in determining the university's classification. This pattern suggests that the query should indeed focus on these aspects to capture the essence of what the Carnegie Foundation looks for in its classifications.\n\nThrough this process of applying the expansion technique and exploring related threads, I believe the terms that would be most effective for a query are those that directly relate to the Carnegie Foundation's classification criteria, such as \"Carnegie Foundation mission statement,\" \"doctoral programs,\" \"public institution,\" and \"research activity.\" These terms capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking regarding Florida Atlantic University's academic and research profile.\n\nThe final augmented query, \"Carnegie Foundation mission statement doctoral programs public institution research activity,\" reflects a balance between the structured approach of the expansion technique and the natural insights that emerged from analyzing the original query and its results. This query aims to provide a more precise and relevant search that addresses the user's underlying questions about Florida Atlantic University's classification by the Carnegie Foundation.",
