Introduced in June 2011 as a spin-off of the general-interest streaming platform, Justin.tv, the site primarily focuses on video game live streaming, including broadcasts of eSports competitions, in addition to creative content, \"real life\" streams, and more recently, music broadcasts. Content on the site can either be viewed live or via video on demand.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: Games Done Quick is a biannual video game speedrun charity marathon held in the United States, originally organized by the Speed Demos Archive and Speedruns Live communities. Since 2015, it has been handled by Games Done Quick, LLC. Held since 2010, the events have raised money for several charities; the most common two being the Prevent Cancer Foundation and Doctors Without Borders. The events are broadcast live on Twitch. Viewers are encouraged to donate for incentives during the stream such as naming characters in a run, having the runners attempt more difficult challenges, or winning prizes. Over $12 million has been raised across seventeen marathons.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: My 90-Year-Old Roommate is a Canadian comedy web series, which premiered in 2016 on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's Punchline comedy web platform. Created by Ethan Cole, the series stars Cole as a fictionalized version of himself, an underemployed young man who moves in with his recently widowed 90-year-old grandfather Joe (Paul Soles).\n",
  "thought_process": "As I sit down to expand the query \"Who owns the broadcasting platform where Games Done Quick is broadcast?\", my mind starts racing with potential avenues to explore. The first thing that comes to mind is the actual event, Games Done Quick, and how it's related to video games and charity fundraising. I recall reading about it being broadcast on Twitch, but I need to dig deeper to find out who owns the platform.\n\nUpon analyzing the initial results, I notice that the term \"platform\" might be too broad and could lead to irrelevant information. I see that Twitch is indeed the correct platform, but the results lack focus. This tells me that I need to refine the query to specifically target the ownership of the broadcasting platform.\n\nTo approach this systematically, I decide to use the expansion technique provided, which involves synonym replacement, conceptual expansion, and domain-specific terminology. I start by identifying the primary objectives and gaps in the original query, which leads me to focus on the broadcasting platform and its ownership.\n\nAs I examine the breadth expansion terms, I notice that \"online events\", \"video game streaming\", and \"charity fundraising\" are all relevant but might not directly lead to the ownership information I'm seeking. However, they do provide a good starting point for further exploration.\n\nWhen I dive into the depth expansion, I choose to focus on \"live streaming\" as a key concept. This leads me to consider terms like \"interactive content\", \"community engagement\", and \"viewer interaction\", which are all important aspects of live streaming platforms.\n\nAs I apply the expansion technique, I start to see connections between the terms. For instance, the fact that Games Done Quick is a live streaming event with interactive content and community engagement makes me think about the importance of viewer interaction. This, in turn, reminds me of the charity fundraising aspect and how it's tied to the live streaming experience.\n\nI have a brief moment of reconsideration when I think about the term \"charity viewers\", wondering if it's too specific or if it might not be directly relevant to the ownership of the platform. However, I realize that it's actually a key aspect of the Games Done Quick event and could potentially lead to information about the platform's ownership.\n\nAs I continue to apply the technique, I start to see a clearer picture emerge. The terms \"live streaming\", \"interactive content\", \"charity\", and \"viewers\" all start to come together to form a cohesive query that targets the ownership of the broadcasting platform.\n\nThrough this process, I've gained a deeper understanding of the relationships between the terms and how they can be used to create a more effective query. I've also been able to identify potential pitfalls, such as using overly broad terms, and have refined the query to specifically target the information I'm seeking.\n\nIn the end, I believe that the augmented query \"Games Done Quick live streaming interactive content charity viewers\" effectively captures the essence of the original query while introducing new dimensions and targeting the ownership of the broadcasting platform. This query balances the structured approach of the expansion technique with my natural thought patterns, allowing me to create a more effective and targeted search query.",
