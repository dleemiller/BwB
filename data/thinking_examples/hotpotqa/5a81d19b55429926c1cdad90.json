He is also a former state court judge.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: Odessa is a city in and the county seat of Ector County, Texas, United States. It is located primarily in Ector County, although a small portion of the city extends into Midland County. Odessa's population was 118,918 at the 2010 census making it the 29th-most populous city in Texas; estimates as of July 2015 indicate a population of 159,436 in the city. It is the principal city of the Odessa Metropolitan Statistical Area, which includes all of Ector County. The metropolitan area is also a component of the larger Midland\u2013Odessa combined statistical area, which had a 2010 census population of 278,801; a recent report from the United States Census Bureau estimates that the combined population as of July 2015 is 320,513. In 2014, \"Forbes\" magazine ranked Odessa as the third fastest-growing small city in the United States.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: Jessica Blain-Lewis (born February 24, 1979), also known simply as Jessica Lewis, is an American lawyer best known for competing on the reality competition show \"Survivor\".\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"Tryon D. Lewis is a lawyer from Odessa, Texas which is located in what county?\"... this makes me think of geographical locations and possibly legal professions, though the user might actually be trying to find the specific county where Odessa, Texas is situated. Hmm, not sure yet, but it seems like the query is more about geography than law.\n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that some texts directly answer the question by mentioning Ector County, while others provide more general information about Texas or legal professionals. This tells me that the term \"lawyer\" might be too broad and not very useful for pinpointing the location, and \"Odessa, Texas\" is somewhat more relevant but could still be refined for better specificity.\n\nI'm seeing several possibilities here... Let me approach this using the expansion technique, which involves being specific and diverse, applying varied augmentation techniques like synonym replacement, conceptual expansion, and domain-specific terminology. This should help because it allows me to introduce new dimensions to the query that are both relevant and unique.\n\nFollowing the expansion technique, I first need to elucidate the goals and gaps in the original query. The primary objective is to identify the county where Odessa, Texas is located. A gap in the query is its broadness and the inclusion of terms like \"lawyer,\" which doesn't directly contribute to finding the geographical location.\n\nNext, I identify ineffective terms that should be avoided. \"Lawyer\" seems to be one such term as it's not specific to the geographical query at hand. \"Odessa, Texas\" is somewhat relevant but could be expanded upon for more precise location-based terms.\n\nFor breadth expansion, I consider terms that are increasingly distant concepts from the original query but still relevant. This includes terms like \"West Texas,\" \"Texas counties,\" \"desert regions,\" and \"oil production.\" These terms help in understanding the broader context and could lead to more specific, relevant terms.\n\nThen, I move on to depth expansion, where I choose one of these broader terms and delve deeper into related terms. Choosing \"Ector County\" as a starting point, I explore terms like \"Midland County,\" \"Permian Basin,\" \"oilfield communities,\" and \"transportation routes.\" These terms are more specific and provide a deeper insight into the geographical and economical aspects of the region, which could be relevant for someone looking for detailed information about Odessa, Texas, and its surrounding areas.\n\nApplying the technique systematically, I also allow for natural cognitive elements to influence my thought process. For instance, considering the term \"Permian Basin\" leads me to think about its significance in oil production, which is an intuitive connection that complements the technique. Occasionally, I reconsider the relevance of certain terms, ensuring they align with the query's objectives.\n\nAs I balance the structured approach with natural thought patterns, insights begin to emerge. Applying the expansion technique leads me to discover terms like \"Ector County\" and \"Midland County,\" which directly answer the original query. The technique also helps in identifying peripheral terms like \"Permian Basin\" and \"oilfield,\" which, while not directly answering the query, provide contextually relevant information about the region.\n\nThrough this process of applying the expansion technique and exploring related threads, I believe the terms that would be most effective for a refined query are those that capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of what the user is seeking. The final expanded query, \"Ector County, Midland County, Permian Basin, oilfield,\" reflects this balance, incorporating direct answers to the geographical question while also providing relevant contextual information.\n\nThis thought process demonstrates how structured techniques can be enhanced by natural intuition and cognitive patterns, leading to a more comprehensive and relevant query expansion.",
