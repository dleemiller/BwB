The 82nd Orange Bowl was a College Football Playoff semifinal with the winner of the game competing against the winner of the 2015 Cotton Bowl: Alabama Crimson Tide football in the 2016 College Football Playoff National Championship, which took place at University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Arizona.

  "thought_process": "As I delve into the task of expanding the search query regarding the college football game between Clemson and Oklahoma at Sun Life Stadium, I'm initially drawn to the specifics of the event - the date it was played, the outcome, and the significance of the game. The original query seems straightforward, asking for the date of the game where Clemson defeated the No. 4 Oklahoma Sooners, 37-17, at Sun Life Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida. However, I recognize that users might approach this query from various angles, depending on their level of expertise, their motivations, and the context in which they're searching.\n\nMy first instinct is to consider the different types of users who might be searching for this information. There's the novice sports fan who might be looking for a memorable game to discuss with friends, the intermediate enthusiast seeking detailed outcomes for a sports debate, the advanced analyst compiling historical data on team matchups, and the expert historian researching the impact of significant games in college football history. Each of these personas would likely use different terminology and have varying levels of prior knowledge about college football and the specific game in question.\n\nAs I analyze the search vocabulary that these personas might use, I notice a progression from general terms like \"Clemson vs Oklahoma game\" to more specific references such as \"2015 Orange Bowl date\" and \"Clemson victory analysis.\" The intermediate and advanced users might also employ terminology related to game statistics, player performance, and the historical context of the game. This realization prompts me to think about how users' searches evolve as they gain more knowledge - from initial broad queries to more precise searches for specific data.\n\nThe technique of user intent and journey mapping comes into play here, as it helps in understanding how different searches reflect various stages of the user's learning process. By mapping out the information journey, I can identify key terms and concepts that users at different levels of expertise are likely to use. This approach also highlights the importance of contextual scenarios - whether the search is for casual discussion, academic research, fantasy football analysis, or historical documentation.\n\nAs I apply this technique, I start to see patterns emerge. High-value terms span from generic identifiers like \"college football game\" to specific event names such as \"2015 Orange Bowl.\" Intent-revealing terminology might include phrases that reflect the purpose of the search, such as \"game statistics\" or \"historical sports documentation.\" This systematic approach to understanding user intent and mapping their journey helps in identifying a comprehensive set of terms that can be used to expand the original query.\n\nHowever, I also recognize the value of allowing for natural thought patterns and intuition to influence the expansion process. This means considering the occasional false starts, tangents, and reconsiderations that are a natural part of human thinking. For instance, while applying the structured technique, I might stumble upon an interesting historical context or an analogous event that could provide additional insights or terms to include in the expanded query.\n\nThrough this balanced approach of structured technique and natural thought patterns, I begin to synthesize the insights gained. The expanded query should capture the essence of what users across different expertise levels and contexts are seeking. It should reflect not just the explicit ask of the original query but also the implicit needs and interests that users might have. By incorporating terms related to the game's outcome, its historical significance, statistical data, and the event's context, the expanded query becomes more comprehensive and likely to satisfy a wider range of user needs.\n\nThe final step in this thought process involves clarifying the expanded query based on the insights gathered. By combining the systematically derived terms with the intuitive connections and contextual understanding, I formulate an expanded query that is both logical and user-centric. The resulting query, such as \"Find the exact date and detailed outcomes of the Clemson vs. Oklahoma game at Sun Life Stadium in the 2015 Orange Bowl, including statistics on how Clemson secured their victory,\" reflects a deep understanding of user intent, information needs, and the natural evolution of searches related to this specific college football game.",
