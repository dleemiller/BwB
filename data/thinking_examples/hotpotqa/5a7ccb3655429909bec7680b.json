  "initial_results": "### Text snippet from document at k=1\n: Kaganoi Shigemochi (\u52a0\u8cc0\u4e95 \u91cd\u671b , 1561 \u2013 August 27, 1600) was a Japanese samurai of the Azuchi-Momoyama period, who served the Oda clan. He ruled Kaganoi Castle. During the Battle of Komaki and Nagakute, Shigemochi fought under his father Shigemune, who was attached to the forces of Oda Nobukatsu. Soon after, Kaganoi Castle was surrounded by the forces of Toyotomi Hideyoshi; Shigemune surrendered, and Shigemochi was employed by Hideyoshi as a messenger, receiving a stipend of 10,000 \"koku\". He also possessed a blade made by Muramasa, which Hideyoshi bestowed on him in 1598.\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=2\n: Muramasa Sengo (\u5343\u5b50 \u6751\u6b63 , Sengo Muramasa ) was a famous swordsmith who founded the Muramasa school and lived during the Muromachi period (14th to 16th centuries) in Japan. Oscar Ratti and Adele Westbrook said that Muramasa \"was a most skillful smith but a violent and ill-balanced mind verging on madness, that was supposed to have passed into his blades. They were popularly believed to hunger for blood and to impel their warrior to commit murder or suicide.\"\n\n### Text snippet from document at k=10\n: Tadeusz Tomasz Marzecki (born 16 April 1949) is a Polish voiceover provider, narrator and dubbing director who rarely appears in person on TV or in film.\n",
  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query, \"Who bestowed Kaganoi Shigemochi with a blade made by the person that founded the Muramasa school?\" This makes me think of Japanese history, specifically the era of samurai and famous swordsmiths. Though the user might actually be trying to understand the historical context surrounding the gift of a sword, I'm not sure yet what specific aspects they're interested in. \n\nAnalyzing the results of the original query, I notice that the top documents provide valuable information about Kaganoi Shigemochi, the Muramasa school, and even a mention of Hideyoshi, which seems crucial given the historical period. The strengths of these search terms lie in their specificity to Japanese history and samurai culture, while a weakness could be the potential for irrelevant information about swordsmithing techniques or unrelated historical events.\n\nTo approach this systematically, I'll use the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal technique. This involves constructing a conceptual graph around the core entities and concepts in the query and then traversing it to find high-value expansion terms. The core concepts here include Kaganoi Shigemochi, the Muramasa school founder, and the historical context of the gift.\n\nFollowing the technique, I first identify the core nodes in the graph: Kaganoi Shigemochi, the Muramasa school founder, and Hideyoshi. Then, I consider first-order connections such as their relationships (e.g., Kaganoi Shigemochi being gifted a sword by Hideyoshi) and attributes (e.g., the sword being made by the Muramasa school founder). Second-order connections might include other historical figures of the time, significant battles, or cultural practices related to samurai and sword gifting.\n\nFor expansion paths, I select synonymous terms (e.g., \"samurai\" for Kaganoi Shigemochi), hierarchical terms (e.g., \"Japanese swordsmiths\" for the Muramasa school founder), compositional terms (e.g., \"Azuchi-Momoyama period\" as the time when these events occurred), and contextual terms (e.g., \"gift-giving practices in feudal Japan\"). Domain-specific terminology could include terms like \"daimyo\" or \"shogun,\" considering the political structure of Japan during that time.\n\nExtracting and filtering terms based on relevance, distinctiveness, specificity, and searchability, I come up with a list of high-value expansion terms. These include \"Hideyoshi,\" \"Muramasa,\" \"samurai culture,\" \"Azuchi-Momoyama period,\" \"Japanese swordsmithing,\" \"feudal Japan,\" \"daimyo,\" and \"gift-giving customs.\"\n\nAs I apply the technique and consider these expansion paths, I have a realization that connects to what we were exploring earlier - the significance of the sword as a symbol of honor and the implications of Hideyoshi gifting such a blade to Kaganoi Shigemochi. This suggests that terms related to honor, loyalty, and the political alliances of the time could also be relevant.\n\nThrough this process of applying the Query Expansion via Conceptual Graph Traversal technique and exploring related threads, I believe the expanded terms would enhance the retrieval of documents related to the original query. The final expanded query could incorporate these terms to provide a more comprehensive search, potentially looking like: \"Kaganoi Shigemochi Hideyoshi Muramasa samurai culture Azuchi-Momoyama period Japanese swordsmithing feudal Japan daimyo gift-giving customs honor loyalty.\"\n\nThis approach ensures that the search intent remains focused on the historical event of the sword gifting while providing alternative pathways for retrieval that capture the broader context and related concepts.",
