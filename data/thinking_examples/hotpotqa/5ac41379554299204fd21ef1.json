His nonfiction book \"The Captive Mind\" (1953) became a classic of anti-Stalinism. From 1961 to 1998 he was a professor of Slavic Languages and Literatures at the University of California, Berkeley. He became a U.S. citizen in 1970. In 1978 he was awarded the Neustadt International Prize for Literature, and in 1980 the Nobel Prize in Literature. In 1999 he was named a Puterbaugh Fellow.

  "thought_process": "Let's start by examining the original query: \"Do Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz and Nathalie Sarraute have the same nationality?\" This makes me think of the historical context in which these authors lived and wrote. I'm considering the fact that Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz was a Polish poet and writer, while Nathalie Sarraute was a French writer. The user might be trying to understand the connection between these two authors, possibly in terms of their literary movements or cultural affiliations.\n\nLooking at the initial results, I notice that Nathalie Sarraute is described as a French lawyer and writer, while Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz is introduced as a Polish poet, prose writer, translator, and diplomat. This confirms my initial impression that they have different nationalities. However, I also see that Mi\u0142osz defected to the West in 1951 and later became a U.S. citizen, which adds a layer of complexity to his national identity.\n\nNow, let me apply the Query Expansion via Temporal Evolution Analysis technique to this query. This involves analyzing how the topic of these authors' nationalities has evolved over time and will likely develop in the future. I'll start by tracing the historical foundation of this topic, identifying key evolutionary stages, and noting how language and concepts have transformed over time.\n\nThe historical foundation of this topic lies in the early 20th century, with the rise of modernism and the development of distinct literary movements in Poland and France. I see that Mi\u0142osz's work was influenced by European modernism, while Sarraute was associated with the French New Wave movement. The developmental milestones in this topic include the post-war era, the Cold War, and the emergence of existentialist themes in literature.\n\nAs I move to the current landscape, I notice that the topic has become more nuanced, with a focus on transnational literature, globalized literary discourse, and interdisciplinary approaches to literature. The emerging trends in this area include digital literature, speculative fiction, and climate change narratives.\n\nNow, let me extract temporal terms from each time period. I have terms like \"Polish Literature,\" \"French Literature,\" \"European Identity in Literature,\" and \"Cold War Literature\" from the historical foundation and developmental milestones. From the current landscape, I have terms like \"Contemporary Fiction,\" \"Transnational Literature,\" and \"Globalized Literary Discourse.\" Finally, from the emerging trends, I have terms like \"Digital Literature\" and \"Speculative Fiction.\"\n\nAs I apply the Temporal Evolution Analysis technique, I'm also considering my intuition and natural thought patterns. I'm making connections between the historical context, literary movements, and cultural affiliations of these authors. I'm noticing patterns and themes that emerge across different time periods, such as the influence of existentialism on both Mi\u0142osz and Sarraute's work.\n\nThrough this process, I'm gaining a deeper understanding of the complexities surrounding the nationalities of Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz and Nathalie Sarraute. I'm seeing how their literary movements, cultural affiliations, and historical context all contribute to a rich and nuanced topic. The expanded query terms that emerge from this analysis include \"Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz,\" \"Nathalie Sarraute,\" \"Polish Literature,\" \"French Literature,\" \"European Identity in Literature,\" \"Cold War Literature,\" and \"Existentialist Themes in Literature.\"\n\nThese terms capture both the explicit and implicit aspects of the user's query, providing a comprehensive understanding of the topic. By applying the Temporal Evolution Analysis technique and incorporating my natural thought patterns, I've developed a nuanced and informed approach to expanding the query.",
