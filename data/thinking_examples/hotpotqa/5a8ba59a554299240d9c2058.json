  "thought_process": "Looking at the original query about The Duke Steps Out starring an actress ranked tenth on a list of greatest female Hollywood stars, my initial impression is that this involves understanding both the historical context of the film and the ranking system used by the American Film Institute (AFI). The query seems to be pointing towards identifying the year Joan Crawford was ranked as one of the greatest female stars. However, to approach this systematically, I need to break down the information and apply a structured technique.\n\nThe initial results from the query provide interesting insights, particularly the text snippets that mention Joan Crawford and her ranking by the AFI. For instance, the first snippet directly states that Joan Crawford was ranked tenth on the AFI's list of greatest female stars of Classic Hollywood Cinema in 1999. This already gives us a strong clue about the answer we're looking for. Nevertheless, to ensure we're capturing the full scope of the query and to apply the expansion technique effectively, let's delve into the Temporal Evolution Analysis.\n\nStarting with the Historical Foundation, we note that the American Film Institute was established in 1967, and its early focus was on preserving and promoting American film heritage. The AFI's lists of greatest films and stars are considered benchmarks in the industry, reflecting both critical acclaim and public recognition. The Developmental Milestones highlight significant events such as the release of the AFI's first list of 100 greatest American films in the 1990s and the publication of the '100 Years...100 Stars' lists in 2007. These milestones indicate how the AFI's recognition and ranking processes have evolved over time.\n\nThe Current Landscape shows that the AFI remains a respected authority, with its rankings influencing public opinion and film criticism. The inclusion of diverse voices and the consideration of cultural impact and longevity in their rankings are notable trends. Emerging trends point towards greater international recognition, the use of data analytics, and potential online community engagement in the ranking process.\n\nApplying the Temporal Evolution Analysis, we extract terms from each period that are relevant to Joan Crawford and the AFI's rankings. From the historical foundation, terms like \"Classic Hollywood Cinema\" and \"American Film Institute\" are foundational. Developmental milestones add terms like \"100 greatest American films\" and \"100 Years...100 Stars.\" The current landscape contributes terms related to diversity and cultural impact, while emerging trends might include \"international film talent\" and \"digital platforms.\"\n\nThrough this analysis, we can see how the query's context expands beyond a simple ranking to encompass the evolution of film recognition and the criteria used by the AFI. The final delta value and the augmented query suggest that focusing on Joan Crawford, the AFI ranking, greatest female stars, and the specific timeframe of the 1990s to 2007 will yield the most relevant information.\n\nGiven the systematic application of the Temporal Evolution Analysis and the insights from the initial results, the expanded query logically includes terms that capture the historical, developmental, and current aspects of the AFI's rankings and Joan Crawford's career. This approach not only answers the original question about the ranking year but also provides a deeper understanding of how such rankings are determined and how they reflect the broader landscape of film history and criticism.",
